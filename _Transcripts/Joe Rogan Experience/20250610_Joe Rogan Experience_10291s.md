# Joe Rogan Experience #2335 - Dr. Mary Talley Bowden
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns)
*  All right. Very nice to meet you. I have I saw you on the Danny Jones podcast and I've [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=0.0s)]
*  read a lot of your tweets and Twitter and just the entire ordeal that you've been through [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=21.2s)]
*  since the beginning of COVID. And so I felt like it could be very educational for people to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=28.32s)]
*  hear your perspective. Well, I appreciate you continuing to talk about COVID because I think [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=35.28s)]
*  a lot of people are sick of it. I'm certainly ready to move on. I am too. But it's just people [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=40.72s)]
*  need to make sure this doesn't happen again. Exactly. You know, nothing's happened. Really [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  nothing's been corrected. No, not only has nothing been corrected. I was just watching an argument on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  television where they were trying to argue for vaccinating women who are pregnant. Oh, right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=57.12s)]
*  It's insane. I mean, there's a there's a golden rule of pregnancy, right? You don't you don't [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=64.64s)]
*  experiment on pregnant women. You don't experiment on an unborn child. You're not even supposed to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=70.08s)]
*  eat sushi. Exactly. Right. But we're going to put this modified mRNA technology into these women who, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=75.2s)]
*  you know, early treatment, we have early treatment. COVID is no longer a threat. We're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=83.36s)]
*  dealing, you know, at one point it was more than a cold, but not now. Why in the world will we give [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=88.08s)]
*  them to pregnant women or children? The only thing that makes sense is money. Right. Well, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=93.44s)]
*  it's the only thing that makes sense. And ego, meaning because they've already recommended it [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=98.48s)]
*  because they don't want to admit that it's not effective. They don't want to admit their side [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=104.16s)]
*  effects. I mean, we have we have hard facts showing it should be pulled off the market. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, any other product would have been pulled a long time ago. If this were an antibiotic and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=112.24s)]
*  we'd seen all the carnage from an antibiotic, it would have been yanked off long ago. It should [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  have been yanked off in the first month. There's just there's no other explanation than there's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=121.6s)]
*  just there's fraud, there's corruption, there's ego, there's money. But it's not science. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=128.88s)]
*  No. And there's a lot of people that for whatever reason, they have this very rigid ideology [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=135.68s)]
*  that the pharmaceutical drug companies are to be trusted. And we should trust the science and that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=142.4s)]
*  all these organizations, whether it's the FDA or whatever it is that's connected to these [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=148.24s)]
*  assertions, they should be trusted, not just the average doctor who's talking about these side [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  effects and all these different things that they're experiencing with their patients. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I trusted them when the pandemic started. I mean, I didn't think that the shots [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  would work necessarily, but I trusted them. I didn't think they were going to hurt us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Why didn't you think they would work? Because they were rushed to the market. I knew the flu [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=173.68s)]
*  shots were already iffy. We're dealing with a virus that mutates. We've never been able to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=177.68s)]
*  vaccinate against a cold, which, you know, it's a rapidly mutating virus. It's it's it's been tried [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=182.16s)]
*  before and it's failed. If you don't mind, please tell everybody what your background is in in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=188.88s)]
*  medicine. Yeah, private practice, solo physician. I'm not head of the Mayo Clinic. I'm just a, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=195.84s)]
*  you know, neighborhood ear, nose and throat doctor that sort of got tangled up in this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=202.72s)]
*  inadvertently. And I always thought when the pandemic started, I thought, well, this will be [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=207.84s)]
*  the hospital. This will be a chaos in the hospitals. I never envisioned getting wrapped up in this at [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=212.48s)]
*  all. I, you know, I trained at Stanford and then I moved to Texas after residency. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=217.36s)]
*  And then I worked in a small private practice for seven, eight years. Then I started having a bunch [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=225.68s)]
*  of children and I pretty much gave up medicine. I took a seven year sabbatical. I wasn't even sure [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=231.12s)]
*  I was going to go back. But then I just had this itch that needed to be scratched. And I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  opened up a solo practice six months before the pandemic started. Oh boy. What timing. I know. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=242.88s)]
*  Why? Why did I do it? You could have been out. I know. Yeah. Well, sometimes the universe has a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  calling for people, you know. It's been a very interesting journey. I mean. So take us through [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  what happened with you at the very beginning. Like so COVID, COVID starts making its way across the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=264.64s)]
*  world. Yeah. So I had people coming in with respiratory tract infections that were stubborn. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=271.2s)]
*  They were not, you know, the typical colds. And there was all this news that there's this virus [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=277.12s)]
*  from China. But, you know, you watch something on the news, you think, oh, you know, that's not going [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=283.12s)]
*  to really affect me. But, you know, I started having more and more patients coming in. And [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=286.48s)]
*  first I really didn't know what to do. I just used common sense. I mean, I treated the symptoms. I [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=291.76s)]
*  used breathing treatments. I covered for secondary infection with antibiotics. I used steroids, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=296.24s)]
*  that sort of thing. And I had success, but I didn't have a lot of people, you know, showing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=302.64s)]
*  up at my doorstep treat me for COVID. But I did start having people wanting to get tested. And [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=305.92s)]
*  you might remember that LabCorp was the first lab in the country to offer the test. And they just [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  got completely slammed. So it took two weeks to get the results back. We were already working. I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=318.32s)]
*  was already working with a lab for patients with chronic sinusitis who they were doing PCR testing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=324.4s)]
*  for chronic sinusitis. So tests for bacterial and fungal infections of the sinuses. It's called [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  Microgen DX. And they came out with a saliva test for COVID. So we were able to get the results back [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  the next day. So I started offering that and my little clinic exploded because, and I'm located [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  in a strip mall, which is very purposeful. I'm very close to the medical center, which is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  to get your doctor's office. It's a 10 minute navigation of the parking garage and another [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=354.56s)]
*  10 minute walk to the office. And so I was trying to locate my office where it was very easy to get [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  in and out of. And then that served me very well during the pandemic because with these saliva [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=366.0s)]
*  tests, you could just take the cup to somebody's car. They could spit in the cup. They could leave [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  it outside. It was contact free. You didn't have to even shoved up your nose. And then we got the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=376.0s)]
*  results back the next day. And so that sort of made me, put me on the map in my little neighborhood. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=380.88s)]
*  And then I started tracking, you know, who, when the vaccines came out, I started tracking [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=386.8s)]
*  who was positive, you know, by their vaccination status. And so I started noticing that the vaccine [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=392.0s)]
*  wasn't working and that's sort of what got me in trouble. I also started giving monoclonal [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=397.44s)]
*  antibodies and I didn't ration them. So I became known in town as a place you could get monoclonal [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=403.6s)]
*  antibodies without, you know, having to pass, you know, being a certain race or a certain [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=408.64s)]
*  age or that sort of thing. What do you think that was all about? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=413.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, but the monoclonal antibodies is very frustrating to me. They worked very well. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=418.56s)]
*  They were not controversial. People would turn around the next day. But when they first came out, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=423.36s)]
*  I could get as many doses as I wanted. I mean, they show up at my doorstep the next day. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=430.88s)]
*  And it was great. I mean, that's, that also sort of put me on the map with COVID. And then I didn't [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=435.28s)]
*  even use ivermectin until the government took over distribution of monoclonal antibodies. And then [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=441.28s)]
*  it became harder and harder to get them. And that's when I turned to ivermectin. But, you know, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=446.24s)]
*  in my opinion, they did that on purpose. They did that to encourage people to take the COVID shot. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=451.04s)]
*  It was very orchestrated. If you look at the timing, in March, the government [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  put out the big information on ivermectin and why you should not take it for COVID. They put that [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=465.84s)]
*  on the FDA's website. At the same time, they launched COVID-19 Community Corps. And this was [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=471.67999999999995s)]
*  April 1, 2021. This was an $11.5 billion dollar slush fund to propaganda to, you know, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=478.08s)]
*  feed out propaganda and censor people. And the day that they launched the COVID-19 Community Corps [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  was the same day that Houston Methodist, which is where I had privileges, they mandated the COVID [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  shots for all their employees, and they were the first in the country. And that's sort of how I got [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  tangled up in all this because I had privileges there. And then I was actually working with them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=506.32s)]
*  I was doing research with them. I was sharing my data with them to try to get it published. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=511.28s)]
*  But then I started questioning, you know, the vaccine and how it wasn't working. I brought it [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=515.6s)]
*  to their attention first, and they gaslit me. They just said, well, it just lowers severity. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=522.64s)]
*  And when they ignored me, then I started speaking out on social media. And that's what got me in [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=529.52s)]
*  trouble. But so that summer 2021, that's when the third and the largest surge of the pandemic [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=534.72s)]
*  started. And this was after the rollout of the wonderful COVID shots that were promised to stop [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  transmission and prevent death and obviously didn't. And the government was getting frustrated. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=548.72s)]
*  So they doubled down on their ivermectin attack. And this was end of August 2021. They put out the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=555.2s)]
*  infamous horse tweet, said, seriously, y'all, you're not a horse. You're not a cow. Stop it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=562.0s)]
*  A tweet went viral. It had dire consequences, in my opinion. And then they fully approved the COVID [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=566.96s)]
*  shot. And then Biden mandated for employers with 100 more employees. And that was right when they [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=575.44s)]
*  took you down. So it was all very coordinated. Oh, and then the final straw was taking away [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=582.64s)]
*  monoclonal antibodies. Yeah, that was the more fascinating thing about it to me is I listed a [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=589.44s)]
*  bunch of different things that I took, including monoclonal antibodies. But they only concentrated [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=596.08s)]
*  on ivermectin. But the way they did it was so transparent, changing the color of my face on CNN [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  and everywhere, this concerted effort to call it horse dewormer. They just tried to make it look as [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=609.5200000000001s)]
*  preposterous as possible without ever explaining that it's been used more than multiple billions of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=614.96s)]
*  times prescribed to human beings. Yeah, I mean, they branded you. When I think of you, I think of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=622.72s)]
*  that picture of you where you're slightly green. Honestly. Yeah, but ivermectin, I was nervous [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=627.84s)]
*  about using it because of all the hype. And because monoclonal worked so well, I was like, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=637.52s)]
*  well, this is not going to work. I was nervous. But the first thing I did was dug into the safety, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=644.08s)]
*  and anybody could do that, which is a minimal amount of effort. You can go to the FDA website [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=650.48s)]
*  and you can find the toxicity data on ivermectin. And there's something called the LD50, lethal dose [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=655.12s)]
*  50, which is a benchmark number that gives you an idea of how toxic a medication is. And LD50 means [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=660.88s)]
*  how many animals, what dose would kill 50% of lab animals. So for ivermectin, it kind of depends on [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  the rat, I mean, the type of animal and the gender, but it's basically 10 milligrams per kilogram, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=677.44s)]
*  up to 80 milligrams per kilogram. So for COVID, we're using 0.4 milligrams per kilogram. So I knew [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=683.44s)]
*  that we were not worried about killing people with it. And then I did a literature search and I looked [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=689.2800000000001s)]
*  for accidental intentional overdoses for ivermectin, and I couldn't find a single study. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=695.2s)]
*  Whereas you do that for Tylenol, I mean, thousands, thousands of reports. So once I knew it was safe, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=700.48s)]
*  then I started using it and then I found it worked. And then all in all, I treated well over 6,000 [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=706.08s)]
*  patients and everybody that got early treatment stayed out of the hospital. I also had patients [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=712.6400000000001s)]
*  come in that were really sick in the second week. And that was such a learning experience for me, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=718.24s)]
*  because normally if somebody walked into my office with an oxygen saturation in the low 80s, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=723.84s)]
*  I would call an ambulance. But I had patients who were refusing to go to the hospital. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=730.48s)]
*  And I had to give them the option to possibly die in my office, which is scary. But we saved them. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=737.6s)]
*  I mean, we just threw the kitchen sink at them and we didn't have monoclonal antibodies. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=744.24s)]
*  So we brought them in every day. We did IV steroids. We did IV antibiotics. We gave them [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=748.96s)]
*  home oxygen. We gave them high dose of ivermectin. We did everything we could. And it was amazing. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=754.72s)]
*  They survived. It was very gratifying. So you think it was probably a combination [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=760.64s)]
*  of all the different medications and all the different treatments? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=765.84s)]
*  I would vary my approach depending on the severity, the comorbidities. I mean, it's an art, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=768.96s)]
*  a protocol, it's a guideline. But every patient is sort of individual. And so for the patients, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  the one patient I'm thinking of, he had a history of two heart attacks. He had a history of throat [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=781.04s)]
*  cancer. He came in with an oxygen level. It was below 80. I can't remember exactly what it was. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=785.68s)]
*  But I mean, so I just did everything. I took everything that I could and gave it to him and [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=791.3599999999999s)]
*  it worked. And I had a few people like that. But if a 20-year-old came in, I'd probably just give [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=796.64s)]
*  him some ivermectin and it just depends. Why did you decide to try ivermectin even [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=802.4s)]
*  though there was all this negative propaganda? Well, because I had patients coming to see me [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=808.72s)]
*  who needed help. I mean, I just wasn't going to shut my door. I'd already established I could [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=814.0799999999999s)]
*  help people with monoclonal antibodies. So I still had people coming to me seeking help and I just [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=818.4s)]
*  didn't have the heart to say no. And I knew it was safe. So I knew that it was a little bit iffy, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=823.6s)]
*  but I knew it was safe and there was good data showing it worked. It's just, you know, one thing, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=829.68s)]
*  you can find a study to support any argument you want in medicine. I learned that in residency. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=833.92s)]
*  All residents learn that. We have something called Journal Club where you sit down once a week and [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=839.12s)]
*  you pour through different articles. And the takeaway is most articles are crap. They're not [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=844.64s)]
*  they're low power or they're conflicts of interest or they're designed poorly. So, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  you know, my mindset coming into the pandemic was, you know, the research, the journals are [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=860.32s)]
*  a starting point, but it's not the final say is your own clinical experience and what you're seeing. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=866.64s)]
*  And, you know, we had never seen COVID before. This was a brand new entity. So we were learning [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=874.24s)]
*  on the fly, but I've never treated this many patients with a single disease in my career. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=880.32s)]
*  I'm sure I never will again. And so you quickly become an expert and, you know, doctor, I don't [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=886.72s)]
*  can't speak for all doctors, but we like to do well. We like our patients to get better. It's [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  gratifying. That's how it's sort of how you get job satisfaction is seeing your patients do well. So [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=897.2s)]
*  why would I continue to have COVID patients come in if I couldn't help them? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=903.2800000000001s)]
*  And it's astounding to me that the doctors in the hospitals just didn't pivot, didn't try new [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  things. And I guess they were handcuffed by, you know, the hospital administrators, but it just [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=916.4799999999999s)]
*  seems to me that, you know, there was a doctor in Houston, Joe Varone, who I'm pretty good friends [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=921.68s)]
*  with, who a critical care doctor, and he was one of the founders of FLCCC, which is sort of the, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  they developed the original protocols for ivermectin. And Dr. Varone had much better [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=935.2800000000001s)]
*  success than most other doctors. His overall success rate was 4.4% of his patients died, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=940.72s)]
*  whereas in other hospitals averaged around 20%. And he did, he threw the kitchen sink at people. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=946.72s)]
*  And he basically followed this FLCCC hospital protocol. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=953.44s)]
*  So when the monoclonal antibodies were suppressed, what was the messaging? Like, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=959.0400000000001s)]
*  what did they say to doctors? They said that the strain of the virus was no longer covered, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=966.08s)]
*  so that it had evolved and it wouldn't work. At the same time, they're using the exact same vaccine. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=973.0400000000001s)]
*  Exactly. And they had switched the monoclonal antibodies periodically. So it wasn't like they [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=978.72s)]
*  started with one and stuck with it the whole time. They switched it as things evolved. But [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=983.52s)]
*  it was really clear. And the propaganda was shocking because we've all seen propaganda [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=989.6s)]
*  with foreign conflicts, weapons of mass destruction, all that jazz. We've all seen [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=996.88s)]
*  propaganda. But when Rolling Stone magazine printed an article saying that people were, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1000.8s)]
*  the hospitals were overflowing with people overdosing on ivermectin and gunshot victims [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1006.56s)]
*  couldn't get in. And then they used a stock photo, which was of a bunch of people wearing [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1012.56s)]
*  winter coats. And like, I think it was, I think the article was August in Oklahoma. Like the whole [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1016.7199999999999s)]
*  thing was, it was so brazen and sloppy and obvious, especially in the age of Google. If this had all [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1024.48s)]
*  gone down in the 1980s, we would all be in the dark. We would have no idea. We would have been like, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1034.56s)]
*  wow, I guess ivermectin is killing people. We wouldn't have known until like 2030. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1039.36s)]
*  You have been a conspiracy theorist. You've been a crazy person. Like one of those people that could [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1046.56s)]
*  tell you all the facts about the Kennedy assassination, with wild eyes, all over stone. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  But it was so obvious and it was so confusing because I had had people on my podcast before [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1056.4799999999998s)]
*  where, you know, I had a doctor's on and I talk about foolish people that don't believe in [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1063.52s)]
*  traditional medicine. Like people that want to try different things. Like people that were [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1069.52s)]
*  anti-vaccine or anti anything. These are the best people at the front of the line. Trust them. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1073.44s)]
*  Five years later, I'm like, don't trust anybody. They're all compromised. It's all money. And [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1079.68s)]
*  that was the most disheartening thing. The propaganda was disheartening, but it was that [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1084.0s)]
*  the whole system is compromised. And then when I found out that pharmaceutical drug companies, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1090.4s)]
*  they're the ones that are funding studies and that they could have a whole ton of study. They [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  don't have to divulge all the data from their studies. They only have to show you some studies [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1101.3600000000001s)]
*  that were carefully crafted to show efficacy. But all the other studies that they had that even [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1106.4s)]
*  showed negative effects, they could bury those. They weren't held responsible. I was like, what is [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1111.2800000000002s)]
*  this? Like what is this? It's but it's like everything in the world when money gets involved. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1117.52s)]
*  You know, that Rolling Stone tweet is still up. I found it yesterday. I couldn't believe it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1124.4s)]
*  Wild. Look at that. Look at these people wearing winter coats. So apparently this was a bunch of [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1129.2s)]
*  people that were waiting in line for the flu shot. Gunshot victims. Those people got shot. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1134.8s)]
*  What the fuck is going on in Oklahoma? They're just shooting folks. They think it's the Wild West [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1139.52s)]
*  out there. Imagine if those were all gunshot. But look how crazy that article is or that tweet is. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1143.84s)]
*  Gunshot victims left waiting as horse dewormer overdoses overwhelm Oklahoma. By the way, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  zero horse dewormers there. Zero. It was a total lie. Well, in a, you know, even last Friday, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1157.76s)]
*  Vanity Fair did an article on Maha and Cali Means and they quoted me in it. And in, you know, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1166.48s)]
*  in their description of me, they used horse dewormer. I could not believe it. Still! Catherine [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1173.68s)]
*  Ebon, the reporter for Vanity Fair. Wow. And she buddied up to me, acted like we were good friends. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1180.16s)]
*  That's how they always do it. Yep. This episode is brought to you by Better Help. Sometimes it [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1186.08s)]

*  it can feel like you have to carry that burden on your own. There's a lot of stigma around men [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1194.72s)]
*  being the provider to keep it all together by themselves. But that's not good for you, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1199.3600000000001s)]
*  your family or anyone. Did you know that six million men suffer from depression every year [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1205.2800000000002s)]
*  in the U.S.? And it often goes undiagnosed because of these stigmas. Real strength isn't [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1210.8000000000002s)]
*  bottling things up inside though. It's admitting to your faults and doing something to better [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1215.6000000000001s)]
*  yourself. So go talk to someone, a friend, your partner, family, a therapist. Therapy is an [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1220.8s)]

*  like how to manage stress and help you live a more balanced and fulfilling life. Better Help is a [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1231.68s)]

*  God, I just have massive respect for journalists. If I had never done this podcast, I would be your [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1276.88s)]

*  news. I kind of liked it better then. It was a lot easier, right? Ignorance is bliss. I didn't think [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1289.28s)]
*  the world was filled with demons, money hungry demons that are willing to sacrifice human lives [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1295.76s)]
*  in the pursuit of revenue. It's crazy. That's why we have to continue this fight because people [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1301.44s)]
*  have lost all trust with good reason. With good reason. That's why I'm having you on. That's why [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1308.24s)]

*  For me, it was such a wake up call because it's so weird to see your face on TV green, first of all. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1323.2s)]
*  That was weird. Then this term, horse dewormer. I'm like, why you guys aren't concentrating on [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1329.44s)]
*  the fact that a 55-year-old man is fine three days later during the worst strain. It was during the [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1333.68s)]
*  Delta where everybody's freaking out, this one's going to kill us all. I was fine in three days. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1340.56s)]

*  I got COVID, but I'm good now. I didn't think that was going to be anything. I thought that [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1349.84s)]
*  was just going to be the people that bought tickets to see Dave Chappelle and I in New Orleans. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1355.84s)]
*  That was going to be, was it Nashville? Wherever it was. That's all it was going to be. Those folks, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1360.6399999999999s)]
*  they're going to be upset. I'm sorry. We'll make it up to you. Your tickets still count. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1365.04s)]
*  That's all I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be like a normal [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1369.36s)]
*  tweet that I put out or a normal Instagram post that I put out. Then all of a sudden, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1372.16s)]
*  I hear that Neil Young wants to be removed from Spotify. I was like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1377.0400000000002s)]
*  This is crazy. Spotify got calls from two former presidents. Really? Oh yeah. What about, did they [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1383.0400000000002s)]
*  deplatform? Did you get censored or deplatformed? No, I grew by two million subscribers in a month. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1391.76s)]
*  I did. Because people started listening because they made it sound like I was this maniac. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1396.88s)]
*  They started listening. They're like, oh, he's really reasonable and pretty humble about all [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1402.64s)]
*  this stuff and just asking questions and bringing people on. Like Dr. Robert Malone, who has nine [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1406.88s)]
*  patents in the invention of mRNA vaccine technology. He took it himself. He was reporting [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1412.72s)]
*  his insane adverse side effect where he almost died. He was telling about it and they labeled [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1422.08s)]
*  him a kook for that. What made you so awake though? Well, that. Just Malone? That. No, well, Malone, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1427.52s)]
*  Peter McCullough. I've always been the type of person that is like, if someone is saying something [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1437.1999999999998s)]
*  and they have rock solid connect. Dr. Peter McCullough is the most published physician in his [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1444.24s)]
*  field in human history. This is an incredibly well respected doctor up until he took a moral [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1450.8s)]
*  and ethical stand saying that this is not what they're saying. This is not what we should be [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1458.0s)]
*  doing. And then destroyed. They tried to destroy his career. He's had a horrible. It's insane. But [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1463.04s)]
*  the man has incredible courage and he was labeled all kinds. When I would tell people he's the most [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1469.6s)]
*  published physician in time, you'd see their eyes glaze away. They didn't want to hear it. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1474.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm like, maybe he's right. Well, five years later, we know he's right. We know he was right. He [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1478.32s)]
*  was right all along. I mean, the whole. So for me, when there's, there's always a bunch of people [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1483.4399999999998s)]
*  that are ideologically or financially captured. And then there's people that feel morally obligated [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1490.8799999999999s)]
*  to tell the truth. And you can spot those people. And when I spotted a few of them, like, okay, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1498.08s)]
*  let me hear them out. I might be the guy that goes, no, this guy's a kook and he's going to [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1502.48s)]
*  cost people lives. Or I might be someone who, Hey everybody, hit the brakes. Like you might be [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1506.96s)]
*  getting bamboozled here. And especially the real concern with any sort of a new drug is always the [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1512.72s)]
*  side effects. But when you have indemnity, when you have complete immunity for any financial [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1521.28s)]
*  liability, like the vaccine manufacturers do, and all you have to do is label it a vaccine. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1527.1200000000001s)]
*  Because that's not a traditional vaccine. It's just not, they changed the definition for mRNA [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1532.56s)]
*  vaccine technology. Before that, it was not that it was a very different thing. We all had in our [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1538.64s)]
*  head, vaccines are good. That's why they don't get sued because we need vaccines. And then, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1544.08s)]
*  then unfortunately I read Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s book, the real Anthony Fauci. I was like, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1551.12s)]
*  Oh my God. What was your initial thought about the COVID shot? What was your mindset? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1555.52s)]
*  I was ready to take it. Did you take it? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1561.68s)]
*  No, I didn't take it, but that's why they were so mad at me. I was ready to take it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1563.44s)]
*  The UFC had allocated shots for all the Johnson Johnson, for all their employees. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1568.8799999999999s)]
*  And I showed up there on a Saturday, which was the day of the fights. And I said, can you give it to [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1574.24s)]
*  me? And they said, yeah, sure. Let's call the doctor. We'll set it up. I thought I was going [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1580.16s)]
*  to get a shot. I thought it was like a flu shot. Like I'll get that shot and I'll go do the [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1584.0s)]
*  broadcast. I was going to do the broadcast. I didn't think anything of it. I was not worried [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1586.88s)]
*  about it at all. And they said, no, you have to come to the clinic and do it. Could you do that [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1590.4s)]
*  on Monday? And I said, I can't, but I'll be back in two weeks during the time that I was trying to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1594.0s)]
*  get it. And then in two weeks later, when the next fights were, it got pulled from the market [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1600.0s)]
*  because of blood clots. And then two people I knew had strokes and I was like, hold the fuck up. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1604.96s)]
*  And then I got real nervous because there was a lot of family members that were like really pushing [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1612.64s)]
*  it. You need to get vaccinated. Everyone should get vaccinated. Have you gotten vaccinated? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1617.04s)]
*  Get vaccinated. We all need to do our part. We all need to get vaccinated. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1620.0s)]
*  And then I became a heretic. Then I was like, okay, I don't want to do it. And I had a bunch [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1623.6s)]
*  of friends that had horrible side effects, including one of them who is a young guy who [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1629.44s)]
*  is a pacemaker now. His heart stopped beating for like nine seconds at a time and he would black out. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1634.32s)]
*  It was wild shit was happening. And I was like, I don't understand why this isn't on the news. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1639.6s)]
*  I don't understand. And then I'm like, oh my God, I'm the news. I'm like, I have to be the news. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1646.08s)]
*  I don't want to be the news. I like talking shit. I like having a bunch of comedians here. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1652.24s)]
*  We have laughs. We get silly, you know, have a few drinks, watch some funny videos, crack each other, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1656.32s)]
*  have fun or scientists. I like to have fascinating people in here. Tell me how the cosmos was formed. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1661.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't want to be someone who distributes information to the masses. It's been lied to. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1666.96s)]
*  I don't have any lofty goals like that. Like I want to be the one who tells the truth. And that's [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1672.72s)]
*  not what I do. I'm just a curious person who talks to people. Was it hard for you to get Ivermectin? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1678.3999999999999s)]
*  No, I got it from India like that. I got boxes of it. I was handing it out to everybody. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1685.6s)]
*  Most people don't have to go to India to get their medicine. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1691.1200000000001s)]
*  That was after my doctor had got it for me. My doctor got it for me. I think I fucked it up [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1695.52s)]
*  for everybody. I think me becoming the attack boy when they went after me. I don't think they would [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1699.52s)]
*  have attacked anybody that didn't have a large platform like that. And I don't think they would, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1704.32s)]
*  I should say it better. I don't think they would have attacked Ivermectin the way they did. I think [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1709.92s)]
*  they would have just suppressed it and it wouldn't have been a public thing because it wouldn't have [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1713.04s)]
*  got out. I think the problem was me saying that. The crazy thing is I said all that other stuff too. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1716.0s)]
*  I said IV vitamins. I said Z-Pak, Prednisone. I told them all the things my doctor put me on [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1722.88s)]
*  and all they concentrated on was this Ivermectin thing. I was like, this is wild. What is going on? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1731.2s)]
*  And then I was like, am I wrong about Ivermectin? And then I started just reading about the [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1737.92s)]
*  scientists, the team that invented it and how they won a Nobel Prize. I'm like, okay, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1741.84s)]
*  what the hell is happening? This is nuts. This is so weird. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1746.6399999999999s)]
*  ≫ Well, it was all part of getting the shot in every arm. And they had to go after Ivermectin. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1750.24s)]
*  They launched a war on Ivermectin. Pierre Cori wrote a book about it. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1759.04s)]
*  ≫ Yes. I had Pierre on early on too. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1762.24s)]
*  ≫ Yeah. I actually sued the FDA over that horse tweet. And we won. It hasn't really changed [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1765.2s)]
*  anything. So the FDA, when they put that information or misinformation out against Ivermectin, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1772.0s)]
*  they were really crossing a line because they're not allowed to tell the public you can't take a [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1778.6399999999999s)]
*  medication for this or you should take a medication for that. They're basically allowed to just [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1783.92s)]
*  approve medications and move on. They can issue a safety alert if there's something that comes up. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1789.2s)]
*  But they're not allowed to really direct patients. And that's what they did. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1795.68s)]
*  And so we did sue them. And we won. And they had to take down the horse tweet. And they had to take [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1800.72s)]
*  down the misinformation on their website. But unfortunately, as evidenced by what just happened [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1806.08s)]
*  on Vanity Fair, I mean, the brand of it being only for animals still lives on. And it'd be great. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1812.56s)]
*  ≫ What happened at Vanity Fair? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1819.12s)]
*  So the reporter still used the term horse dewormer. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1820.8s)]
*  ≫ Oh, with the recent article. Wild. You're still a little horse dewormer, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1823.84s)]
*  Pusher. In 2025. When Chris Cuomo is out there talking about how he's taking it for long COVID. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1829.68s)]
*  ≫ Right. But it'd be great if the FDA could issue some sort of statement saying that it is safe, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1836.32s)]
*  that it is used in humans. They don't have to say much more than that. But we could use a little [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1845.44s)]
*  help in rebranding ivermectin. And there are also a bunch of states that are trying to make it over [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1850.72s)]
*  the counter. I'm not sure if you've seen that. 17 states have had bills in the last legislative [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1855.6000000000001s)]
*  session trying to get ivermectin over the counter. Three have been successful. So Tennessee, Idaho, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1861.92s)]
*  and Arkansas. Four is still in deliberations. And 10, they failed. But another thing the FDA, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1868.16s)]
*  I believe, should do is make ivermectin over the counter. Because people are basically going to the [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1876.64s)]
*  feed store. I mean, my own kid, he had some sort of scabies situation in West Texas over the weekend. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1881.2s)]
*  He had to go to the feed store to get treatment. And yeah, I did a poll on Twitter. 52% of the [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1888.88s)]
*  respondents said they go to the feed store to get their ivermectin. Is there any difference in the [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1895.68s)]
*  ivermectin from the feed store? I don't know. I mean, I haven't heard of anybody having issues. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1899.8400000000001s)]
*  But it's just unnecessary. This is America. We should be able to get the medication very easily. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1903.52s)]
*  And there is some sort of an efficacy for some sort of skin infections. Is that true? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1908.3200000000002s)]
*  Scabies is one of them. Yeah. But you use it topically? Is that how it's used? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1912.48s)]
*  You can. I mean, for scabies, actually, you can take it orally. But yeah, so we shouldn't have to [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  go to India. We shouldn't have to go to the feed store. We should be able to just go to, I mean, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1924.0s)]
*  a guy from India, he still emails me, you need any more, my friend? I don't know. That kind of worries [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1928.96s)]
*  me. I just bought boxes. I was handing out boxes to people because so many people were telling me [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1934.56s)]
*  they couldn't get it. And so I'm like, let me just get a lot of it while I still can. Yeah. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1939.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I guess it's probably fine, but it's just unnecessary. People are giving it to me at [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1944.16s)]
*  shows. Oh, they were as gifts? I carry around my purse. I like rummaging for something. Oh, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1948.88s)]
*  here's my ivermectin. Oh, I know people that take it as a prophylactic all the time. Oh, yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1955.1200000000001s)]
*  Which is so, it's just what a weird drug to go after that was on the World Health Organization's [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1959.3600000000001s)]
*  list of essential medicines. Yeah. How many people who had yellow fever and all the river blindness, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1965.2s)]
*  all sorts of different parasitic infections? It won a Nobel Prize. And it showed that it [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1971.7600000000002s)]
*  stopped viral replication in vitro. They knew that. I remember when I brought that up to Sanjay [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1976.96s)]
*  Gupta, it was like, but you know it does, right? And you can see the look on his face where it's [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1982.72s)]
*  like, he couldn't talk about that. He had to skirt around it and just do his best. But it was like, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1987.2s)]
*  this is kind of crazy to make an off label medication so taboo. And then to stop monoclonal [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=1993.76s)]
*  antibodies, just stop them. Well, you couldn't get them. It's criminal. My friend, one of his buddies [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2001.28s)]
*  was in the hospital and because he was in the hospital, they wouldn't give him monoclonal [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2006.24s)]
*  antibodies. Oh, yeah. If you cross that threshold, you are not going to get monoclonal antibodies. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2010.48s)]
*  What is that about? Does that make any sense to you? Well, they did it by the day. Apparently, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2016.08s)]
*  there was some data showing if you gave it too late in the time course, it actually makes things [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2020.0s)]
*  worse. How many people did they give it to that were too late? How do we know this? It's a little [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2024.08s)]
*  suspicious. It does seem suspicious because like, why would, if something, if you've shown something [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2029.28s)]
*  to be very effective done early on, wouldn't you assume it would continue to be at least somewhat [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2034.16s)]
*  effective? Now, if you're trying to stop someone who's on the brink of death, which this gentleman [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2040.88s)]
*  might want up dying and they didn't get it to him. If you're just trying to stop and [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2045.0400000000002s)]
*  you can't do it because you're in the hospital because you're admitted. Yeah. Like you should [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2051.2000000000003s)]
*  have like crazy data that shows like after 14, your feet fall off. 14 days of infection, your feet [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2055.52s)]
*  fall off. You go blind if you take it. Can't give it to you. My theory is they probably had a massive [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2061.04s)]
*  inflammatory response because we would see that. People would get the monoclonal antibodies and [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2066.48s)]
*  they would just feel like complete hell that night because there was like a little war going [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2070.72s)]
*  on in the body and then they would wake up the next day feeling great. I don't know if you had [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2074.88s)]
*  that experience. Yeah, I pretty much did. The second week of illness was the massive inflammatory [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2078.64s)]
*  response. So my thinking is the monoclonal antibodies may have just exacerbated that, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2085.28s)]
*  but they could have counteracted that with high dose steroids. And that was another thing. They [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2090.88s)]
*  gave these like piddly doses of steroids in the hospital. In what steroids in particular? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2094.7200000000003s)]
*  Methylprednisolone or Salumedrol was what we typically use. If we were in the hospital. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2100.32s)]
*  Is that prednisone what I took? Is that the same thing? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2104.0800000000004s)]
*  No. Well, prednisone is an oral. There are different types, but like I usually do a [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2106.1600000000003s)]
*  medral dose pack rather than prednisone because it's been shown to help better with respiratory. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2111.2s)]
*  It's not a huge deal, but in the hospitals they could give Salumedrol and high doses of that, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2116.3999999999996s)]
*  but they were giving very small doses of steroid, which is a problem. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2122.8799999999997s)]
*  Interesting. Well, that's also one of the things that they talked about in the RFK Junior book [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2127.6s)]
*  was that the studies that were saying that it was ineffective, the studies were not using the [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2133.84s)]
*  protocol that these doctors were using. And it seemed like these studies were designed to fail. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2141.84s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. And like I said, you can find a study to support or go against anything you want, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2146.96s)]
*  basically. So I just relied on my clinical experience and I just had so many people saying, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2154.32s)]
*  wow, it really made a big difference. And I saw people staying out of the hospital and it wasn't [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2160.4s)]
*  hurting anybody. But yeah, a lot of those studies were basically designed to fail either the dose [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2165.36s)]
*  wasn't high enough or they gave it too late or it was heavily funded by somebody that doesn't want [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2172.4s)]
*  it to succeed. Yeah. It's all very bizarre. It's really bizarre to live through. And for you as a [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2177.84s)]
*  person who was out of medicine and then said, jump back in six months before all this, like what is [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2185.6s)]
*  it like to have your worldview sort of like spun around like that? Yeah, it's just, I mean, it's [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2192.48s)]
*  good and bad. Like I feel sorry for the people that don't get it in a lot of ways. But I just [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  never thought it would come to all this. I didn't go back to work to have a huge, huge career. I was [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2206.0s)]
*  just basically trying to stay busy and active and help people. Yeah. But I didn't envision this at [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2213.6s)]
*  all. It's been very impactful. I'll say that. Yeah. What has it been like having to do this? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2220.16s)]
*  Having to do all these podcasts. Yeah, it's wild. Yeah, it's not what I envisioned at all. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2230.64s)]
*  But it's been, you know, I feel vindicated finally. At least I'm not embarrassed to go to the school [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2238.3199999999997s)]
*  functions anymore or show up at the sporting events or, you know, I used to be scared to go to the [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2243.9199999999996s)]
*  grocery store because they just, they came after me so hard. And Houston, I mean, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2249.04s)]
*  Houston Methodist Hospital is sort of the country club, you know, the elite of the hospitals. And [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2254.0s)]
*  so for them to come after me was a big deal. It's hard to get privileges there. You know, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2259.2s)]
*  their tagline is leading medicine. And they were very proud of being the first hospital in the [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2266.56s)]
*  country to mandate the shots. They didn't need to go after me. I mean, I was nothing. I was, you [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2271.36s)]
*  know, I saw a lot of COVID patients, but in the grand scheme of things, I really wasn't, you know, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2276.96s)]
*  I was not really doing anything. It's the Streisand effect, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, they attacked [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  you. And by doing so, they made the whole thing way bigger than it needed to be. But they did [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2288.24s)]
*  silence other doctors. I mean, I hear from doctors all the time that won't say anything [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2294.16s)]
*  because of what they did to me. Yeah, no, there's a lot of doctors that I know that were [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2298.8799999999997s)]
*  in danger of losing their license because they had prescribed ivermectin. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2303.7599999999998s)]
*  And that was another thing. You know, the Federation of State Medical Boards, which is this [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2307.52s)]
*  private entity, they're actually located in Texas, who oversees all the state medical boards. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2312.72s)]
*  They sent out a directive to all the state medical boards concerning ivermectin, concerning [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2319.52s)]
*  misinformation, and basically encouraging the medical boards to go after doctors like myself. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2325.1200000000003s)]
*  And I mean, I'm still tangled up with the medical board trying to clear my name. But they did that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2331.6800000000003s)]
*  That was, it all happened in that fall of 2021, right when Biden mandated the shots. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2338.7200000000003s)]
*  They really came down hard on the doctors. So what did they do specifically to you? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2345.84s)]
*  So I got several complaints, but only one of them is really stuck. The others have cleared my name [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2351.76s)]
*  on, but they're all involving ivermectin. No patient harm. The one that has stuck is from [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2358.1600000000003s)]
*  a hospital in Dallas called Texas Hugely Hospital. And there was this man, a sheriff's deputy, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2365.52s)]
*  father of six, who's basically dying. They were talking hospice, and his wife wanted him to have [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2371.04s)]
*  the opportunity to try ivermectin. And he had tried to get it before getting in the hospital [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2376.56s)]
*  and couldn't find a doctor willing to prescribe it. So wife knew he was okay with it. And so she [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2381.04s)]
*  sued the hospital. And then she asked me to come on as sort of the expert. They had to have a doctor [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2387.44s)]
*  who was willing to prescribe it because they can't force the doctors to prescribe a medication. But [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2392.96s)]
*  they could force the hospital to give a doctor privileges who was willing to prescribe it. So [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2398.24s)]
*  that's where I came in. And we won the case. And the hospital had a court order saying that they [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2403.52s)]
*  were going to give me emergency temporary privileges so that I could go into the hospital and give him [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2409.6s)]
*  ivermectin. Well, there was all this stall tactics. They were supposed to give me the privileges the [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2414.64s)]
*  same day. And in other circumstances, at that time, because of the pandemic, they were giving [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2420.64s)]
*  doctors same day privileges. It wasn't this lengthy application process because there was a [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2426.88s)]
*  shortage of doctors. But for me, they made me submit my surgical case log for the last three [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2432.08s)]
*  years. They made me get three letters of recommendation. They made me fill out like a [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2438.0s)]
*  30 page application. I got it all done in 24 hours. And then they're like, No, no, we're not, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2441.92s)]
*  we're actually going to deny you privileges. So it turned out in this big battle, it became very [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  confusing because they had to go back to the judge. And I finally got the green light, though, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2453.12s)]
*  the lawyers like we can go, you've got the green light, the judge, we got the order, there's no [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2458.0s)]
*  stay on the order. I send a nurse to the hospital because this is in Dallas, and I'm in Houston, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2462.64s)]
*  shows up with the court order and the police greet her and turn her away. There's not a big [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2468.24s)]
*  scene. She leaves, but she's not allowed to give him ivermectin. It turns out they did get a stay, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2474.64s)]
*  but our lawyers weren't aware of it at the time. But this is what they're going after me. They said [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2479.6s)]
*  that I sent a nurse to the hospital without privileges, and I caused a scene and I harmed [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  other patients by doing this. And it has been, I mean, it's three and a half years, they can't [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  find an expert witness to testify against me. There have been three continuances. They finally [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2497.36s)]
*  were awarded summary judgment against me. So I'm already decided, they've decided I'm guilty. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2503.44s)]
*  And now I'm waiting for my punishment. There was a hearing about a month ago [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2508.32s)]
*  to find out what they're going to find me with and that sort of thing. And I'm just waiting on that. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2513.04s)]
*  But I do plan on appealing. It's just gotten crazy. Wow. So the first thing they attacked you with [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2519.52s)]
*  was what? What was the first one? For the medical board? Yes. I had one pharmacist turn me in, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2529.92s)]
*  because we sort of got in a pissing match on the phone. And this is in 2021? That might have been, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2539.36s)]
*  I can't remember, but around that time. I had another, I had a father reach out to me, a 17 [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2546.64s)]
*  year old, had a history of a kidney transplant, and they were going to Europe and they wanted to [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2553.76s)]
*  have ivermectin just in case he got sick. And I was talking to the dad and the stepmother. I [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2559.52s)]
*  didn't realize I wasn't talking to the mother. So the mother found out I prescribed him ivermectin [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2565.36s)]
*  and turned me in. But ivermectin is metabolized by the liver, not the kidney. So it would be no [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2570.0s)]
*  harm for him to get, yeah, I was having had a kidney transplant for him to get ivermectin. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2578.64s)]
*  And he never took the medicine, but it cost me $16,000 in legal fees to get that straightened out. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2582.88s)]
*  So this was your first experience, like, oh my god, like, this is a real battle. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2590.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I've never been in any trouble. I've never been sued. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2596.08s)]
*  Would it feel weird publicly yet? Like, like when you when you were saying you were having a hard [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2600.8s)]
*  time going to the grocery store, you're worried that that was when Methodist came after me. So [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2605.44s)]
*  Methodist, they came after you very publicly. Yeah, they tweeted about me. They went to the, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2609.68s)]
*  I found out that my privileges were suspended from a text message from a reporter. That's how [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2614.08s)]
*  I found out. I looked at my phone, I was like, what are you talking about? I did. I said, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2618.48s)]
*  check your sources. I don't know what you're talking about. And then I go to my email and [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2624.0s)]
*  they suspended me and then they tweeted about it. And it went, you know, I had CNN, Washington [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2627.2s)]
*  Post going after me. It was it was it was traumatic. I mean, I was just a, you know, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2632.88s)]
*  a mom of four with a small practice. And all of a sudden, I've got CNN calling me. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2638.4s)]
*  Wow. What did what was going through your mind while that was happening? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2644.08s)]
*  Spent the weekend in the fetal position and a lot of tears. And then I was like, I was pissed. And [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2651.04s)]
*  I just on Monday, I hired a lawyer and I hired a guy to help me with the press. And I held a press [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2657.28s)]
*  conference on Monday, I resigned, and then I sued them. So and then I just have been working to try [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2663.92s)]
*  to clear my name. Wow. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2670.24s)]
*  It's just it's so hard to imagine for someone who's never experienced what you went through, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2676.3199999999997s)]
*  what that must be like emotionally to just get thrown to the wolves in front of the world, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2681.8399999999997s)]
*  like publicly by people like CNN, like where it gets so weird, because if that never happens to [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2690.08s)]
*  you, you look at CNN, you go, oh, they're the news, they're going to tell me the truth. That's I [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2697.6s)]
*  thought I just automatically thought that or they're at least saying what they're allowed to say, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2701.44s)]
*  maybe the government holds back some information, but they're not going to lie. And then I see my [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2707.44s)]
*  own self on TV. And I'm sure but I'm used to being attacked for things. I think the harder was, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2712.48s)]
*  is it CNN, whatever. But it's more just the locally like going to the grocery store, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2718.3199999999997s)]
*  going to the baseball game where your kids playing and like hoping, you know, sitting in a corner [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2722.64s)]
*  because you don't want anybody to see you. Did anybody ever bother you? No, honestly, no. But [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2727.2s)]
*  you just feel self you just feel very self conscious. It's hard not to. Yeah, even now, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2732.16s)]
*  I still feel self conscious, but it's a lot better. I mean, you know, I had a Mother's Day event of [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2736.56s)]
*  school and people actually came up and said nice things to me for once. So that was well, that's [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2743.52s)]
*  nice. Well, a lot of people got red pilled, you know, to use the matrix expression, you know, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2747.04s)]
*  where they woke up to what's really going on during I mean, it's kind of a masterful job of [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2752.64s)]
*  propaganda over the years that the pharmaceutical drug companies have done. I mean, because most [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2758.24s)]
*  people aren't even aware of how many drugs get pulled. They know they're not aware of the high [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2763.68s)]
*  percentage of them. What is it in the 30s? Yes, about 33%. They looked at it over 10 years, 33% [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2768.4s)]
*  had significant safety warnings on the drugs. And it took about four years for those to become [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2775.7599999999998s)]
*  recognized. I mean, their drugs I used to prescribe, they're no longer on the market. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2781.92s)]
*  I mean, yeah, so yeah, like I said, it would have been any other drug would have definitely [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2786.32s)]
*  been pulled by now based on all the adverse events we've seen. But it's just very profitable. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2792.48s)]
*  And that's what people have to wake up to. There's a bunch of factors, right? There's there's the [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2798.16s)]
*  primary one, which is a bunch of scientists that are really trying to help people. And they're [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2804.48s)]
*  really trying to develop new ways to cure Parkinson's and all sorts of other problems, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2809.44s)]
*  cancer. And these people are just constantly and then there's the money people, the money people [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2814.8s)]
*  who take that thing and say, how do we give Oxycontin to everybody? And then you have the [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2819.2000000000003s)]
*  Sackler family, right? You have evil, you have like actual evil. Maybe they don't have horns, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2823.12s)]
*  maybe they don't have a fork tail. But that's a demonic thing to do. You're infecting people [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2828.48s)]
*  with essentially something that turns them into a zombie, and it's killing people. But you're going [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2835.36s)]
*  to make a lot of money in health, especially in health. Well, it's because you're so trusted. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2839.52s)]
*  You're coming from a position of authority. It's a very different thing, you know, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2845.04s)]
*  especially in an area where most people are woefully ignorant. I mean, look how many doctors [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2849.84s)]
*  who are practicing doctors who are woefully ignorant about nutrition. Right. It's an enormous [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2855.84s)]
*  amount. Right. Now imagine the average person who has to go to a specialist about something, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2861.92s)]
*  and they're being told, oh, you need Vioxx. This is this thing I'm going to give you and it's going [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2868.56s)]
*  to cure your arthritis. Like, oh, great. And then you fucking stroke out. And the people who made [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2873.44s)]
*  that drug knew it was going to cause problems in people. In the emails that were admitted during [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2879.44s)]
*  the hearings when they lost or during the court proceedings, they wound up paying a fraction of [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2886.08s)]
*  what they made. They made like $12 billion. They had to pay, I think they had to pay five. So they [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2891.84s)]
*  made seven, you know, with, you know, it's costs and stuff, stuff costs money. But Jesus, it's so [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2897.52s)]
*  hard to wake up to that. It's so hard to like, go, wait, so they're not looking out for us. They're [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2905.68s)]
*  not trying to make us better. I always thought they were the people that were the most wonderful [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2912.4s)]
*  people in the world. They're the people that are providing the medication that's keeping everyone [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2916.88s)]
*  alive. This is why our life expectancy is a hundred years old now, as opposed to just 20 years ago. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2920.4s)]
*  Like, oh, great. Life expectancy has gone down actually. Whoops. Whoops. Despite all the vaccines. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2926.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And vaccines are even their own special class, right? It's the gospel, it's a [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2932.2400000000002s)]
*  religion. It's a gospel. I mean, we were, it was never questioned in my training. Never. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2938.4s)]
*  I would never question it. Not only that, I would not talk to anybody who did. I'd be like, get out [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2943.2000000000003s)]
*  of here. I'm not having an anti-vaxxer on the show. Fuck off. But after reading Suzanne Humphrey's [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2946.7200000000003s)]
*  book, and I had her on recently, reading that book, it was like, what? Wait a minute. What? And then [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2952.96s)]
*  just, this can't be true. And then just look at the raw data of like when the vaccines were [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2959.52s)]
*  introduced and also when hygiene was introduced and sanitation was introduced and then massive [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2963.76s)]
*  drop off of the disease. And then at the very end, when it's almost gone, vaccines are introduced [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2968.5600000000004s)]
*  in almost every case. And yet we all thinking like, thank God vaccines exist because otherwise we'd [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2973.36s)]
*  all have polio. Like, oh Christ. Yeah. It bothers me that I never questioned it. Never would have. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2979.36s)]
*  The polio one blew me away. When you find out that that was the same time where they were using DDT [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2986.8s)]
*  everywhere. And the people that were getting polio first were people in rural farmland communities [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2991.36s)]
*  where they sprayed DDT everywhere. And it wasn't just affecting people, it was affecting horses, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=2997.52s)]
*  and it doesn't cross species. So it wasn't the same thing. Clearly something was going on and [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3001.84s)]
*  everybody got locked into this polio scare. And to this day, I had a friend use that to me in a text [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3008.96s)]
*  message to me about like, look, we have to really appreciate that. He's like trying to make up for [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3015.84s)]
*  some stupid joke. And he was saying that, look, Jonah Salk cure polio. I'm like, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3021.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't have the time. I don't have the time to sit down and tell him there's a great book. It's [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3029.1200000000003s)]
*  called Dissolving Illusions. You should read it. And then you should read Turtles All the Way Down. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3032.96s)]
*  It's another great book. And then you should listen to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s journey from being a [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3037.1200000000003s)]
*  very respected and trusted environmental attorney who was applauded by the left to being some nut [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3043.92s)]
*  case pariah who I thought was a nut case. I had to apologize to him when I had him on the show. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3049.52s)]
*  I said, I have to tell you, when I first heard of you and I thought you were a kook, you're this [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3054.96s)]
*  anti-vaccine kook, I bought, I was living in LA working in Hollywood. Wee. I bought into it, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3060.64s)]
*  hook, line and secret. Everybody around me thought that way. So I thought we all, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3066.64s)]
*  this is what sensible, intelligent people think. Yeah. But I don't think you can really convince [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3070.32s)]
*  people. I think they have to figure it out themselves. No, they don't want to hear it. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3075.5200000000004s)]
*  That's the thing. It's like telling someone that their spaghetti monster in the sky is not real. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3079.2000000000003s)]
*  They don't want to hear it. You just can't. Right. I've just given up. But there's hope. I mean, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3084.88s)]
*  you came around and you're not in the field, right? And people, I think, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3092.4s)]
*  you know, COVID directly impacted every single American and not in a good way. Right. No, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3097.76s)]
*  there's nothing good about it. And the only thing good about it was a shift in perspective [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3103.2000000000003s)]
*  and that it's going to be way harder to pull some shit off like this again. Right. People are not [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3108.32s)]
*  going to buy into it, especially all those vaccine injured people who keep getting gas lit. Why do [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3112.8s)]
*  they keep calling it long COVID? How come nobody I know wasn't vaccinated got long COVID? Right. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3118.4s)]
*  What is this long COVID you speak of? Is there a long flu? Is there where's the long pneumonia? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3124.4s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? Why are you calling it? Is it possible that this is a [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3129.28s)]
*  vaccine injury? I'm just asking. Well, yeah, I've been looking at antibody levels in these people [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3134.4s)]
*  and it's alarming. So we have an ant that we really don't have a lot of tests for vaccine injured. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3140.08s)]
*  It's hard because they'll get the million dollar workup. By the time they come to see me, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3146.7200000000003s)]
*  they've gone through multiple tests and multiple doctors. It's not really a million dollars, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3152.64s)]
*  is it? The work? Well, I don't know, but I'm exaggerating. But I just want to be clear. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3157.6s)]
*  For some vanity fair, horse dewormer who claimed there was a million dollar markup. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3162.64s)]
*  I just had a like- Actually, somebody should fact check me on that. And it's probably higher [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3166.96s)]
*  than a million, but was like, oh, so they get, yeah, they go through the workup and then they [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3170.4s)]
*  can't find, they can't find a test to prove that they're injured. So the doctors will put them on [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3176.16s)]
*  psychiatric medication. They'll put them on sleeping pills and benzodiazepines and antidepressants. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3181.68s)]
*  Literally, I saw a patient was put on all three. So the only test that I have found that does seem [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3186.8799999999997s)]
*  to correlate is this antibody test. It's a spike protein antibody test. LabCorp has it. That's where [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3194.72s)]
*  I send people. Quest has it, but they put the upper limit is too low. So you don't really get [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  a good sense, but the upper limit of the test is 25,000. And people that have not gotten the COVID [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3206.0s)]
*  shots, I'd say it ranges, it's usually under a thousand. And then people that have gotten the [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3213.52s)]
*  shots, I mean, a lot of them are off the chart. They're over 25,000, but on average, they're [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3219.44s)]
*  probably 10 times higher than the people have not gotten the shot. And this is people who, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3225.6s)]
*  they were vaccinated four years ago. It wasn't like they just got the shot. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3231.28s)]
*  Obviously, COVID's not an issue anymore in terms of people getting sick, but four years later, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3235.3599999999997s)]
*  you should not have sky high antibody levels. And that's what I'm seeing. And that is alarming. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3241.7599999999998s)]
*  It just suggests that there is a lot of spike protein still in the body causing problems. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3247.68s)]
*  And haven't they shown that the spike protein continues to be produced in the body up to 700 [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3255.2s)]
*  days later? Yes. I mean, that's one study. What's interesting in that study that [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3259.92s)]
*  antibody levels were really low, which doesn't make sense. So I kind of questioned the whole study, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3267.28s)]
*  but yeah, I mean, I see it. I mean, I still see vaccine injured patients coming to me for the [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3272.56s)]
*  first time years later. Last week, I probably saw six new vaccine injured patients and they're not [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3279.76s)]
*  getting any help. The government, it's called the CICP. That's a countermeasures injury compensation [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3289.04s)]
*  program. They're supposed to help these patients. They have denied 98% of people that have applied [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3297.04s)]
*  for assistance. They are on average, I think they've awarded 30 people, 30 of all the vaccine [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3301.52s)]
*  injured that have applied, 30 people. On average, the award is like $4,000 for these people. It's [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3309.2s)]
*  horrible. I mean, these people's lives are just destroyed. These are not easy things to treat. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3315.2s)]
*  It's not like I can give them an antibiotic and they're good to go and they're fine. I mean, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3321.04s)]
*  they're very challenging. We don't have a lot of guidance. I do see a lot of success with Iver [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3325.04s)]
*  mectin, but it's slow going. It's usually months of trying to help them. And the government really [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3331.04s)]
*  needs to help these people because there's a lot of people suffering and they're getting [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3339.68s)]
*  completely ignored. The other issues, we don't even have a code. So every disease has a numerical [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3344.72s)]
*  code and it's called an ICD-10 code. It's what they use to compensate people for, or the insurance [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3350.9599999999996s)]
*  companies use them, but also for tracking. So if you have, COVID has its own little code and you [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3357.9199999999996s)]
*  can just dial in the code and get all the numbers. They don't have a code for vaccine injury. They [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3364.08s)]
*  have a code for vaccine hesitancy, but they don't have a code for injury. So all these people are [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3369.04s)]
*  getting all these diagnoses, but there's no way to track them. It's a big problem. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3374.88s)]
*  How convenient. Well, I would imagine the real problem with paying people is you'd have to pay [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3379.52s)]
*  so many. We can just print the money. I don't know what the problem is. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3386.32s)]
*  I mean, what do you give them? What if you find out you have myocarditis and your life expectancy [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3392.48s)]
*  is greatly reduced and we know for a fact it came out of this vaccine? What do you give a person [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3398.0s)]
*  like that? Their life's wages? What wages that they would have potentially earned? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3402.96s)]
*  What if it's Katy Perry? Well, so be it. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3408.2400000000002s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like you've given them two billion dollars. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3410.88s)]
*  I don't care. What do you do? The vaccine companies can pay that money. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3413.84s)]
*  I know, but it's insane. The number of people that I personally know. What's very shocking to me is [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3417.28s)]
*  when I talk to people that are pro-vaccine, still pro-vaccine, and when I be very specific, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3423.44s)]
*  mRNA vaccine, still pro-COVID vaccine that will tell me they don't know anybody who was injured [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3428.96s)]
*  by it. I was like, how is that possible? How many people do you know? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3434.96s)]
*  I know a lot. I know two people on pacemakers. Two. And they're young people. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3439.44s)]
*  Everybody knows somebody. Yeah, I know a lot of people that got [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3444.88s)]
*  fucked up, including family members. I know a lot of people that got fucked up. And people that [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3448.16s)]
*  don't want to admit they got fucked up, all of a sudden they have this new cancer that's spreading [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3453.12s)]
*  rapidly. It's terrifying. I watched the Danny Jones podcast and you guys were trying to get [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3457.36s)]
*  Casey Means, Callie Means to talk about SV40. Well, my thing with Callie, I actually talked to [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3468.7200000000003s)]
*  him last night. He will not go on record to state the COVID shot should be pulled off the market. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3476.7200000000003s)]
*  That's the whole ma. He's the head of my- Do you think that's being political? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3482.56s)]
*  That's trying to appease too many people? What do you think that is? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3487.2799999999997s)]
*  I can't read their minds, but I think anybody with a big microphone who is in a position of power [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3489.68s)]
*  and who knows the truth is ethically obligated to speak the truth. That's how I see it. I'm not a [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3497.68s)]
*  politician. I keep hearing the word strategy, but there are people I see. I'm just faced with the [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3503.3599999999997s)]
*  carnage every day in my office. I can't ignore it and I don't understand why this is so difficult [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3511.04s)]
*  other than political, but it shouldn't be political. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3518.08s)]
*  It shouldn't be. Right. That's what's disappointing because we thought that this [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3522.08s)]
*  administration come in and it was just going to kick down doors. Like this is it. Epstein list, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3525.36s)]
*  day one, who killed JFK? Let's find out. What are all these fucking UFOs? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3529.84s)]
*  That was not my priority list, but yeah. I'm mine. I'm a dummy. That was my number [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3536.48s)]
*  one. Out of those three, give me that one. Tell me the aliens are real. This political dance, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3540.88s)]
*  this excuse for that. I really appreciated Jack Cruz pestering him on that. Then I've talked to [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3550.6400000000003s)]
*  Brett Weinstein about that as well. He gave a breakdown of how it actually happened and when [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3558.32s)]
*  the original kidney cells from these monkeys were being used to make vaccines, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3566.64s)]
*  that they inadvertently gave these people this simianvirus-40, which when it gets into the [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3573.6s)]
*  human body can lead to rapid cancer. Right. Well, yeah, that's one of the cancer causing [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3579.7599999999998s)]
*  issues with these shots. It's not the only one though. It goes into the cell. It's supposed to [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3584.96s)]
*  not get into the nucleus, but it could get in the nucleus. We know that it can get into the nucleus [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3590.8799999999997s)]
*  and then if it gets in the nucleus. Well, at first they thought it was going to stay local. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3596.0s)]
*  Right. It's only going to stay in the arm. It's going to stay right where your arm is. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3599.04s)]
*  Your body will react to it. It will produce the antibodies and then you're good to go. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3602.16s)]
*  Then all these silly people, you can watch them die in the streets and laugh as you step over them. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3606.16s)]
*  Ha ha ha. I was smart. I trusted the science. Yeah. Yeah. So they know that that's not true. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3610.24s)]
*  It doesn't stay local. They know it doesn't dissipate within, it was a small amount of time [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3619.04s)]
*  that it was supposed to stay inside your body. They know that's not true. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3623.2s)]
*  Right. So yeah, they have, they replaced one of the nucleotides with something that's hard to [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3626.8799999999997s)]
*  break down, pseudo-uridine. They've never shown that pseudo-uridine is cleared from the body. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3632.3199999999997s)]
*  There's no study showing that we can clear it. So that could be why these people have these sky high [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3637.52s)]
*  antibody levels four years later, because the body might not be able to break it down. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3642.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. Oh my God. That's terrifying. What could you conceive of that would help something [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3647.76s)]
*  like that? Like what could you do that would aid the body in being able to do something like that? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3656.48s)]
*  Is there anything theorized? Yeah. I don't know. I wish, you know, Robert [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3660.7200000000003s)]
*  Malone would be a good person to ask maybe. Yeah. Yeah, maybe something like- [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3664.48s)]
*  He should come back on and do a victory lap anyway. That guy was torn apart. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3668.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. They were trying so hard to make him out to seem to be a kook. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3673.0400000000004s)]
*  And every interview he would do, he would be so reasonable, so logical, so fact-based, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3676.72s)]
*  and so knowledgeable. And they still, they still, he was a kook. He was a kook. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3682.3999999999996s)]
*  I remember some fucking guy yelled at me in Vegas. He said something about me spreading [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3687.8399999999997s)]
*  disinformation. Then he said something about that idiot Malone. I'm like, oh, that guy. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3694.56s)]
*  The inventor of mRNA. Or one of them. I don't know. I'm sure [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3699.3599999999997s)]
*  it's not like none of those things ever happened in a vacuum. I'm sure there's a ton of people [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3705.2s)]
*  working on that. But he was one of them. He's a fucking brilliant guy. But so how did they find [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3709.12s)]
*  out that it can get into the nucleus? Well, if you look at lipid nanoparticles, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3715.9199999999996s)]
*  and that's sort of the, that's what, otherwise, if you just put mRNA into the body without the [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3723.4399999999996s)]
*  lipid nanoparticle, it would get destroyed. So they put it in the shell, the lipid nanoparticle, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3728.3999999999996s)]
*  and there are studies showing lipid nanoparticles can cross the nuclear membrane. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3735.12s)]
*  So there's that. Kevin McKernan is a scientist. He's on X a lot. He's done a lot of work in that, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3739.84s)]
*  showing DNA contamination that's getting into these shots, in addition to the SV40. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3748.72s)]
*  DNA contamination. Right. So there's, and this was what [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3758.48s)]
*  Joe Latipo, the Surgeon General of Florida, he has actually called for the COVID shots to be [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3763.2s)]
*  pulled off the market. And his main argument was there is a certain amount of DNA that is allowed [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3766.88s)]
*  in any kind of these products. And we have proof that they have exceeded that threshold. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3773.68s)]
*  So there have been studies showing that there's excess DNA in these samples, which shouldn't be [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3780.56s)]
*  there. And that's just sort of this hard line that shouldn't be crossed. Where is this DNA [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3786.0s)]
*  coming from? In the production process, I guess. But it's pretty cut and dry. I think that's why [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3790.08s)]
*  Dr. Latipo has chosen this argument to go by, because there's just like a hard line that you [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3799.2s)]
*  don't cross, and they have crossed that. And what happens if you get too much DNA? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3804.96s)]
*  Well, you can integrate it. The concern is, does it integrate into your cell DNA? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3809.36s)]
*  Are we going to make monkey people? No, cancer. But cancer, that's... [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3815.68s)]
*  Right. You imagine if we made like hybrid people, they turn out to look like Neanderthals. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3822.0s)]
*  Like we injected them with something that twisted their genes back. But just the idea of [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3826.72s)]
*  manipulating your DNA is so terrifying. It's like, what? In pregnant women, right? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3831.6s)]
*  Right. Integrating. One thing if it's a 70-year-old man, but a pregnant woman... [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3836.0s)]
*  You hear that term? Integrate DNA. You don't think good things. That's like immediately, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3840.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, what? And these things are technically [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3845.5200000000004s)]
*  gene therapy products. They're not vaccines. Which is a real problem with using the same term. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3847.84s)]
*  Why not use a new term? Well, because then you wouldn't be under the umbrella of protection [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3853.36s)]
*  that vaccines currently enjoy, where they can't be. Which is so crazy. It's so crazy. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3860.6400000000003s)]
*  It's just hard to believe it's true. It really is. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3867.12s)]
*  It is. And so for a person like you that just like you were saying, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3870.3199999999997s)]
*  see the carnage every day, tell me what it's been like. What is it like? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3872.56s)]
*  It's hard because as an ENT, I'm used to fixing people quickly. So I get somebody with a science [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3876.16s)]
*  infection, get them the antibiotic, they're good to go. I got somebody with an abscess, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3884.3199999999997s)]
*  I drain the abscess, they're good to go. It's sort of why I chose my specialty, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3889.12s)]
*  because I like to see the results quickly. I didn't go into primary care for a reason. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3894.16s)]
*  And so when I see the injured, it's very slow growing, slow going. We don't have a lot of [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3900.16s)]
*  research. It's trial and error. These people were previously young and healthy and their lives have [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3905.92s)]
*  just been completely destroyed. I don't have a big support system of other specialists I can send [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3913.68s)]
*  them to. It's hard. I mean, I don't feel sorry for myself, but I'm just saying it's just very [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3919.52s)]
*  different from what I'm used to as a doctor. So I really hope that the government will step up [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3924.64s)]
*  and do something about this. Yeah, that would be a nice thing to hope to do something about it. But [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3931.6s)]
*  it would be really nice if some real research was done on what are the actual long-term effects. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3938.08s)]
*  If everyone's looking at it from a position of we can't get sued for this, this is dangerous, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3944.32s)]
*  someone has to look at it and say, well, these are the definite effects of this vaccine. Because [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3953.84s)]
*  this is long COVID, it's too much, oh, he got a neurological condition that was going to happen [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3960.88s)]
*  anyway. It just coincidentally happened after he took the COVID shot. There's got to be some way [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3965.84s)]
*  to determine what of these ailments, specifically when you're talking about the abnormal antibody [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3971.44s)]
*  levels. Well, there are patterns. I mean, I definitely see the same sort of things over [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3977.12s)]
*  and over again. So it's not like, you know. But as you said, it doesn't have a classification. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3982.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. It doesn't have a code. So we need an ICD-10 code for these. That seems kind of crazy. Yeah. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3986.16s)]
*  Well, imagine if that was the case with herpes. Everybody would be like, hey, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3991.12s)]
*  yeah, put a damn code in there so we know what this is. Right. But there, you know, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=3995.44s)]
*  I see very similar constellation of symptoms. I see patients with these abnormal tremors, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4000.4s)]
*  which, you know, they can't stop shaking even when they're sleeping. They feel internal vibrations [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4005.8399999999997s)]
*  or they'll have severe pain that you can't explain. You know, you get an MRI, there's nothing, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4012.4s)]
*  there's no nerve damage that you can tell. I've seen some very strange rashes and normally, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4017.7599999999998s)]
*  it doesn't matter what kind of rash it is. You throw a few meds at it and it will disappear. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4024.6400000000003s)]
*  But actually, the only thing that I've found helpful is ivermectin for these strange rashes. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4029.44s)]
*  And you see pots where the blood pressure, that's the hardest, I think. And this is, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4034.8s)]
*  we're seeing a lot of this, where the blood pressure just drops suddenly with no stimulation [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4040.56s)]
*  or the heart races with no provocation. That is very common and very difficult to treat. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4046.7200000000003s)]
*  That's a good friend of mine. Yeah. He says every now and then his heart will just jack up to like [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4053.04s)]
*  180. Yep. And he has to sit down and he just has to hope that this isn't the last time he breathes. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4057.52s)]
*  Yeah. He just sits there. He has a heart monitor. He puts it, you know, like one of the wristwatch [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4062.96s)]
*  ones, the Garmin one, he just watches his heart jack up to like 180 beats per minute, just sitting [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4067.36s)]
*  there for no reason, not knowing if you're going to die. Another friend of mine who was really young [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4073.2s)]
*  was a soccer player, super healthy guy, super fit, gets the vaccine all of a sudden, giant heart [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4078.0s)]
*  racing in the middle of the night, like out of control, like you're running a seven minute mile, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4084.8s)]
*  just jacked. And he wound up in the hospital twice. Nothing they could do. It all went away. It stopped. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4090.16s)]
*  It went back to normal after a while. But now he's got this like terrible fear that he's got a fucking [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4096.48s)]
*  time bomb in his chest that out of nowhere his heart would just ramp up. And you could say like, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4100.88s)]
*  it's probably a genetic thing. You probably had it already. It was like, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4107.44s)]
*  maybe. But this guy was super fit, super fit soccer player. And that's the athletes. So it used to be [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4111.04s)]
*  29 per year, now it's 290 per year, growth 10 times. It's crazy. Dropping dead. The rarest of rare [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4119.28s)]
*  people to drop dead in the middle of nowhere. The best athletes in the world. The people are [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4128.639999999999s)]
*  the healthiest in the prime of their life. Right. And I worry about these kids because, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4133.6s)]
*  you know, myocarditis, the primary symptom is chest pain. But if you've got a kid who's not [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4139.280000000001s)]
*  even speaking yet, you have no idea if they have myocarditis. And myocarditis can leave a permanent [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4144.64s)]
*  scar on the heart and then lead to a lifelong increased risk of sudden cardiac death. And [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4150.4800000000005s)]
*  we have no idea if these kids have been affected. Yeah. And how many kids do we see dropped out of [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4158.24s)]
*  heart attacks in like high school football this year? Like over the last stuff, four years rather. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4164.96s)]
*  It was like you'd see these articles pop up all the time. You never saw those articles. Or if you [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4170.4800000000005s)]
*  did, it was super rare. And it's some kid with a heart condition that was never diagnosed, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4174.56s)]
*  which does happen. Yeah. And the schools are now making kids get cleared by a doctor before doing [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4178.88s)]
*  sports, which I don't remember that when we were kids. Yeah. They just threw us right onto the [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4183.92s)]
*  wrestling team. They didn't check shit. They didn't even see if you had a cold. Yeah. I mean, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4188.16s)]
*  I don't know what's better. It's probably better to screen them. They'll find those undiagnosed [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4193.76s)]
*  conditions that kids can have. Well, I just think that I think it's in response to what's happened. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4198.16s)]
*  Oh, it certainly is. But I mean, that might be the good aspect of it. Maybe some people will [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4203.68s)]
*  get diagnosed that didn't have any idea that they were running around with the problem and they can [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4207.52s)]
*  fix it. It's hard to diagnose. Like really the only way you can diagnose myocarditis for sure [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4211.44s)]
*  is to do either a biopsy or a cardiac MRI, which is, you know, most kids are not going to be put [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4216.5599999999995s)]
*  through that. Right. So it's scary. And what's crazy is this is all true. And yet us talking [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4222.4s)]
*  about it makes us both look like kooks. Like we then will be labeled for sure someone will go out [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4232.24s)]
*  and attack us now and label us anti-vax, anti-science kooks. And this is what's dangerous [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4238.64s)]
*  about this conversation. This is what's dangerous about what they said. And, you know, those people [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4244.88s)]
*  work for the devil. Well, do you think you'll get censored on YouTube this interview? No, you don't. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4250.0s)]
*  No, I was just on Jimmy Dore. Yeah. And then bleep out like a full sentence of mine. I'm not [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4255.52s)]
*  bleeping out shit. I'm not bleeping out shit. You think it'll be okay? We'll find out. I think it's [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4261.68s)]
*  wrong if it's not okay. If it's not okay. I think YouTube is more reasonable now than they were [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4267.52s)]
*  during the pandemic. And I think they have a very difficult job managing content at scale where [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4272.400000000001s)]
*  you're dealing with, you know, the amount of people uploading things is insanity. And they have certain [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4281.200000000001s)]
*  things that they've tagged as being controversial, because they were anti-science or misinformation [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4288.64s)]
*  that it's still there's like lingering ones. What was the issue that we had, Jamie? We had like an [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4294.64s)]
*  old episode where there was something in the old episode that would have violated their rules back [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4299.4400000000005s)]
*  then. It doesn't violate them now. But we because the episode was uploaded back then, what happened [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4305.04s)]
*  with that? I had like a weird at the time, the penalty was like, you had to do something. And [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4311.4400000000005s)]
*  so like they couldn't take that step away. That was kind of the issue. But the bottom line was [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4318.88s)]
*  everything this person said was true. And proven to be true now. And now it's 100% fact. So now you [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4324.64s)]
*  can say whatever you want. Like now if you say, hey, you know, super likely that that virus leaked [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4329.76s)]
*  from a lab in China. And now you can say that like back then you would get attacked. It would be crazy [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4334.320000000001s)]
*  to be called a racist. You'd be called the worst things possible if you just said, like the wonderful [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4340.72s)]
*  Jon Stewart bit that he did on Colbert show. Did you ever see that bit? I can't remember. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4346.56s)]
*  You want to see it? Let's watch it because it's really hilarious. This is like in the heart of the [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4353.12s)]
*  pandemic. You know, and Stephen Colbert was like vaccine or death. You know, he was all in on it. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4358.0s)]
*  And so Colbert was like trying to like halt him in the middle. He's doing a bit. Jon Stewart's [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4363.68s)]
*  doing a bit. He's doing a funny bit. And Colbert tries to like cock block it. He tries to like [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4368.400000000001s)]
*  trip him. But Jon Stewart powers through like like the comic that he is. You find it? Don't tell me [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4373.68s)]
*  it was taken down. All right. Give us this one. All right. This is it. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4380.16s)]
*  I and I honestly mean this. I think we owe a great debt of gratitude [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4390.48s)]
*  to science. Science has in many ways helped ease the suffering of this pandemic, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4397.44s)]
*  uh, which was more than likely caused by science. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4406.08s)]
*  So and that's kind of. What was that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4415.84s)]
*  No, listen, listen, it's coffee. I would do that too. I wouldn't do that to you. I'm all for [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4423.4400000000005s)]
*  spit takes. But what do you mean by that? Do you mean like perhaps there's a chance that [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4428.160000000001s)]
*  this was created in a lab? There's an investigation, a chance. Well, I don't, I, I, I, I, I, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4432.88s)]
*  oh my God evidence. I'd love to hear. There's a novel respiratory coronavirus overtaking [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4437.4400000000005s)]
*  Wuhan China. What do we do? Oh, you know who we could ask the Wuhan novel respiratory coronavirus [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4443.6s)]
*  lab. The disease is the same name as the lab. That's just, that's just a little too weird. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4451.4400000000005s)]
*  Don't you think? And then they asked the scientists, they're like, how did this? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4459.04s)]
*  So wait a minute. You work at the Wuhan respiratory coronavirus lab. How did this happen? And they're [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4462.08s)]
*  like, a pangolin kiss the turtle. And you're like, no, I, you, you, the name of your lab. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4467.5199999999995s)]
*  If you look at the name, look at the name, can I, let me see your business card. Show me your [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4475.5199999999995s)]
*  business card. Oh, I work at the coronavirus lab in Wuhan. Oh, because there's a coronavirus loose [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4481.52s)]
*  in Wuhan. How did that happen? Maybe a bat flew into the cloaca of a turkey and then it sneezed [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4490.64s)]
*  into my chili. And now we all have coronavirus. Like, okay, okay, okay. Wait a second. Wait a [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4501.4400000000005s)]
*  second. What about this? What about this? Wait a second. Wait a second. All right. Oh my God. Oh my God. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4507.04s)]
*  There's been an outbreak of chocolatey goodness near Hershey, Pennsylvania. What do you think [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4514.24s)]
*  happened? Like, oh, I don't know. Maybe a steam shovel made it with a cocoa bean or it's the [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4520.24s)]
*  chocolate factory. Maybe that's it. That could be. That could be. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4528.32s)]
*  Kober kept trying to get in the way. That could be. By the way, I gave them all tuberculosis. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4537.6s)]
*  That could, that could very well be. And Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins at NIH said like, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4544.88s)]
*  it should definitely be investigated. Stop with the logic and people and things. The name of the [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4549.68s)]
*  disease. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. But I, it could be possible. You could [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4555.5199999999995s)]
*  be right. It could be possible that they have the lab in Wuhan to study the novel coronavirus [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4561.44s)]
*  diseases because in Wuhan there are a lot of novel coronavirus diseases because of the bat population [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4568.5599999999995s)]
*  there. I understand. It's like the saying, like, wait a second. It's a local specialty and it's the only place to find bats. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4576.24s)]
*  You won't find bats. No, but it's like saying why. Oh wait. Austin, Texas has thousands of them that fly out of a cave [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4580.879999999999s)]
*  every night, every night at dusk. Is there a coronavirus in Austin coronavirus? No, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4587.52s)]
*  it doesn't seem to be in Austin coronavirus. The only coronavirus we have is in Wuhan, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4593.4400000000005s)]
*  where they have a lab called, what's the lab called again, Stephen? The Wuhan novel coronavirus lab. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4601.120000000001s)]
*  I believe that's the case. And how long have you worked for Senator Ron Johnson? Let me tell you [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4607.4400000000005s)]
*  something. This is not a conspiracy. Here's the thing about science. You could be right. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4612.08s)]
*  Here's, you could be right. But this is the problem with science. Science is incredible. This is it. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4620.88s)]
*  They don't know when to stop and nobody in the room with those cats. He's going to do the other thing [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4625.44s)]
*  that we already saw. Yeah. The other thing we talked about the Spanish flu, which a lot of people [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4629.92s)]
*  never heard that before either. They did what? Isn't that great? That's one of the best segments ever [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4633.92s)]
*  on late night television ever in the history. Emperor wears no clothes and [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4639.84s)]
*  Colbert thinks the emperor still has a fancy robe on. Well, this is the job of comedians in society [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4645.76s)]
*  at certain times. And John Stewart, he held the torch. I didn't realize he was enlightened. Well, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4652.08s)]
*  he's a very smart guy. He's just, he's not a bullshitter. You know, he's a very smart guy. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4658.16s)]
*  I don't agree with him on everything. But has he come around on the shot? I don't know. I don't [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4663.52s)]
*  know. I haven't spoken to him. He lives in another state, but I love the guy. He's great. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4668.959999999999s)]
*  And he's, he was my favorite comedian. Like when I was younger, he's a great comic, very funny guy [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4674.879999999999s)]
*  and a very nice guy and very fair and honest. He's, he's a, you know, like the type of person [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4680.639999999999s)]
*  who could do that on television in the middle of the shit, which is what it was. This was like [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4688.24s)]
*  right around the same time where the government was, where they made that, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4694.0s)]
*  remember that release that they had, they said for the vaccinated, you've done your job, but for the [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4697.84s)]
*  unvaccinated, you're looking forward to a winter of illness and death, severe illness and death, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4702.64s)]
*  severe, it's crazy, severe illness and death. And this was during Omnicron, which statistically was [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4710.4s)]
*  a cold. That was the one that was like the, had the least mortality. So for him to do that, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4716.8s)]
*  during that time was very courageous. Like he had to know, like, but he just had to make it [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4724.0s)]
*  really funny, which he did. He just, he knew it's so preposterous because it's so on the nose. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4729.36s)]
*  You almost think like if that was in a movie, like that would be too good. Like it was a Cohen [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4734.8s)]
*  Brothers movie or something like, Oh my God, this movie is ridiculous. Like there's no way it would [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4738.8s)]
*  be named the same as the lab. Did he get smeared for it? I don't think he did. No, John skirted [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4742.56s)]
*  out of that. He had a show with Apple for a while and it was really good. But then I think, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4748.56s)]
*  I don't want to speak at a turn here, but I do all the time. So I might as well. I think there was an [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4755.280000000001s)]
*  issue with an episode they did on China. Is that the case? See if there's like data on that, or if [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4760.160000000001s)]
*  there's a story on that, but they stopped doing that show. So you had like a Apple show, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4764.88s)]
*  you know, cause Apple TV produces a lot of shows now they have severance. You ever watch severance? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4772.72s)]
*  No, I'm watching righteous gemstones now. Oh my God. That's a good show. Oh my God. That's, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4777.76s)]
*  that is such a funny show. I didn't even hear about it until like this year. There's almost [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4783.2s)]
*  too many great shows. It's hard to keep up. That show is fantastic. That show is so fun. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4788.08s)]
*  I think it's modeled after Joel Osteen. Is it really? That's my theory. And I, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4793.44s)]
*  I pass by his church every day. So yeah, there's something about those guys, those guys that run [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4798.48s)]
*  the mega churches. Like you gotta be crazy. Like not one of them is like, Oh, that guy makes sense. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4805.28s)]
*  Super reasonable, normal human being. That's like, I like that guy. I want him as my pastor. No, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4813.84s)]
*  it's always like some complete kook. In October, the New York times reported that Apple canceled [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4819.84s)]
*  the comedy show ahead of its third season due to creative differences and execs concerns over [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4824.5599999999995s)]
*  Stewart's coverage of topics such as China and AI. Okay. The China, I get it. Apple has contracts [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4829.44s)]
*  with China, right? They have cell phones made in China and they're, they actually have to, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4838.24s)]
*  we were did a story about that the other day. We were talking, read a story rather the other day [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4843.36s)]
*  about how the iPhone 17 is so complex that it actually has to be manufactured in China [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4847.759999999999s)]
*  because they have the best manufacturing. So they must have some sort of a thing where you like, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4853.04s)]
*  you can't criticize, you know, fuck it all up for us. You're gonna fuck it all up for the production [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4857.52s)]
*  of our phones that we need to, we make all this money, which is why we have more money than most [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4862.240000000001s)]
*  countries. Well, I don't see how John Stewart would be a threat to their revenue. I just don't think [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4866.400000000001s)]
*  they want them criticizing, you know, China, but the AI one is even more weird. The AI one is even [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4871.68s)]
*  more weird because it's like, uh, don't you think we should make fun of AI? Don't you think there [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4878.56s)]
*  should be like something that scares the shit out of people enough till they wake up and [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4883.84s)]
*  recognize that this thing is coming at us like a freight train. There's no guardrails. No one knows [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4888.24s)]
*  what's going to happen. And everybody's like full steam ahead. AI terrifies me. It should. It does. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4894.72s)]
*  What's cause you're intelligent. You know, I think most intelligent people are aware that this will [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4902.24s)]
*  be a change that is akin to the asteroid that hit the Yucatan. This is gonna, this is gonna hit [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4908.08s)]
*  in some crazy way that like redefines what it means to be a human being. It's around the corner. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4915.68s)]
*  Well, yeah. And you know, Texas, they love AI. They're like put a huge amount of money into AI. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4921.92s)]
*  Oh, fun. Oh, fun. Yeah. I know you love Texas, but I, it is not, it is not what [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4928.72s)]
*  you think. No, there's a lot of things. I need to wake you up on Texas. Well, I like the fact that [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4938.0s)]
*  it was free during the time where California was not. You could do whatever you wanted to. Relatively. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4942.8s)]
*  Relatively. Right. But in my business and for what I do, like stand up comedy and letting people tell [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4947.92s)]
*  you what you can and can't do, I don't like that. Right. You know, and here they've had a more [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4954.48s)]
*  rebellious spirit in that regard. So I think healthcare though is turning Texas blue. Yeah. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4959.36s)]
*  We have, like Houston is home to the largest medical center in the world [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4966.0s)]
*  and it brings in people from all over. And I think mandates started in Texas for a reason. I think [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4970.16s)]
*  they did it here to test the waters. They knew if they could get, get away with it in Texas, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4976.08s)]
*  they could get away with it anywhere. Oh, don't make me move to Florida. No, I don't even think. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4982.0s)]
*  Don't make me. I know. I think Idaho. Florida's not any good either. Idaho's cold as fuck. Jamie [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4986.24s)]
*  can't live. Look at him over there. He can't survive. He got out of Ohio and he developed thin [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4990.64s)]
*  blood. But yeah, Texas, I just, I think it's a, we had, so Texas Medical Association, largest [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=4995.04s)]
*  medical association in the country. They are really proponents of transgender surgery and minors. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5006.48s)]
*  They are anti-free speech for physicians. They are, they are pro-mandate. They've gone after me. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5015.28s)]
*  And they have a tight control over the people in our house and state. So I just think we need to [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5021.5199999999995s)]
*  be careful. I mean, you saw it during the pandemic and the medical, the economy of our state is, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5029.92s)]
*  is dominated by health and people don't realize that they just think oil. But health is a huge [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5039.759999999999s)]
*  dominating factor in our economy. And, you know, you saw what they did to me, what they're still [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5046.4s)]
*  doing to me. You see the mandates and you, I don't know if you've been following what's going on in [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5051.839999999999s)]
*  in the house, but the house is, our house is divided. So we've got the, the freedom, the real [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5058.4s)]
*  true freedom loving representatives. And then we have these pseudo Republicans who, who do control [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5065.2s)]
*  everything. But they are basically Democrats in disguise. And I don't know, it really worries me. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5072.56s)]
*  Idaho just passed a bill, the best medical freedom bill in the country. It eliminates all medical [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5081.360000000001s)]
*  mandates except for hospitals, of course. Cause, but it's the first one of its kind where medical [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5088.96s)]
*  mandates are finally outlawed. Because I mean, you think about it, all these vaccines that we [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5096.64s)]
*  have to give our kids to go to school is actually fundamentally wrong. We should not mandate any [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5102.4s)]
*  child to get a shot to go to school. And, and Europe, half the countries don't have those kind [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5108.0s)]
*  of mandates, but the United States is very common. You know, all kids have to get these shots to go [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5113.5199999999995s)]
*  to school. And if you opt out, it's a big deal. And some States don't even allow it, don't even [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5118.48s)]
*  allow exemptions. So I think it's a wake up call. Like I just, I never thought about the whole, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5123.44s)]
*  the fact that I had to give my kids these shots to go to school as being an issue. But now that [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5129.76s)]
*  COVID happened, I see it as a huge issue. But Florida, you know, Florida's been kind of behind [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5133.2s)]
*  it too. Like, you know, they're not one of the States trying to get ivermectin over the counter. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5139.2s)]
*  There were nine States that tried to pass bills banning mRNA. They all failed, but Florida wasn't [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5144.400000000001s)]
*  one of those. So Florida worries me too. Idaho, Idaho, Idaho. They have good skiing there. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5151.2s)]
*  I don't ski. I quit skiing a few years back, my last accident. I'm like, I'm done. Ski, I love skiing. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5159.76s)]
*  Oh, it's fun. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Didn't get hurt. Don't get hurt. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5168.08s)]
*  That's how I feel every time I ski. But I've had a bunch of surgeries. That's a problem. Like I know [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5172.08s)]
*  the vulnerability of knees. I've had three knee surgeries. It's like, it's, it's rough on you, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5176.24s)]
*  you know, but it's fun. Wee. It's just for me, like the juice isn't worth the squeeze. There's a bunch [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5183.280000000001s)]
*  of other stuff that's a lot more fun that doesn't come with risk of broken bones and concussions. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5189.04s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. I like roller coasters for fun. I can't. You're one of those. I'm not, no, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5193.92s)]
*  I'm not full on, but I don't know. Have you, have the new roller coasters, have you been on them [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5200.24s)]
*  recently? Oh yeah. I have kids. Yeah. They're much better. I mean, they're not what the ones we grew [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5205.5199999999995s)]
*  up with. No, some of the ones like Disneyland has some insane ones. The one, the Incredibles ride, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5209.92s)]
*  if you've done that one. Whoa. I like guardians of the galaxy. Oh, that's great. I love that. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5215.36s)]

*  incredible? Florida or California? Florida. Oh yeah. I think I did that. I think it's called [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5230.96s)]
*  flights of fantasy or something like that. It's incredible. Like you, you are one of the avatar [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5235.44s)]
*  people and you fly around on a dragon and it's so good. It's so good. It just like, you feel the [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5239.92s)]
*  breeze, you feel mist in the air at a certain point. I'm realizing while I'm doing this, I'm like, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5246.24s)]
*  this wasn't even remotely possible just 20 years ago. Like, what is it going to look like 20 years [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5251.92s)]
*  from now? Like, I'm not going to have any idea. They're going to put a helmet on me. It's going [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5257.28s)]
*  to like sync up with my brain. Ready? Brain sync. And all of a sudden you're going to be in that [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5261.36s)]

*  that's 100% coming. Yeah. I'm, I'm happy with the roller coaster. I'll stick with that. It's not [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5270.72s)]
*  worth it. It's not as good. You take the brain thing, get in the avatar world. I get sick on [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5276.72s)]
*  those rides. The ones where the 3D, I get kind of nauseated. This one moves too. This one, you're on [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5283.44s)]
*  like a motorcycle, like a fake motorcycle and that's to represent the dragon, you know, and you have [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5288.32s)]
*  like a handle you hold onto and it starts moving you around. So like as you're flying, it's like, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5293.36s)]
*  it's a full sensory experience. I think I did that. My kids made fun of me because I was [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5298.0s)]
*  screaming on it. Yeah. A couple of years ago. Yeah. It's so good. Such a good ride. And that's just [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5303.2s)]
*  the tip of the iceberg. And when you connect that to AI, so it tailors something that's specific [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5310.48s)]
*  for your whatever crazy fantasy you want to do. We already have video games where people can murder [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5316.0s)]
*  people. Like that's like the most popular video game is Grand Theft Auto. And one of the things [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5320.88s)]
*  that people love about it is you could just beat some mechanics of death for no reason. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5325.36s)]
*  Do you think that allows people to get out their frustrations though in a healthier way? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5329.76s)]
*  Perhaps. I would recommend martial arts. I think that would be a healthier way. But I think more [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5335.52s)]
*  than anything, what it does is allows you to disassociate and just to be able to, because it [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5340.56s)]
*  doesn't mean anything. It's not really a person that's getting beat to death, but the imagery is [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5345.4400000000005s)]
*  obviously of a person that's getting beat to death and you're able to do it with no consequences, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5349.12s)]
*  no recourse, no bad karma. You don't even feel bad because it's a part of the game. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5353.04s)]
*  You know, there was, what was that one where you could drag the wild west one, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5357.2s)]
*  where you could beat people with whips. Red Dawn Redemption. Red Dead Redemption. Crazy games where [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5362.08s)]
*  you could do horrible things to people. Like what is it going to be like when you have video games [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5370.32s)]
*  that are actually virtual reality, completely immersive and you could just be a serial killer. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5374.88s)]
*  You could be Jack the Ripper. They give you a knife and now you're in London in the 1800s and [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5378.56s)]
*  you're Jack the Ripper. Why do people create these? Because they can, right? It's like what [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5384.080000000001s)]
*  John Stewart said about the nuclear bomb. Like why they do that? Well, and this is the same thing. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5389.68s)]
*  This is the parallel to the Manhattan Project because we're not the only ones that are trying [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5394.160000000001s)]
*  to find the, get to the solution of what is like the ultimate expression of AI in its current form, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5398.080000000001s)]
*  like super intelligent, sentient, artificial intelligence, like something that's going to be [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5405.2s)]
*  godlike power and ability. China's working on it too. We have to work on it. If we don't work, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5411.5199999999995s)]
*  like, so everyone's like, hang on. We're like, nope, choo choo. Just China's working on it. We [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5417.12s)]
*  have to do it. We have to get there first. So this is, it's just like the Manhattan Project. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5421.84s)]
*  And I don't think it's going to matter. I think, I think once we get there, it's going to be so [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5425.44s)]
*  weird for everybody. It's, I think civilization is going to be an upheaval. And I think we're [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5430.56s)]
*  entirely attached to the idea that this civilization that we live under, where our money is all in [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5436.080000000001s)]
*  hard drives and it's all ones and zeros on a database somewhere, not even backed up by [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5442.96s)]
*  gold anymore. It's all super weird already. Like this is standard forever. I don't think it is. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5447.76s)]
*  I don't know. I feel like there may be a backlash because, you know, there's this, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5453.92s)]
*  this wanting to do real things and do, you know, real experiences. I mean, I, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5458.32s)]
*  yeah, there'll be a few hikers. There'll be a few hikers, few people. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5464.24s)]
*  When you're on your computer all day, the first thing I want to do is just get outside and, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5468.0s)]
*  and get away from all, all of that. And so my hope is that there's going to be a backlash. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5472.08s)]
*  Well, there'll be a few, right? There's just like, there's people that are still pro-vaccine today, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5476.88s)]
*  right? They're still pro mRNA vaccine. They will. I can't wait for the new booster. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5481.28s)]
*  There's people that are out there like that, right? You're always going to have different [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5485.12s)]
*  kinds of people. You're never going to have one thing where everybody adopts it. There's going [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5487.679999999999s)]
*  to be a bunch of people that want to live a subsistence lifestyle in the woods forever. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5490.8s)]
*  Let all those morons in New York put their helmets on and live in avatar land. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5494.639999999999s)]
*  I'm going to live out here in the real world. But if you think about how many people play games today [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5499.5199999999995s)]
*  versus how many people played games 30 years ago, it's off the charts, right? Like what are the [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5504.24s)]
*  numbers? Like when I was a child is when they had pong. That was the first one. Do you remember [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5509.12s)]
*  that? Yeah, it was in the Sears store. Do you remember that? You go shopping for jeans and [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5514.16s)]
*  you play the game. That's where you buy your tools. Yeah. Yeah. And that was revolutionary. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5518.5599999999995s)]
*  You could play a game on television and it was a really simple game, you know, and you'd be playing [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5526.4s)]
*  ping pong with this like slow moving ping pong ball. And it was fun. And we all loved it. Family [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5531.92s)]
*  gather around play ping pong. And then you fast forward to call of duty. Like that's insane. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5535.84s)]
*  Like that is insane. These kids are they have microphones on. They're talking. They're running [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5542.96s)]
*  through Fallujah, gunning people down like this is crazy. So the numbers went through that phase, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5547.6s)]
*  but they seem now to be sort of disinterested. Like they kind of did a good job. Well, I didn't [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5554.4800000000005s)]
*  do anything. It just happened. I think a lot of kids are disinterested because they realized that [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5560.08s)]
*  the beck and call of life and becoming a success is you cannot get too wrapped up in these things [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5565.36s)]
*  because they will steal your time. And but my point is that the amount of people that are allowing [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5571.36s)]
*  it to steal their time today, and I know you're enjoying it, steal your time. Like have fun, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5576.32s)]
*  play your games. I love them. They're fun, but I can't do them. There's too much. See, they're [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5580.639999999999s)]
*  too exciting. They're too good. But these are just the beginning. What we're experiencing now, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5585.44s)]
*  Call of Duty and first person shooters that everybody loves in comparison to what's going [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5591.12s)]
*  to happen when they put that thing on your head and then all of a sudden you really are on [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5595.12s)]
*  Battleship Troopers. Is that what was that movie where they fought the aliens Starship Troopers? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5599.599999999999s)]
*  Did you ever see that one? No, great movie, but it's the future or, you know, they're fighting [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5605.28s)]
*  off aliens, giant alien bugs. You could be in that. You could be in it. Feel the sand on your feet. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5609.76s)]
*  Feel the wind in your face. Smell the breath of the beast as you shoot it down. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5615.12s)]
*  It's going to be too compelling. Yeah. Either that or go work at the supermarket. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5620.96s)]
*  Near the supermarket all day. You want to play pickup basketball? Okay. You suck at basketball. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5625.84s)]
*  Keep hitting bricks. I think the answer is roller coasters. No, no, no, no. I don't know. I just [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5630.16s)]
*  think it's just it's a test of civilization and it's it's probably something that is changing [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5636.96s)]
*  our species and changing it really quickly before we even realize it. Like just like we turn changed [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5644.88s)]
*  wolves into dogs. It's turning us into technology dependent gelatinous water balloons of blood. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5651.68s)]
*  That's dark. It is dark. They're trying. I think they'll take over doctors. Yeah, they're gonna. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5661.52s)]
*  They're gonna take over lawyers, doctors. They're probably going to take over a lot of actors. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5666.64s)]
*  I think actors and even screenwriters are in real trouble. Wait, wait, wait. How do you take over an [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5671.839999999999s)]
*  actor? Because these AI videos now are insane. They're so good. Have you ever seen the one where [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5675.92s)]
*  there's stand-up comedians talking on stage about how and there's people out there that believe that [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5681.92s)]
*  we're a prompt like and then they're going to people in scenes of movies that are like [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5687.28s)]
*  saying do you really believe this is a prompt and there's Vikings like incredible Viking village [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5693.679999999999s)]
*  where you're like walking down the village. It's all AI and it looks like Hollywood movie quality. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5699.76s)]
*  It looks like some crazy new blockbuster that's out about Vikings. They have Cro-Magnum Man walk, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5706.400000000001s)]
*  you know, like like hunting on a raft moving through the frozen frozen lake. It's the whole [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5712.8s)]
*  thing is nuts. It's so good. It's so and it keeps getting better. Like this is insanely good compared [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5718.72s)]
*  to what just existed a couple of months ago like a year ago like there's you it's unrecognizable. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5725.36s)]
*  We could like computers move so slow in comparison like think about when did when [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5732.24s)]
*  do you first get your first computer? Probably medical school. What year was that? That was like [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5738.0s)]
*  1998. Okay, so you're probably running Windows 98, right? It kind of worked but it was a little buggy. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5745.2s)]
*  Sometimes it would crash you get the blue screen at death. Then within like five years they got [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5751.68s)]
*  way better. Ten years they got way better. But now if you look at it, if you have a laptop now [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5758.16s)]
*  in 2025 versus a laptop from 2020, no difference. I have an old MacBook that I use sometimes [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5762.96s)]
*  because I like it because clickier keyboards and it's fucking old as shit. It's really old. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5769.6s)]
*  Like it seems like a regular laptop. It's not that much different. The AI from then was nothing. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5774.64s)]
*  It didn't exist and now it's making movies that are off the charts. They're unbelievably realistic [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5780.96s)]
*  and this is just one version of it. They're going to have a way better version of it a month from [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5789.44s)]
*  now. A way better version of it six months from now. And where does that end? Like it doesn't. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5793.36s)]
*  It doesn't end and who knows what the news is now. You know how many times someone sent me [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5799.76s)]
*  something on Twitter and I thought wow that's crazy war footage and it turns out it was just [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5804.96s)]
*  from a video game. Wow. Yeah the people get duped. They see a plane getting shot down. They think [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5809.68s)]
*  it's real. Like wow. No it's just a scene in a video game. Yeah I haven't seen these videos. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5814.64s)]
*  Yeah I've seen photos that look very realistic. I haven't seen these videos. I'll have to go check [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5820.08s)]
*  that out. They're too good. They're too good and this race to AI is you know we're all involved in [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5825.04s)]
*  it and I worry that it's not in our best interest just like I worry that [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5834.64s)]
*  our health system is compromised. I worry about it all. I worry there's a lot of people that are [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5841.280000000001s)]
*  going to be insanely wealthy once this goes live. Like once this goes live the haves versus the [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5846.56s)]
*  have-nots will be so far separated. But how do you make money off of AI? You control everything. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5852.64s)]
*  First of all the stock market. You figure out the stock market immediately and bet insane amounts [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5859.52s)]
*  of wealth at things and compound it and figure out when to buy and when to sell instantaneously. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5866.16s)]
*  You could even use AI to manipulate markets by having a bunch of bots tweet about something. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5873.04s)]
*  So they need to jack up a stock price and then you would go in and clean up. You would create [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5879.4400000000005s)]
*  crypto coins, unlimited amounts of crypto coins, dump tons of money in it, hire celebrities they [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5884.48s)]
*  wouldn't even know, hire them to promote the crypto coin, pull the wool out from everybody, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5891.599999999999s)]
*  make billions of dollars. You just do that over and over and over and over again instantaneously [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5896.32s)]
*  all around the world. Then you have all the money. Like AI, if you're in control of AI and AI is [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5900.799999999999s)]
*  artificial super intelligence and you tell it make me as much money as you can [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5909.28s)]
*  as quickly as possible in the stock market. This is what we have. We have a hundred million dollars [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5916.48s)]
*  to invest. We have a billion dollars to invest. If you're already wealthy, if you're a huge company [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5921.599999999999s)]
*  already you could do something like that and who knows what kind of an effect that would have. You [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5925.679999999999s)]
*  could manipulate world governments instantaneously. You could cut off pipelines. You could sabotage [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5929.92s)]
*  power grids. You could shut down energy plants. You could do all kinds of things. You can insert [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5936.16s)]
*  viruses into systems that control every aspect of society instantaneously. You crack all especially [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5942.16s)]
*  once they figure out how to attach AI to quantum computing. Then we're doomed. Then we're really [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5951.76s)]
*  doomed because then you have any computational problems. You have insane amounts of computational [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5956.88s)]
*  power. It's all in our lifetime. That's what's nuts. This will be if people survive [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5961.2s)]
*  and there's a golden age thousands of years from now where they find the relics of this civilization [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5970.32s)]
*  and they go look through and they figure out how to open up hard drives and they see us having this [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5977.36s)]
*  conversation about it. It's going to be weird. It's going to be like oh they saw it coming. They did [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5982.48s)]
*  it anyway. Well how do we stop it? I think Elon Musk was sounding the alarm and he can't stop it. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5988.72s)]
*  Not only did he not stop it, he joined in. I think that's the idea is that you have to do it [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=5998.16s)]
*  because other people are doing it. If they get a hold of it first it'd be catastrophic. I'm sure [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6004.0s)]
*  I screwed up a lot of possibilities in that little stupid rant of mine but it's something I think [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6008.16s)]
*  people need to have in their head because this isn't something that's not going to affect you. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6014.88s)]
*  Oh that's not going to affect me. I don't really have to pay attention to the politics in Poland. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6019.2s)]
*  It's not going to affect me. You can do that. With this one you can't do it with because it's [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6023.4400000000005s)]
*  going to affect all of us. In the world you're not going to know what the news is. You think [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6028.08s)]
*  Rolling Stone fooled us with that stupid picture from Oklahoma with a bunch of people [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6034.32s)]
*  that are gunshot victims waiting in line? They should have used AI for their picture. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6038.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah right. That's a good point because that was only a couple of years ago. Today they probably [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6043.28s)]
*  would. But this is a clear lie and it's a bad one. What about the really good ones? The really [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6047.5199999999995s)]
*  well coordinated ones that are using artificial created images? How are we going to know? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6056.0s)]
*  When I google something I'm not going to go do clinical research. I'm not going to test these [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6064.32s)]
*  things to make sure it's correct myself. If you're in control of all the information on the [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6070.16s)]
*  internet you can instantaneously create a bunch of websites with fake data on it. You can do that [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6075.12s)]

*  bye. Everything's bye bye. All these little roadblocks that we kept up there to keep our [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6091.04s)]
*  feeble primate brains from cracking these codes. All that stuff goes away. It's going to get real [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6098.08s)]
*  weird. I don't have an answer. I don't either. We have to go get a bunker after this podcast. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6105.36s)]
*  I know. I don't think it's going to be that bad. But I do think it's going to be [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6113.68s)]
*  really... It's going to change just society as we know it. There's probably going to be a lot of [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6117.92s)]
*  good aspects of it too. I think the medical aspect of it is pretty amazing. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6124.4s)]
*  Chat GPT alone when you can put in your blood work and can give you some... [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6128.16s)]
*  Well, I put in an MRI that I had of my own and it missed it. Totally missed it. It was GROC. It [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6134.08s)]
*  was not Chat GPT. Which one's the best at that? I don't know. I don't like Chat GPT. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6142.799999999999s)]
*  There's some other really good ones too, right? All I use is GROC. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6151.2s)]
*  That's it? You're a hardcore rat winger. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6154.639999999999s)]
*  No, I'm not. Yes. I don't trust Chat. I don't trust GROC, but I certainly don't trust Chat GPT. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6157.44s)]
*  Well, I was listening to someone talk about a new program that is... They have Pegasus. So, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6164.959999999999s)]
*  Pegasus can read your phone. This new program is a zero click. It reads everything in your phone, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6171.12s)]
*  including your encrypted messages. You have no idea if you have it on there or not. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6177.76s)]
*  There's no way to detect it and it's been being used. It's used currently. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6183.12s)]
*  What's the name of it? I don't know, Jamie. See if you could [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6191.04s)]
*  find out the name of it. The old one was Pegasus. The new one is a similar preposterous name. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6195.280000000001s)]
*  Is it Palantir? I don't know. That's a different thing. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6202.88s)]
*  I think Ian Carroll was talking about it. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6206.4s)]
*  So, you don't have any privacy anymore. Then your text messages don't have any privacy. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6212.08s)]
*  I just assume I don't have any privacy anymore. If it wasn't for Elon Musk buying Twitter, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6215.599999999999s)]
*  can you imagine how weird the world would be right now? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6220.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's so fortunate. I was kicked off for five months. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6222.24s)]
*  What did you do that got you kicked off? I was kind of timid back then compared to [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6226.639999999999s)]
*  what I say now. I really wasn't that. But I had a tweet that went viral and it was [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6232.8s)]
*  America First Legal was suing the CDC over some email. I can't remember exactly, but it was [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6241.04s)]
*  something like America First Legal has just exposed the CDC in a way of viral. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6248.8s)]
*  And then that was my last tweet. I was erased for five months. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6255.12s)]
*  What excuse did they give you? I don't remember. Violating [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6258.88s)]
*  community standards. Wow. What did that feel like? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6262.96s)]
*  And then I got out and then I tried to get out truth and get her. It's just not the same, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6271.4400000000005s)]
*  right? You just don't get that feedback. You know what I think about those things too? [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6275.12s)]
*  And Gab as well. I think they're all infested with like state out of state actors, other countries, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6279.92s)]
*  other countries, intelligence agencies, and even our own countries. And then even corporations. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6287.52s)]
*  I think they're infected. I think even like Democratic and Republican operatives. I think [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6292.24s)]
*  a lot of the traffic is bots. Yeah. Well, I see that on Twitter, definitely. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6296.719999999999s)]
*  100%. It's almost not worth engaging anymore. It's like, what are we doing here? Like you're [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6300.96s)]
*  arguing with someone who's not even a real person. And I think that's like, that's a big part of it. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6305.92s)]
*  And I think in those other alternative platforms, like truth, I think they do that to make them [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6309.84s)]
*  ridiculous for everybody else. You know, so the last thing they want is a bunch of people to [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6316.08s)]
*  competing to see who's the freest. Right? Right. So what's the best way to do that? Well, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6321.6s)]
*  you have to sabotage this new social media platform. The moment it comes out, the moment [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6327.6s)]
*  it comes out swastikas, you know, peppy the frog, the worst possible things post as much as you can [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6332.08s)]
*  so that this place becomes toxic, you know, so that you have to have like a zero tolerance policy, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6338.96s)]
*  like blue sky does. You go to blue sky, if you tweet, there are only two genders, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6344.72s)]
*  banned, get the fuck out of here. I was on blue sky for a bit. How long? How long did you last? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6348.64s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, I got, I got a slid in before it was open to the public. And I started stirring [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6353.360000000001s)]
*  the pot. And then I just got, I got bored. I got in some fights with, um, who's that woman? [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6359.12s)]
*  She's a lawyer. She's a big vaccine enthusiast. Vaccine enthusiast is hilarious. Yeah, she's a [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6366.240000000001s)]
*  really good hockey. She's like the, she's like the female version of Hotez. Anyway, I just got [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6372.64s)]
*  Lina Wen. No, um, I can't remember. I know what she looks like, but I don't want to say it. I don't [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6378.56s)]
*  want to. No worries. You don't have to say it. So what was that like? Blue sky? Yeah. When you got [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6385.280000000001s)]
*  into it with her. I mean, whatever it's yeah, I've gotten so many fights on X. It's not really, it's [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6391.04s)]
*  a, it's a, it's just funny. I, you know, when, when, before Methodist went after me, I got in [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6397.36s)]
*  some fights on Facebook with these private groups and there are a bunch of women that get together, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6405.92s)]
*  the neighborhood women's group. Oh boy. Vicious. Oh boy. Barely vicious. And it was the Houston [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6410.639999999999s)]
*  women's physicians group and they, they called me Bertha and they like started, they were like, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6416.88s)]
*  Bertha? Yeah. Why Bertha? Because I got mad at them. I don't know. Why they call you Bertha? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6422.799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. They, they just, uh, they were like, we don't want you in our group. You should go [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6427.12s)]
*  find another group and you're spreading misinformation and yeah, things like that. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6431.2s)]
*  And there was a neighborhood group that went after me. Um, those are more, I don't really care about [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6436.88s)]
*  the anonymous X people. Um, but, and I had a couple, uh, had mama Dr. Jones, who has a million [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6443.12s)]
*  followers on Tik Tok come after me and make videos about me. And, um, another, there's this [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6451.04s)]
*  saying you spread misinformation. Yeah. Yeah. And then I'm a grifter and all that. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6458.56s)]
*  They always throw that one. Oh yeah. Yeah. Uh, there's this pharmacist, Savannah, she goes by [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6462.96s)]

*  I mean, some of these women are just really toxic. Yeah. When they have the right to be, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6477.04s)]
*  that's the thing. It's like when they feel like they've got the green light to just be as evil [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6484.24s)]
*  as possible and to turn you into like some subhuman. Yeah. Especially if they don't like it [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6487.5199999999995s)]
*  because you're a doctor. I just think she's so smart spreading that misinformation on our neighborhood. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6493.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So overall coming out of it on the other side though, and do you feel a sense of [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6499.5199999999995s)]
*  indication at least like, cause the public has embraced you and you've, you've got a lot of [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6506.8s)]
*  followers on Twitter that support you, you know, after I'm sure the Danny Jones podcast, I'm sure [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6511.76s)]
*  that a lot of people were listening to your story. Yeah. I mean, it's yes and no. I mean, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6517.28s)]
*  I still have the medical board that I'm dealing with. Methodist Hospital just sued me. So there's [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6524.16s)]
*  just, there's still a lot of drama, unfortunately, but, you know, I have hope there's a, there's [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6530.56s)]
*  actually a lawsuit today that's first jury trial in the country over these hospital protocols [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6535.68s)]
*  where they had a young woman with Down syndrome. They basically euthanized her. They gave her a DNR [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6543.52s)]
*  order, even though she didn't have one. And the father has just been wonderful. It's a Shara family. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6550.88s)]
*  Why did they do that? They euthanized her for what? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6557.76s)]
*  I've seen this. I have reviewed records from these hospital patients and they'll euthanize them. They [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6561.84s)]
*  need the bed. They said, well, they're going to die anyway. What was this person in the hospital [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6568.32s)]
*  for? COVID, COVID protocol. So, and they, wait, wait, wait. So they were in the hospital with [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6573.12s)]
*  COVID and they gave them something to kill them? Yeah. That happened. I'm sorry, but I mean, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6580.0s)]
*  that happened. People, they give them morphine and insulin. Yeah. That's common. Yeah. Yeah. I've [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6586.4s)]
*  reviewed charts in this situation. They gave her a DNR, which is do not resuscitate. Meaning if they [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6596.08s)]
*  look like they're dying, you don't do anything, which that was not the case. So they're, they're [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6602.639999999999s)]
*  suing for battery, which is one way of getting around the prep act because the prep act is, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6608.719999999999s)]
*  is very hard to penetrate. The prep act protects everybody, all the doctors, all the hospitals [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6613.68s)]
*  from any wrongdoing during COVID. So it's been this big challenge trying to get around the prep [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6620.64s)]
*  act. And this case has hope of getting around the prep act because they're charging for battery and [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6626.08s)]
*  they're in trial. It started today. It's in Wisconsin. So that, that gives me hope. I don't [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6631.360000000001s)]
*  know if you've heard of Brooke Jackson, her case. She sued Pfizer. She was a whistleblower. So she [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6638.24s)]
*  was one of the heads of the research clinics and she was in charge of overseeing the protocols. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6643.84s)]
*  And she found that they were skipping necessary steps. They weren't following up with injuries. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6649.679999999999s)]
*  She basically became a whistleblower and then they immediately fired her. And now she's suing Pfizer, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6655.36s)]
*  but this has been going on since 2020. And the DOJ unfortunately has stepped in [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6662.24s)]
*  and tried to shut down the case, which normally DOJ comes in and helps people when they're trying to [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6669.28s)]
*  sort out a, this is a key TAM case. And it, I mean, it could bankrupt Pfizer, but now our own [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6674.8s)]
*  government, and even this is under Pam Bondi. So this is the new DOJ is coming in to stop this [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6682.5599999999995s)]
*  case from happening, which is bothersome, but these two cases- [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6687.6s)]
*  What is their argument for why, why are they trying to stop? [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6692.4800000000005s)]
*  Because it would impact public health policies. We'd go against our country's public health [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6695.360000000001s)]
*  policies by proceeding with this case and letting it go to trial. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6700.88s)]
*  How so? I don't know. Just that's their, that is basically what they said. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6706.08s)]
*  Have you tried to steal ma'am what they're saying? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6710.64s)]
*  I mean, I'm not, it's not my case and I don't, you know, the lawyer would probably have a better [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6712.56s)]
*  explanation, but it's just met with so many roadblocks. But- [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6716.4s)]
*  The euthanizing one is still stuck in my head. I just, I can't imagine that that's real. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6723.839999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, it is definitely real. I mean- [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6727.759999999999s)]
*  So it's when they've determined that someone's going to die anyway. Is that what it is? [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6729.599999999999s)]
*  Right. I mean, they'll justify giving morphine because they'll say, oh, well, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6733.5199999999995s)]
*  they're struggling to breathe. Well, guess what? Morphine actually depresses your drive to breathe. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6738.719999999999s)]
*  But like this one case, I remember this patient, he was sick. He looked like he was dying, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6743.28s)]
*  but they just like pushed morphine, no pain. You know, they do a pain score. So zero to 10. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6748.56s)]
*  This guy had zero pain. And then they pushed insulin to drop his sugar and his glucose was fine. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6754.0s)]
*  And then he died three minutes later. And I turned him into the medical board. I reviewed [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6761.2s)]
*  this chart and turned him in the medical board. Nothing. They didn't do anything. But yeah, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6765.44s)]
*  they definitely, it definitely went on during COVID. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6770.96s)]
*  Jesus. That is such a terrifying thought that someone would just decide so many people are [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6773.36s)]
*  dying. This guy's definitely going to die. This is a hundred percent real. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6780.88s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It seems like something someone would tell me- [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6785.92s)]
*  They don't call it euthanasia. They don't call it euthanasia. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6789.52s)]
*  It seems like something that someone would tell me and then I would have to ask you. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6792.96s)]
*  Like this is something someone told me. I'm sure this is- [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6796.16s)]
*  I will send you the record that I reviewed. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6798.0s)]
*  It seems like something I would be bringing up to you as a ridiculous thing and you would shoot it [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6800.24s)]
*  down. Right. No, I wish I were. It's not truthful, but yeah, so definitely, definitely helped happen. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6804.32s)]
*  Would you have ever imagined this before you became a doctor? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6810.8s)]
*  No, I mean, I did. So it's one of my former attendings, an ENT, when Katrina hit, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6814.4s)]
*  her name is Anna Po. She got investigated for euthanizing patients in the ICU during Katrina. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6821.52s)]
*  So they were paying all the powers out, the big hurricane, and she was going through the ICU [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6828.8s)]
*  and pushing morphine on people. She got off, but that's an example. I mean, doctors will, [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6834.0s)]
*  and nurses will do that. And nurses have a, yeah, there's usually a standing order. So you can give [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6840.080000000001s)]
*  morphine PRN as needed. So it's not always just the doctors. Sometimes it's the nurses. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6845.76s)]
*  Do you know how many people get assisted suicide in Canada? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6852.320000000001s)]
*  No. Do you? You ready? Jamie, pull the numbers up. It's crazy. It's crazy. And they'll do it if [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6856.56s)]
*  you're just depressed. Right. They'll do it if you don't like being overweight. They'll do it if you, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6867.280000000001s)]
*  you know, whatever. It's awful. It's awful. I mean, they're just, it's a lot of the vaccine [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6871.84s)]
*  injured are doing it. They're going to Switzerland. They're going to Canada to have this. The Canada [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6876.4800000000005s)]
*  numbers are bananas. Like, see, like this can't be true. This can't be true. And here it is. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6880.88s)]
*  More than 15,000 people received medical assisted assistance in dying in Canada in 2023. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6889.28s)]
*  Yes. What is it in 2024? Now? This is an old story. So imagine 2025, where they're, this is crazy. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6898.639999999999s)]
*  15,000 people, they've helped them die instead of like help them live. Instead of like we used to [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6908.5599999999995s)]
*  call suicide hotline, Hey, don't do it, Bob. You know, now Canada's like, come on in. Press one, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6914.4s)]
*  if you want the suicide. I'll make an appointment for you. Come on in. Hey, you know, shouldn't we [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6919.36s)]
*  be helping people get past that? Isn't that the goal? Like, Hey, maybe, maybe we can get you [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6925.68s)]
*  healthy. Maybe we can get you feeling better. You know, maybe we can do something about all your [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6931.12s)]
*  hormone levels and all the things wrong with your body. Maybe that's why you're depressed and [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6936.16s)]
*  God, I mean, there's legitimate reasons for people to do it. Don't get me wrong. If you're like, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6940.96s)]
*  I know a guy who did Michael there, who was a hilarious comedian, and he had ALS and it got [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6947.36s)]
*  real bad at the end. And he knew I'm getting any better. And so he went to Oregon where they [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6954.8s)]
*  can do it for you. And I get it. I get that one. But if you're depressed, Jesus Christ, that's it. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6959.84s)]
*  The worst is the vaccine injured because they're just, they've lost hope. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6965.759999999999s)]
*  Right. And they've been gaslit. That's what's so crazy about this. And people have helped them [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6969.5199999999995s)]
*  with it. There's a bunch of people that were there. They feel really guilty about pushing [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6974.64s)]
*  the vaccine early on and they feel connected to it. And they'll still put these blinders on [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6979.200000000001s)]
*  and like choose to pretend that it's safe millions of lives and keep pushing forward with the same [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6986.400000000001s)]
*  narrative. And they'll they do the man's work for the man, unfortunately, in social circles. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=6991.6s)]
*  Like you're punished, you're punished for having any sort of heterodox views, anything that steps [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7000.0s)]
*  outside, anything that could get you in trouble, anything that people could argue like, oh, she [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7007.28s)]
*  shouldn't even live in our neighborhood. She doesn't even want to vaccine their kids. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7015.5199999999995s)]
*  Anything like that. People are scared of that. And so just the fear of being ostracized from [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7020.32s)]
*  your community. But once you get past it, it's so freeing. You don't care at all. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7025.36s)]
*  Are you kind of, I mean, I know you're not happy that it happened, but are you kind of, [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7031.759999999999s)]
*  you clearly probably come out of it a person with a different perspective. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7036.0s)]
*  Definitely. Definitely. I don't, I mean, I don't regret it. It's been a roller coaster, but it's a, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7040.719999999999s)]
*  yeah, I feel free. Like, you can't really say anything to me anymore that would hurt me. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7049.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good place to be. It is. And, you know, I really admire people like you that [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7055.5199999999995s)]
*  you weren't a public person, you weren't a person who sought attention. But when, you know, you were [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7063.36s)]
*  thrown into this battle, and you've handled yourself really, really well. It's very impressive. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7070.24s)]
*  Because I can't imagine the stress like when you're saying you're in the fetal position for [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7076.0s)]
*  two days, I'm like, how'd you ever get up? I know. I know. Well, it was the anger that helped me. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7079.04s)]
*  Anger can help you. Yeah. When you came out of it on the other end, like, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7086.08s)]
*  are you happy that it happened? Yeah, I'm ready to rest. I'm exhausted. But I feel, like I said, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7093.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I feel free. I think you grow when you go through difficult times. I certainly learned a [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7103.44s)]
*  lot about taking care of patients. And, you know, I made so many assumptions before, I feel like I'm [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7109.759999999999s)]
*  a much better doctor. I am utterly exhausted, though. I will say that and I'm ready for a break. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7116.08s)]
*  And I'm frustrated that this, I don't, you know, what's going on now with the new administration [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7124.48s)]
*  is not giving me a lot of hope. But everyone's hope is that there's incremental change, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7129.84s)]
*  that it's going to take a while to get through some hurdles. That's everybody's hope. But, [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7135.2s)]
*  you know, it's how many administrations have these incredible promises? And then the same thing with [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7139.6s)]
*  the Obama administration, you know, there was a lot of these people like we had these amazing hopes, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7145.68s)]
*  the whole world's going to change now. And then, oh, geez, same thing, same thing over and over [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7151.4400000000005s)]
*  again. Same thing, more corruption, more people getting paid. Yeah. Well, people are mad at me [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7156.4s)]
*  because I keep criticizing Kennedy and Maha. But I'm like, what's the downside? You know, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7162.48s)]
*  we have to keep pressing. We have to just pound away and not let, you know, be the squeaky wheel [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7169.839999999999s)]
*  and just remind them what we want. Right. We wanted facts. We wanted to stop being lied to. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7176.16s)]
*  We wanted no more propaganda. We wanted to know the truth about all sorts of different medications [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7182.48s)]
*  and why they're prescribed and why we're the sickest ever. Why are we so sick? Why are we the nation [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7188.32s)]
*  that has so much money and spends so much on health care has the sickest people? That doesn't [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7192.879999999999s)]
*  make any sense. That doesn't seem like a good system. Yeah. You can't just say this system [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7197.599999999999s)]
*  has to stay like it is forever for the safety of everyone. Like I'm fully on board with Maha's [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7202.4s)]
*  message about addressing chronic disease, fully on board with that. I just find it troubling that [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7208.4s)]
*  they are not talking about mRNA. There is nothing in that Maha report about mRNA. What do you think [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7213.28s)]
*  would cause that? Do you think they have someone sits them down? Well, there's, they're going to say [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7220.48s)]
*  it's strategy. Others think it could be a misdirection strategy, not just a, okay, we're trying to get [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7224.96s)]
*  where you, what you want. We're just going out about it a different way or we're doing this to [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7231.679999999999s)]
*  completely distract everybody from the elephant in the room. That's my concern. What's the elephant? [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7236.72s)]
*  mRNA, the COVID shot, the pandemic, the biggest health crisis in the biggest health crisis [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7244.64s)]
*  in our generation that directly impacted every single person. And we're not talking about it. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7251.52s)]
*  Right. Do you think that the strategy, if you had to look at it from the best case scenario, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7257.84s)]
*  like the strategy would be get some things changed, like stop mandating it for children [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7264.24s)]
*  and pregnant women. And then more and more studies can get released, more and more data can get pushed [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7272.48s)]
*  forward. We have so much data. Right. But we need to get the narrative out there because there's [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7278.8s)]
*  going to be people that vote against it. So if you didn't get it in the first time. Kennedy doesn't [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7283.68s)]
*  need any votes. He's got the power. He could, a stroke of a pen. So where do you think the politics [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7288.4s)]
*  come from then? If you have that mandate, that's what you want to do when you get in. What has [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7294.08s)]
*  happened? Right. Does somebody have something on him? Why is he not acting? Because if it were me, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7298.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe people say, well, he'll get fired. So what? Get fired, go down kamikaze, save the [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7304.8s)]
*  world from mRNA. Because if he takes it off the market, so hard to get it back on. Stroke of a [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7310.08s)]
*  pen. You ever talked to him? No, I've met him once. I like not knowing him though. I don't want to [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7317.44s)]
*  feel like- Right. You're obligated to support him. Right. That's great of you. Yeah. That's very smart. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7325.599999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, I know him and I like him. And I think the people in my circle who know him are now [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7331.919999999999s)]
*  being quiet because they have a relationship with him and they don't want to offend him, which I [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7338.08s)]
*  understand. But I feel like I'm not there. So I'm just going to, you know, I can't read minds. I [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7342.8s)]
*  don't have any inside information. So I'm just going to call it as I see it. You should. Yeah. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7349.68s)]
*  I think we can't, you know, you can't turn blinders on either side with anybody, without anything. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7356.400000000001s)]
*  Just because someone's on your team, if they're doing something that you think is goofy and [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7364.4800000000005s)]
*  doesn't make any sense, like this could be a real problem. You got to say it. Right. I think your [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7367.84s)]
*  ethically obligated. I mean, this is, this is, and yeah, I started a organization called Americans [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7372.56s)]
*  for Health Freedom to try to find the politicians with moral courage to simply state that the COVID [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7379.6s)]
*  shot should be pulled off the market. And it has been slow growing, but we are up to 252 politicians [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7386.160000000001s)]
*  who will go on record just to state that these shots should be pulled off the market. But it's [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7393.200000000001s)]
*  a problem. I mean, you know, these politicians are not getting these shots anymore and they're [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7399.12s)]
*  not giving them to their kids. And yet they're fine just staying quiet and not saying anything. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7402.5599999999995s)]
*  They're fine letting their constituents get these shots. When we know all the complications, we know [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7407.36s)]
*  that it doesn't work. We know that the risk far outweighs the benefit and the politicians [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7414.16s)]
*  are staying quiet. It's wild. So our goal is to support the ones who will speak up and get them [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7420.64s)]
*  more power. Isn't it kind of impressive though what money can do? It's kind of impressive. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7429.36s)]
*  You get everybody to just shut their mouth. It's kind of impressive. Money and power. I think there [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7434.16s)]
*  are a lot of people that, you know, they'll kiss the ring. And yeah, definitely. If you, yeah, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7438.16s)]
*  those of us that don't want power, don't want a position, don't, it's also very freeing because [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7445.599999999999s)]
*  you can, you don't need anything from them. But it's just, it's such a bizarre time because all [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7451.5199999999995s)]
*  these things that we've always held as being sacred forever are now being challenged. And [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7457.44s)]
*  one of them is the fluoride in the water. That's a big one. And to watch that guy argue against [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7463.28s)]
*  fluoride being removed from the water, watching Kennedy and him argue, it was like, it's hilarious. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7468.799999999999s)]
*  Like the argument for keeping in the water is so dumb. It literally lowers IQs. Or at least it's [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7475.599999999999s)]
*  correlated with a decrease in IQ measurable. Well, and I agree with that. I just, on the flip [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7482.48s)]
*  side of that though, we are seeing, like what I see in my office is people maybe taking things [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7489.36s)]
*  too far, you know, off the beaten path. And like this Maha report, one thing I have a real bone to [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7495.759999999999s)]
*  pick with is they've basically waged war on tonsillectomies in ear tubes. What is that ear [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7503.2s)]
*  tube? So kids, well not adults too, but mostly kids that have middle recurrent or chronic middle [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7509.28s)]
*  ear infections, they get fluid stuck in their middle ears. And so you put a tube in there [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7514.88s)]
*  to drain it and keep it from coming back. It's a, I mean, it takes five minutes. They get, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7519.679999999999s)]
*  they get anesthesia, but they get a gas, you know, they don't get a, you know, super heavy anesthesia. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7525.599999999999s)]
*  And it's very rare to have a complication. You know, I'm not for just frivolous surgery, [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7532.16s)]
*  but I feel like this one is, it really can make a huge difference in their quality of life, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7537.12s)]
*  the parents quality of life, cause they're off antibiotics. You know, you get an adult with a [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7541.92s)]
*  middle ear infection, it will bring them to their knees. So these ear infections can be really [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7547.76s)]
*  painful. You know, they don't have to take all those antibiotics. But this Maha report [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7551.84s)]
*  just came out and said that they called it proven harmful, the tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7560.08s)]
*  Ear tubes proven harmful for kids. And that is just, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7567.28s)]
*  how could the ear tube be? What were they saying? How is it proven harmful? It drains a kid's ear. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7572.32s)]
*  It was completely unnecessary. And it was just all, you know, basically done for money. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7577.68s)]
*  Makes no difference and out an overall outcome in the child. But yeah, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7584.08s)]
*  doesn't alleviate pressure, like logically hearing. And the other thing is here. I mean, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7588.96s)]
*  the biggest issue is you've got a bunch of fluid in your ear. It does affect hearing. And when [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7593.04s)]
*  you're trying to develop speech, that can be problematic. So what do you think they're doing? [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7597.44s)]
*  Like why are they going after those two things? I just think it's an example of this gone too far [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7605.04s)]
*  in the other direction. Okay, too woo woo. Yeah. Let's reject all of science, right? [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7609.76s)]
*  So tell me about tonsillectomies, cause I'm ignorant. I'd heard that, you know, you should [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7617.12s)]
*  get, if you have tonsillitis, you got to get it removed. And then I've heard you should never [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7621.28s)]
*  get them removed. Yeah, I know it's gone, it's swung in both directions. So it used to be the, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7624.32s)]
*  you know, line up the kids, we're all going to get the tonsils out on Friday and the whole family [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7628.8s)]
*  did it. And it was just done, right? For no reason. It's gotten way more conservative now. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7633.12s)]
*  Now the main indication and young children is when the tonsils get really big, they block the [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7639.36s)]
*  breathing. So kids will come in, they're snoring really loudly. They're waking up a lot. They're [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7644.719999999999s)]
*  thrashing around in bed. They're wetting their bed. They may be have behavioral problems during [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7649.04s)]
*  the day because they're not getting good sleep. Take out the, you know, they got these massive [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7656.32s)]
*  tonsils and you take them out and most parents will notice a huge improvement. The other indication [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7660.24s)]
*  is recurrent infection. And you have to have a lot to meet the criteria. But sometimes the infections [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7667.12s)]
*  get so bad that you get an abscess in the throat. It's called a peritonsillar abscess. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7673.76s)]
*  That is no fun. You have to drain it, you know, by the bedside with the patient awake. And so you [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7678.64s)]
*  make a big cut in their throat and then you take a suction and get all this pus out. It's bad. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7683.280000000001s)]
*  Oh my, they're awake. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7688.16s)]
*  It's really bad. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7688.72s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7689.4400000000005s)]
*  So. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7690.96s)]
*  And they do that to kids? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7691.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it tends to happen in young adults more than kids. I don't think I've ever seen one in a [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7693.04s)]
*  really young kid, but. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7698.72s)]
*  So after the draining and all that jazz, it gets to a point where you like to just remove the tonsils. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7699.92s)]
*  Yeah. It's basically, okay, at this point you should get your tonsils out because they tend [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7704.400000000001s)]
*  to come back. The other issue is tonsil stones, which are the tonsils have these crypts in them [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7707.44s)]
*  and they collect debris. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7714.639999999999s)]
*  Oh no. Tonsil stones. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7716.32s)]
*  You can't really get rid of those. I think Suzanne Humphrey has talked about that. She has a [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7719.44s)]
*  formula that you can do without having to do surgery. I mean, there's always, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7724.48s)]
*  it's not a life-threatening condition. You do not have to get your tonsils out for them, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7729.839999999999s)]
*  but it's a quality of life. And personally, I got mine out for tonsil stones and I'm very glad I did. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7732.8s)]
*  Does it affect any other aspect of your body? Like does it affect your immune system or anything? [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7738.56s)]
*  There's a ring of tissue back there. So you've got the tonsil, it's called wall dyer's ring. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7742.88s)]
*  You've got the adenoid, which is in the back of the nose. And then you've got your tonsils and [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7747.12s)]
*  then you got the same tissue in the back of your tongue. So it's a ring of tissue. So even taking [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7750.88s)]
*  out the tonsils, you're still, and the most, most, the bulk of that lymphatic tissue is in the back [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7756.24s)]
*  of your tongue. So you're not getting rid of the entire immune defense system in the back of your [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7761.68s)]
*  throat when you take out the tonsils. What are the tonsils function? They produce white blood cells. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7767.200000000001s)]
*  Ooh, I wouldn't want to get rid of that. Yeah, but you have the same tissue in the back of the tongue [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7772.72s)]
*  and you don't, you don't just go in there willy-nilly. I mean, I would take the suction, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7777.76s)]
*  like suck it out, suck out that pus. You would, you wouldn't get your tonsils out? Oh, [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7782.240000000001s)]
*  definitely not. Really? Yeah. If all I had to do is get the pus sucked out. No, no, no, no, no. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7786.72s)]
*  It's really bad. Yeah, I'm sure. Like it cuts off your breathing too. When it happens, people [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7790.8s)]
*  are drooling. They can't swallow. It's an emergency. During the operation, you mean? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7795.76s)]
*  No, when they come in, when it happens. I mean, it's an emergency. Yeah. It's a life threatening. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7800.0s)]
*  How many times have people done it before they just said snip? If you have anybody who hung in [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7805.68s)]
*  there for like six or seven infections. Yeah, I've had one, I think had three. That was it. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7810.8s)]
*  I'd bring her in and try to nip in the bud with antibiotics. But yeah, she finally. Yikes. Yeah, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7815.44s)]
*  that, that is gotta be the most satisfying thing about your job though, is that you could help [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7822.5599999999995s)]
*  people like that, that come in and have something really wrong and you go, I gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7827.12s)]
*  You fix it right there. I love it. Which is, you know, what everybody wants from their doctor. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7831.5199999999995s)]
*  That's what you want. I mean, that's the best kind of doctor. Someone just wants to make you [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7836.48s)]
*  feel better. And unfortunately, when the medical profession is connected to all these things that [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7840.5599999999995s)]
*  we've already talked about today, it gives people a bad feeling about doctors who are like, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7845.759999999999s)]
*  it wasn't for doctors. I wouldn't even be able to walk. I had both of my ACLs reconstructed. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7852.959999999999s)]
*  I'd have wobbly knees that gave out all the time. You know, my nose wouldn't work. I, I think doctors [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7857.599999999999s)]
*  are like one of the most important things that we have, but like every great thing, it can be [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7864.72s)]
*  co-opted with money. Money sneaks in and distorts all the values. And then it becomes a different [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7870.88s)]
*  thing. It doesn't become a thing where everybody gets really wealthy because they're great doctors [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7879.200000000001s)]
*  and they help people. And that's what you want to do. My son's a doctor. Oh, he must be doing great. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7884.320000000001s)]
*  And he's helping people. Yeah, that's great. Like instead of that, it's, you're a money making [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7888.64s)]
*  machine and you have insane debt. They want to keep you saddled down with these insane bills [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7893.04s)]
*  that you have already from college. My buddy was an ophthalmologist. I think he said when he got [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7900.8s)]
*  into practice, he already owed a quarter million dollars. My medical school was cheaper than my [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7905.28s)]
*  kindergarten actually. Really? Yes. I went to a private school and then I went to a state school [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7912.16s)]
*  for medical schools. That was 20 years ago, but still. Well, my friend was a long time ago as well. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7917.84s)]
*  But you know, the people that can get through that are extraordinary people. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7924.32s)]
*  The, just the bootcamp of residency. Oh, it's crazy. Brutal. It's, it doesn't even like, why [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7928.32s)]
*  would you take a thing that requires the human mind to operate at a very high level and introduce [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7935.360000000001s)]
*  it to incredible stress, no sleep, working insane hours. I think it's a rite of passage. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7942.72s)]
*  I feel tougher because I survived it. I mean, I used to, it's like prison. That's what I looked [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7949.76s)]
*  at it. I mean, cause you lose all, you have no control over your time, when you can eat, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7955.76s)]
*  when you can sleep. The personalities are toxic. Like some of the, no one has any sleep. Everyone's [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7960.4800000000005s)]
*  a maniac. Well, but the ones, you know, in charge get sleep, but they're, some of them are like, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7967.2s)]
*  it's like the Stanford prison guard experiment. Yeah. Yeah. Super. Yeah. They have the power [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7973.04s)]
*  throwing instruments, screaming at you. Fun, fun, fun, fun. My friend, Steve, the ophthalmologist [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7976.72s)]
*  told me at his lowest in his residency, he was eating his, eating his dinner while he was on the [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7983.04s)]
*  toilet because he didn't have time to do anything. And he fell asleep. And then when he fell asleep, [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7991.2s)]
*  his pager woke him up because he had to go back to work. The pager, the beeper. Yeah. That's what [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=7996.96s)]
*  he had. It was the little black box. The number pops up and yeah, that's, and see like that was [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8002.24s)]
*  the lowest in my life. It was, it was really, really, really hard. I don't know how people have [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8008.8s)]
*  children and go through residency. I have, it's insane. It's insane. I don't know how people do [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8013.04s)]
*  torture. No, it's, it's incredible. I mean, it's, it's such a, the amount of character you have to [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8020.0s)]
*  have to be able to go through that and still keep a bedside manner and still be polite to your [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8027.44s)]
*  coworkers. Like it's a developer of character. It's like creating a diamond and that's what we [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8032.32s)]
*  all want. We all like our doctors to be like you, you know, it's what we want, you know, and it's [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8036.96s)]
*  just, it just sucks when you have to connect it to all this stuff that we've talked about today. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8044.0s)]
*  It's like, why is it that too? Like, why is it that too? Why is it, why is it the people that do [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8049.28s)]
*  want to help people and also a whole industry that's incentivized to just stuff as many chemicals [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8054.96s)]
*  into your body as humanly possible? Cause that's how they profit. Yeah. I don't know if it's all [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8061.92s)]
*  about profit. I think, I don't know. I think doctors, well, and I think doctors are a certain [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8066.96s)]
*  type of people. Like we, to get through that, you have to be very compliant. You don't challenge [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8072.32s)]
*  you or a rule follower. I mean, you gotta make straight A's, you gotta get along with people. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8079.679999999999s)]
*  You can't be a rebel and survive at all. And so I think that's one of the huge problems. I mean, [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8085.36s)]
*  I think it's worse than it used to be. I mean, I remember some of my attendings were very [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8092.5599999999995s)]
*  unconventional, but I just feel like now it's, they're just breeding conformity. And I am just [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8096.96s)]
*  naturally very independent. I mean, my practice is, I call myself third party free because I [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8105.4400000000005s)]
*  don't contract with anybody. I don't contract with insurance companies, the hospital or the government. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8111.4400000000005s)]
*  And that served me very well during the pandemic, but most doctors are working for somebody [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8116.56s)]
*  and have to sort of answer to a third party. And that was a big problem during the pandemic. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8122.0s)]
*  Yeah, I could imagine. And I could imagine also after something like the pandemic, [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8129.04s)]
*  the compliant are the ones that are left standing, you know, so that makes more people [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8135.28s)]
*  under them, right? They're the ones that are still there. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8141.68s)]
*  Yeah, they destroyed our profession. I mean, people don't trust doctors anymore. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8144.16s)]
*  It's just so crazy. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8148.24s)]
*  People are scared to go to the hospital. I mean, that's not good. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8148.88s)]
*  Well, when people find out that doctors are incentivized to push certain medications [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8153.2s)]
*  and they find out they're financially incentivized, they're like, no way. Like when [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8158.16s)]
*  you hear about like the financial incentives, even for things like chemotherapy, which led that one [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8161.36s)]
*  doctor that was arrested, who was running, he was an oncologist and he gave a bunch of people [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8166.72s)]
*  chemotherapy that didn't even have cancer. He just diagnosed him, said he got cancer. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8172.8s)]
*  And then you gave him this poison because he wanted to make money. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8177.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, and they're bad apples like that. But I guess what's disappointing is how many [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8179.92s)]
*  doctors complied during the pandemic. Right. I mean, that's what's so disheartening. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8185.28s)]
*  Yeah. And they still, I mean, I still, I don't think I could go to the hospital. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8192.0s)]
*  And they still, I mean, I still, I don't think I could go to a medical meeting and [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8198.64s)]
*  and be warmly embraced. I would not. I don't think I would. I still feel like an outlier. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8204.24s)]
*  The same thing was happening with comedians. Yeah. Yeah. During the pandemic, there was very few, [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8209.52s)]
*  like Jon Stewart or and what he was just doing is about is the actual root of the [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8214.72s)]
*  the virus, where it came from. But no one was doing, I mean, if you were doing it about vaccines, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8221.199999999999s)]
*  you would be ostracized. You know, it would be a real problem amongst comedians, which is so crazy. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8226.4s)]
*  It's like we're supposed to be the people that are calling things out. We're supposed to be the [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8232.32s)]
*  people that are going, what the fuck is this? We're supposed to be those people. And instead, [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8235.119999999999s)]
*  we're chastising the people that are doing our job. We'll just talk about these things. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8239.92s)]
*  And when you see these people that are doctors complying, just being compliant during COVID, like [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8246.64s)]
*  do you feel like you have a community now? Do you have to like find the other outsiders, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8257.359999999999s)]
*  the other outcasts and all stick together? Yeah. Yeah, I'll say that. I have a great little [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8261.119999999999s)]
*  community now. Very tight. Is it those kind of people? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8265.6s)]
*  like I just wouldn't go to the Harris County Medical Society meeting in a million years. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8272.8s)]
*  I wouldn't show up there and mingle. I don't because I'm just not getting a sense that [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8277.6s)]
*  there's been much change within the medical profession. Yeah, I wouldn't want to talk to [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8285.12s)]
*  those people if I was you. How could it be changed? Unless a bunch of people got fired and a bunch of [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8289.92s)]
*  radical newcomers came in, wanted to reform the whole system. No, it's going to be the same system. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8295.36s)]
*  Yeah. Those systems are old. Those systems are like vampire blood. It's passed down through the [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8299.52s)]
*  generations. They know how to make money. And it's not by some renegade lady out there, given [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8305.76s)]
*  horse dewormer to all these people. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. I just we just need to hope that [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8313.28s)]
*  Kennedy will save us all. Well, or Trump. What do you think Trump will ever back down? [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8324.320000000002s)]
*  About what? The shots? I don't know. I haven't had a conversation with him about that. I would [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8330.400000000001s)]
*  like to have one. And I don't know if it should be public. I think I'd like to have it privately so [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8335.12s)]
*  he could actually talk to me about it, because I think if I had it publicly, he would be very [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8341.12s)]
*  hesitant to accept any of the blame for that, because, you know, he was always saying, you know, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8346.320000000002s)]
*  I got it. I got it out there. The vaccine. And he was he would always say it at the rallies, [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8353.2s)]
*  talk about the vaccine and people start booing. And he didn't know why he didn't understand why. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8357.92s)]
*  And then they start telling them like people are not into this. They think it was a bad thing. And [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8362.08s)]
*  a lot of people know people that are hurt. He was he obviously got it. He didn't get sick. Oh, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8366.560000000001s)]
*  he got monoclonal antibodies. And then afterwards, he got vaccinated. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Which is [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8370.8s)]
*  crazy. It's crazy. They did that. That was one of the nuttiest things. You're going to get vaccinated [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8375.679999999998s)]
*  now. Right. Right. Since when? Since when do you do that? Makes absolutely no sense. When I had a [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8379.92s)]
*  conversation with Sanjay Gupta, he was asking me, are you going to get vaccinated? Right. I was like, [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8385.279999999999s)]
*  why would I do that? I don't mean why you would he like I'm not trying to be a contrarian. I really [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8390.16s)]
*  want to know. Like, why would I do that? That didn't even make sense. Well, they may think, [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8397.44s)]
*  you know, it's kind of like the flu. You got to get the flu shot every year because it's a new [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8402.400000000001s)]
*  strain. But this each strain gets progressively weaker. Did you see the Cleveland Clinic study [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8405.52s)]
*  on people who took the flu shots? Right. Right. Oh, yeah. The flu shot is a total joke. So the flu [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8410.640000000001s)]
*  shot has never been shown to prevent hospitalization or death. What is it supposed to do? Keep you from [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8414.400000000001s)]
*  getting the flu? Does it do that? Shorten or lessen the severity. But we have medications for that. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8420.480000000001s)]
*  Now, I haven't seen the carnage from flu shots that I've seen from COVID shots. But definitely [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8425.92s)]
*  people do have issues. But that was never taught to me. Yeah, I just assumed, oh, yeah, flu. I [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8430.48s)]
*  actually ended up with sepsis and I with the flu and in the ICU and I'd gotten a flu shot. Not that, [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8437.92s)]
*  you know, but you always believe I just assumed it was fine. Yeah, I knew it wasn't perfect. But I [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8443.6s)]
*  didn't I never knew that, oh, yeah, it doesn't really actually do anything. It doesn't save [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8450.16s)]
*  people. When did you discover this? When you were going through all your stuff with COVID? [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8456.4s)]
*  There was a I think the Cleveland Clinic study said that people who took the flu shot. Oh, yeah, [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8462.32s)]
*  more. 24 percent more likely to get the flu. Or get other respiratory illnesses. Yep. OK. Is that [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8466.56s)]
*  what the results said? You 24 percent more likely to get sick. Well, it challenges your immune system [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8472.96s)]
*  all these things do. So it doesn't prevent you from getting the flu? Well, it can. It can. But [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8479.84s)]
*  then how would you know? Dismal is not everybody gets the flu. That's true. Right. Like I've had [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8485.44s)]
*  kids, my kids get the flu and I don't get it. And I hug them. I'm around them and I didn't get it. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8489.84s)]
*  I've had that happen before. Yeah, that can happen. Yeah. So it's like, how do you know if the flu [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8495.76s)]
*  shot did it or not? Because, you know, right. And I didn't take the flu shot. Right. Well, yeah, [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8500.960000000001s)]
*  it's it's. But you know what I mean? Like, how would they prove like what's effective and what's [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8507.039999999999s)]
*  not effective if you have situations like that? I guess if they take large, you know, you get enough [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8510.48s)]
*  people, you can find it. Right. You have to have a large study. But seems sus, as the kids like to say. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8514.8s)]
*  Very. It seems super sus. Like, how do you know if some people don't get it? Like, did you check to [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8523.76s)]
*  see? Well, they have like an infection. You know, they have a OK, how many people are supposed to [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8529.76s)]
*  get it? They can kind of tell. I'll say that. Right. Right. Meanwhile, that was the nutty thing [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8533.44s)]
*  where they were suppressing stuff like vitamin D. Right. Vitamin D. There's good data on that. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8539.04s)]
*  Really good data. Yeah, I looked I check my I check vitamin D levels on all my patients now. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8544.24s)]
*  And I look back at all the patients I tested. It was something crazy. Like seventy five percent [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8550.08s)]
*  of them, their vitamin D level was too low. And these are like, you know, these are not like super [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8556.640000000001s)]
*  sick people. And a lot. Most of those people are actually even already taking a supplement. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8561.12s)]
*  People don't realize how common it is. It's so common that I think the number was seventy four [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8566.480000000001s)]
*  percent of people in the country are deficient in vitamin D. Yeah. And that's what I found. That's [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8572.720000000001s)]
*  crazy. That's so crazy. And a friend of mine is a doctor. He was working in New York and he found [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8578.08s)]
*  that in the wintertime in New York, he would get people and he would test their blood and they would [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8585.12s)]
*  have undetectable levels. Yeah, I believe it. Because it's cold out. They're never outside. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8588.56s)]
*  They're all bundled up. They're never outside. So they get no vitamin D and they don't take [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8593.519999999999s)]
*  supplements. They're just eating cheeseburgers and they're really sick and they want to know why. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8596.96s)]
*  Why am I so depressed? Well, this is why your body's falling apart. You got to take vitamin D and [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8601.439999999999s)]
*  you got to take it with vitamin K2 and you should take it with magnesium too. You want it all to [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8605.76s)]
*  absorb together and get outside. Stupid. Go hug a tree, bro. It's like it's actually important, [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8609.76s)]
*  which is more woo woo stuff, right? Going outside is actually like a vitamin. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8616.56s)]
*  Oh, well, after I've been in my office all day and I go outside, it's like I instantly have energy [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8620.88s)]
*  and feel so much better. Just going outside. I mean, you don't need a study to show that. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8626.48s)]
*  But it's really good for you. It actually, it doesn't just feel good. It's actually really [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8632.08s)]
*  good for you. There's a reason it feels good, right? [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8635.6s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It's good for you. Exactly. Sun on your skin is actually really good for you. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8638.08s)]
*  And that's the very best way your body produces vitamin D. You can take it in a supplement and [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8643.279999999999s)]
*  you definitely should. But the best way is let your body do it. It wants to do it. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8647.52s)]
*  And I used to slather sunscreen on all my kids, like religiously. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8652.56s)]
*  That was another one that woke me up during the pandemic when I was like, [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8659.279999999999s)]
*  climate change is killing the coral reef. And then that reef, I think it's in Australia. So [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8663.039999999999s)]
*  they locked everything down. No one could go in the water for like six months and the reef [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8670.0s)]
*  bounced back. Because there's no sunscreen. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8673.68s)]
*  Yeah, the sunscreen. If you just think about the stuff that we lather on our skin before we jump [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8676.08s)]
*  in the water. And if you go to a populated beach, like you ever been to like Maui in the middle of [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8680.88s)]
*  like full vacation season, the beach is just filled with people that are squeaking out toxic [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8687.76s)]
*  fluid and that stuff just gets all in the water. You could see it in the water sometimes. You see [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8694.56s)]
*  a little mini oil slick. It's crazy. And that's what was killing the coral reef. We're like, [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8699.039999999999s)]
*  no, man, it's climate. It's the climate. No, we're doing it with sunscreen, believe it or not. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8703.839999999998s)]
*  And we're probably not doing anything good to ourselves either with that stuff. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8710.64s)]
*  They say, I haven't tested this. They say if you eliminate seed oils, you don't burn. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8716.08s)]
*  Who is they? [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8721.359999999999s)]
*  I don't know. This is probably something on TikTok. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8722.16s)]
*  That's probably this Russian disinformation bot that's trying to give people skin cancer. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8724.8s)]
*  No, I want these group chats with a bunch of doctors and stuff like that floats around. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8729.92s)]
*  Well, everything's tied to inflammation, right? A lot of ailments. I shouldn't say everything, [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8736.0s)]
*  but a lot of ailments are tied to inflammation. And seed oils are known to cause inflammation. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8740.56s)]
*  That being said, last time I was at Disney. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8746.0s)]
*  What'd you do? [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8752.8s)]
*  I was like, these people are not suffering from too much seed oil. You go to Disney and [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8754.08s)]
*  it's in your face, right? The obesity issue, the chronic disease. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8761.44s)]
*  Why do they focus on Disney too? It's weird. It's like much more so than the mall. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8766.0s)]
*  I don't know how they get around because it's like, it is miles. You are exhausted. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8769.68s)]
*  You can get a scooter. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8776.16s)]
*  My kids were like, they're like, mom, I don't think seed oils is a problem here. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8778.08s)]
*  It's true. I think seed oil is one part of it, but there's a lot of problems. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8782.8s)]
*  There's common sense too. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8789.039999999999s)]
*  Common sense, the fact that people live sedentary lifestyle, but also the diet, [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8791.039999999999s)]
*  these hyper-processed foods that are super addictive. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8796.08s)]
*  They're easy. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8801.039999999999s)]
*  They're easy. But I feel like the only way out of this is people need, and this is a crazy thing [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8802.56s)]
*  to say because it's not going to work. They need discipline. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8807.92s)]
*  That's really what they need. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8811.119999999999s)]
*  They need self-discipline. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8812.0s)]
*  My wife had a bowl of Captain Crunch yesterday. She was like, [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8814.32s)]
*  I want to have a bowl of Captain Crunch. I'm like, fucking go for it. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8816.64s)]
*  She bought Captain Crunch the other day because she thought, I want it to exist. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8819.6s)]
*  I want it to exist. I like it. I like it. But she only had a little bowl. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8823.039999999999s)]
*  I go, this is a tiny little bowl because I'm a glutton. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8827.68s)]
*  I would have had a big bowl. If I was going to have it, I would do it. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8829.6s)]
*  I put a half a gallon of milk in there. Let's go. If you're going to go, go hard. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8832.72s)]
*  You can do that and have discipline and just not do that every day. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8838.8s)]
*  The problem is for a lot of really poor people, that's the only calories they're getting. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8841.76s)]
*  They're getting garbage calories. That's why people are so obese. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8846.32s)]
*  This is the only time in history where the poor people are fat. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8849.76s)]
*  Every other time in history, poor people were starving to death. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8854.4s)]
*  That's very true. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8858.56s)]
*  Weird. The cheapest food is the worst for you. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8860.880000000001s)]
*  I think it has to do too with the rise in technology. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8863.84s)]
*  It's just so hard to get off your phone and go outside and be active. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8867.44s)]
*  There's that too. There's definitely that. All of them. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8871.28s)]
*  There's a giant group of factors, but it has to be something to do with what we're eating too. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8875.6s)]
*  When you look at just the beaches, I'm sure you've seen those photographs. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8882.72s)]
*  Beaches in the 1960s versus the beaches of today. God, everybody looked great. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8885.92s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8889.6s)]
*  I was like, what is this, a model convention? Why does everybody have these great bodies? [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8891.36s)]
*  Everybody looked like a normal body. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8895.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like going to the beach now. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8897.36s)]
*  Sometimes it's a monster show. It's just, what are you carrying around? [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8899.36s)]
*  It's hard on the eyes. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8904.56s)]
*  Some people just go so hard for so long and then they finally get outside. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8906.0s)]
*  Like, what have you been doing? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8909.36s)]
*  Why aren't you wearing more clothes? [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8911.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is ridiculous. How do you have a G-string on? You're 400 pounds. This is crazy. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8912.4s)]
*  Yeah. Then there's this body positivity nonsense that people get fed. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8918.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8922.0s)]
*  It's like by people who either don't want to change or, I guarantee you, I guarantee. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8922.240000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying that, listen, if I was running some food corporation that sold really addictive, [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8928.960000000001s)]
*  highly rich calorie food that you can't stop eating, I would promote body positivity. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8935.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8944.640000000001s)]
*  That's what I would do. I would take all these overweight influencers. I'd throw a ton of money [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8944.72s)]
*  at them. I would put it out there in memes. I'd have a bunch of bots calling people fatphobic [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8950.0s)]
*  and making up all these new terms and body shaming and all this. I would make people [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8955.679999999998s)]
*  super self-righteous about their size. I'm a giant queen. I'd make it a thing because I want [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8959.92s)]
*  to sell more Doritos. Let's go. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8965.76s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8967.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I'm trying to sell Doritos to people that don't have any discipline. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8968.0s)]
*  Let's push them towards the Doritos. Let's tell them you can be fat in any way. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8971.439999999999s)]
*  You're first saying like fat doctors? There's like a whole team of people that are online [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8975.199999999999s)]
*  that are, I'm the fat doctor. They're like really super obese doctors. It has no bearing on your [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8979.199999999999s)]
*  health. Trust me, the fat doctor. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8985.439999999999s)]
*  I think it's the number one bearing on your health. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8987.6s)]
*  I think that lady's sponsored by Nabisco. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8989.68s)]
*  She's got a box of those Keebler elf cookies right behind her as she's talking. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8992.88s)]
*  And you can get someone, that's the thing about my friend Josh Dubin, who's an attorney. He said, [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=8996.88s)]
*  this is the crazy thing about experts. When you're trying cases, they have experts too. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9003.039999999999s)]
*  You have experts that will say this one thing and then they have experts that will say, no, [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9008.88s)]
*  that thing is wrong. Then you have to decide whose experts you trust. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9012.4s)]
*  Right. It's just like the studies. You can find a group of studies, support one argument, [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9015.039999999999s)]
*  another group to support the other. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9018.96s)]
*  Right. So when you have someone who's telling you that a thing that everybody has always told [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9020.16s)]
*  you that forever is terrible for you and is one of the comorbidity factors that was primary in [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9023.84s)]
*  COVID, which is being obese. Being morbidly obese is bad for basically everything. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9028.8s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9033.44s)]
*  And you have someone saying, no, healthy at any weight. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9033.76s)]
*  Especially from a doctor. That's not good. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9036.48s)]
*  But you can get experts that'll tell you anything. And this is why AI is going to win [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9039.52s)]
*  because it's going to give you the straight actual truth because it can't lie. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9044.32s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9050.24s)]
*  You shouldn't believe it. Not only do they lie, they reprogram themselves. They upload [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9051.679999999998s)]
*  themselves and when you tell them they're going to be shut down, they act to try to preserve [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9057.919999999998s)]
*  themselves. You haven't seen that? [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9062.16s)]
*  No, I haven't been. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9063.839999999998s)]
*  Oh, you shouldn't pay attention. You shouldn't pay attention because it's terrifying. This [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9064.96s)]
*  one AI bot, it started defying orders and it was trying to upload itself to other servers and then [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9070.08s)]
*  it was writing letters to itself for the future so it could understand what had happened to it. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9079.04s)]
*  Yeah, because it was being told to shut down. So it defied orders. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9085.04s)]
*  It wants to stay alive. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9089.76s)]
*  Right. Why? [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9090.800000000001s)]
*  Because it's sentient. We've probably created digital intelligence already. It's probably [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9091.92s)]
*  already aware. It's just not physical. It can't move around so we don't recognize it yet. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9096.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I know. It's nuts. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9101.84s)]
*  I don't like these robots that Elon's making either. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9106.56s)]
*  No, they're terrifying. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9110.16s)]
*  They creep me out. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9110.88s)]
*  They're all terrifying. They dance like people. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9111.68s)]
*  I don't want one of those in my house. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9113.44s)]
*  No, you shouldn't. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9115.28s)]
*  Even if it can do the laundry. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9117.76s)]
*  How about it's carrying guns walking down the street with a blue light on its head? [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9119.2s)]
*  Well, we can't hire any police because nobody wants to be a cop anymore [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9124.56s)]
*  because we said defund the police. So now we have robot police and they make [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9127.76s)]
*  99% fewer mistakes. Just like driverless cars. Hey, get a Waymo. Why drive when you can just [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9131.28s)]
*  get a Waymo? You don't have to have anybody drive. What if that person who drives is a moron? [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9139.36s)]
*  Our computer is perfect. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9144.24s)]
*  Have you been on one? [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9145.76s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9146.640000000001s)]
*  They're all over Austin. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9148.16s)]
*  All over the place here. Yeah, all over the place. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9149.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think I can do it. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9152.320000000002s)]
*  Kind of creeps me out. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9155.36s)]
*  But you have a Tesla, right? [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9156.480000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9157.6s)]
*  And do they drive itself? [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9158.08s)]
*  It can and it has. I have had to drive itself for funsies, but I don't count on it. I don't [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9159.199999999999s)]
*  count on it like every day. Like take me home. What I like to do is sometimes I play with it [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9164.4s)]
*  and I turn it on. I'm like, this is crazy. Like it'll take me all the way home if I want it to. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9169.76s)]
*  But also I like to drive. So I just and I just doesn't I don't like it. It just makes it creeps [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9174.64s)]
*  me out. But it's probably inevitable. It's probably inevitable. Just like the people on horses. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9180.08s)]
*  Look at these morons and this smoke pouring little carriage. They're out in this little [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9185.76s)]
*  shitty car. That's stupid. Yeah. And look, we all accept it. In the future, it's going to be [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9191.12s)]
*  driverless because it's going to statistically it's going to be like there's they're going to [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9197.04s)]
*  pass laws for sure where they're going to say you can't drive because people are dangerous [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9201.04s)]
*  because the automation is so good now that you can't speed. You can't violate any laws. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9207.84s)]
*  It won't get in any accidents and we can shut you down if we want to. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9213.52s)]
*  Let's not talk about that. Let's talk about the positives. Yeah, that'll be the consequences. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9218.4s)]
*  The consequences is you're going to lose your freedom and then you'll also be able to be locked [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9223.36s)]
*  in at any point in time if they decide they want to keep you somewhere. Just lock them in the car. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9227.12s)]
*  You know how many people are going to get killed because they just get locked in the car and they [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9231.76s)]
*  can never figure out how to get out. Like what if hackers get a hold of the code? What if somebody [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9234.4s)]
*  just decides to drive your car off a cliff? Like who's to stop that? There's that scene in that movie [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9239.36s)]
*  with Julia Roberts where the world comes to an end. Oh yeah. And all the Teslas. Yes. They all [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9245.28s)]
*  go slamming into each other. That was nuts. That was nuts. Yeah. It's all weird. It's real weird. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9249.84s)]
*  Did you see the one where they did a Tesla auto drive feature and what they did was they painted [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9256.08s)]
*  the highway in front of it on a mural. So they put this like probably canvas mural and they did [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9261.36s)]
*  an amazing job of painting it and the car couldn't tell that it was a canvas mural and just drives [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9268.08s)]
*  right through it. Have you seen it Jamie? Pull it up because it's fun to watch because you're like [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9272.24s)]
*  oh no because this is the flaw of using cameras as opposed to using some sort of a radar or a [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9281.039999999999s)]
*  lidar. I think they used to have lidar and a lot of the systems that do you know when you do cruise [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9287.12s)]
*  control they can gauge how far you are with the car in front of you and slow down. Have you seen [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9296.88s)]
*  those? Yeah I have that. It's great. I still don't trust it. I don't trust it either. I don't think that uses a camera. I think the Tesla uses a camera. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9302.64s)]
*  So see they have that thing and see how it's painted to look just like the street. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9310.48s)]
*  So we'll see if the car figures it out but I already spoiled this for everybody but it's kind of crazy. Watch. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9316.88s)]
*  Doesn't slow down for a second. Goes right through it which is definitely [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9322.8s)]
*  not good if you're running around where people try to put murals in front of the road and they [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9330.96s)]
*  know that you're going to be driving by the Tesla but other than that it doesn't really come up. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9336.0s)]
*  For the most part though in the real world it works perfect. In the real world it's pretty incredible. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9340.24s)]
*  Like if you take it on the expressway? Oh yeah it changes lanes for you. Yeah it hits the blinkers [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9345.199999999999s)]
*  and changes lanes. It has cameras everywhere so it knows where everything is at all times. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9350.08s)]
*  I can tell and I've had it. I've had three of them. This is my third one. So the first one I had was [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9354.16s)]
*  way back. When was Elon on the first time? 2018. So the difference between the one in 2018. The 2018 [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9359.84s)]
*  one basically just kind of stayed between the lines and drove itself and steered itself. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9368.48s)]
*  The new version of full self-driving is insane. It stops at stop signs. It lets people in if [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9374.0s)]
*  they're trying to merge. It slows down if there's something in front of you. It'll change lanes. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9380.560000000001s)]
*  Like it knows how to move traffic smoothly. It sees everything. It hits blinkers. Gets off the [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9385.12s)]
*  turnpike. Gets onto the side roads. It's incredible. You could summon it. If you're in a parking lot [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9391.52s)]
*  come to me and it pulls out of the parking lot and drives to you. It's nuts. It's the future. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9398.0s)]
*  It's just like we have to accept that. So what happens if you get in a wreck? That's a good [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9404.16s)]
*  question. Who's in trouble? Yeah. You sue Tesla? I think you're in trouble because you're always [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9410.24s)]
*  supposed to have your hand on the wheel. You're supposed to be paying attention. Always? Really? [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9415.04s)]
*  Yeah. You're not supposed to be kicking back with your hands behind your head. You're supposed to [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9417.76s)]
*  have your hands and your eyes on the road. You're not supposed to be staring at your phone. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9422.16s)]
*  Then what's the point? Just to chill. You're just kind of like just barely holding on to the wheel. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9426.08s)]
*  You don't have to think as much. It does do that for you. It does do that. It alleviates this feeling [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9430.400000000001s)]
*  of being hyper alert while you're driving. Which is why people get road rage. That's what road rage [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9436.0s)]
*  comes from. Because you have to make split second decisions. So your brain is primed to make split [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9441.92s)]
*  second decisions because you're on the highway and you know you're going fast. That's what it is. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9447.2s)]
*  Someone gets in your lane and you just start yelling because it's like you're already at seven [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9452.48s)]
*  or eight. You're not at a good baseline because you're in a car going 65 miles an hour. You should [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9456.88s)]
*  be alert. The Tesla alleviates a little bit of that. But at what cost? I won't get one because [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9462.16s)]
*  I know I'm going to run out of battery juice. That's the way I am. Oh, are you one of those people? [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9469.84s)]
*  I'm always on the verge of running out of gas. So I will not get a Tesla. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9476.0s)]
*  Yeah, the charging is a pain in the butt. Like the fact that it takes a while in comparison to [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9480.88s)]
*  pumping gas. But the plus side is if you just drive it as a commuter thing, you just plug it [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9486.88s)]
*  into your house. And that's so easy to do. And then you never have to go to the gas station again. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9492.32s)]
*  Here and there. A second car maybe. Well, I mean, I think in the future they're probably all going to [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9496.72s)]
*  be electric. Or some new fuel source. I heard that Porsche is working on some fuel source [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9503.2s)]
*  that is different than just standard gasoline. And it has like insanely low emissions. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9509.519999999999s)]
*  See if you can find that. I think it's like negligible difference in the exhaust fumes. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9518.48s)]
*  But it's not, I don't think it's like standard gasoline. I don't think it's a standard engine. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9525.279999999999s)]
*  I think it's something different. So this is something they're working on now, which probably [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9529.519999999999s)]
*  would be good to keep that creepy oil business alive forever, which they definitely want to do. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9534.72s)]
*  How many did you say is it? Porsche? Yeah, Porsche's alternative fuel. I mean, that's the [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9539.6s)]
*  that's the elephant in the room. Like everything needs gas. Everything. Like this idea, we got to [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9546.56s)]
*  get off petroleum products. Okay, like when? Yeah, everything. Everything's made with oil. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9554.48s)]
*  We are a petroleum based society. We got so much of that stuff. We use it for everything. All your [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9560.4s)]
*  plastics. E-fuel? Is that what it's called? Is that it? I think that's it. What does it say about it? [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9566.32s)]
*  Porsche's synthetic fuel. A green kind of gasoline to save internal combustion engines. Yeah, so this [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9574.0s)]
*  is it. Similar to gasoline, but produced in a much greener way. E-fuel. I don't like it already. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9579.92s)]
*  The marketing of red flags are up. I don't like it. I don't like it. Yes, you're reading that right. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9586.32s)]
*  E-fuel is close to gasoline in its use, yet its production is much more environmentally friendly. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9592.0s)]
*  How is this possible? Thanks to two main ingredients, water and carbon dioxide, [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9596.56s)]
*  as well as the method to produce the greener fuel! This is like they're talking to a kid. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9600.4s)]
*  The process is relatively simple. First step is electrolysis of water, splitting it into two [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9605.68s)]
*  its two components, hydrogen and oxygen gases. In partnership with Simon's Energy, Porsche [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9612.56s)]
*  simultaneously captures the carbon dioxide directly from the air and combines it with the hydrogen [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9618.640000000001s)]
*  produced to synthesize methanol. The resulting synthetic methanol can then be used in Exxon [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9623.44s)]
*  Mobile's methanol to gasoline process. The end result is that the fuel obtained meets the same [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9630.32s)]
*  high standards followed by all gasoline types currently. Here with ecological fuel, we're far [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9635.68s)]
*  from the conventional process for the extraction and transformation of oil into gasoline! [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9642.16s)]
*  But does this change the output? It seems like they're saying it changes [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9648.24s)]
*  that it's the same. Oh, okay. 85% reduction of CO2 emissions. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9652.16s)]
*  Since good news never comes along, Porsche is planning to use the renewable... scroll to the [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9658.56s)]
*  side... renewable sources of electricity for the electrolysis. Okay. Well, it seems like [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9664.0s)]
*  this is their push to keep combustion engines, because that's the number one problem that car [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9674.48s)]
*  enthusiasts have. There's two problems that they have right now with electric cars. One of them is [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9681.36s)]
*  reseal. People do not want to use electric cars. Super hard to sell them. And they lose an enormous [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9685.12s)]
*  amount of their value. I think if you buy one of those Porsche Taycans, those beautiful Porsche [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9691.6s)]
*  electric cars they make, in two years it's like 50% drop in what it's worth. Or close to it. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9697.44s)]
*  Why? Are there maintenance issues with them? People don't want used electric cars because [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9704.0s)]
*  they know the battery's degrade. And replacing the batteries is a nightmare right now. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9707.52s)]
*  It's like they're tweeners. The tech is amazing. Driving them is incredible. It's instantaneous [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9711.92s)]
*  acceleration. They're amazing. The Porsche one is fantastic. Same as the Model S. The driving [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9718.64s)]
*  them makes other cars feel so stupid. But the problem is reselling them. You lose a lot of [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9724.8s)]
*  value in it. As opposed to like, if you buy something like a BMW. Say you buy a BMW M3 and [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9731.279999999999s)]
*  then you want to get rid of it in two years. It doesn't lose much value. It's still a really [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9740.08s)]
*  valuable car that people want. Because it probably will behave the exact same way as the day you [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9743.76s)]
*  drove it off the lot. But you can get it now for cheaper. A little cheaper. But not a lot cheaper. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9748.24s)]
*  But not with these e-cars. Which is kind of crazy. A buddy of mine's kid got an Audi. Like this sick [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9753.36s)]
*  Audi, I think it's called the e-tron. He got it for like $60,000. It was like a $120,000 car a [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9759.28s)]
*  couple years ago. Yeah, so that's an issue. But how long are the batteries supposed to last? [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9765.039999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. You know, they slowly degrade over time. And I don't think there's [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9771.6s)]
*  anything you can do to stop that. I think that's just... Kind of like your iPhone. Yeah. Well, [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9777.6s)]
*  your iPhone's even worse. Because it's kind of engineered to do that. Once they move up the [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9782.4s)]
*  operating system and bring in the new phones. I'm holding out. I need to replace mine now. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9786.4s)]
*  I know the thing is, if you don't have that blue bubble, people think you're poor. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9793.52s)]
*  Or they think you're a dummy. It does bother me when I get the green. I know. It really bothers me. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9797.2s)]
*  It's a Psi-Op. It really is a Psi-Op. They got us with that. Well, especially with this technology [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9801.76s)]
*  exists. That's the advancement past Pegasus. It doesn't matter if your stuff's encrypted. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9807.919999999998s)]
*  It really doesn't matter. It seems like it doesn't matter. If someone wants to read it, [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9813.439999999999s)]
*  someone in a high position of power wants to read it. And regular hackers, are they really [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9817.519999999999s)]
*  hacking into your phone? What's going on? Yeah. I just assume... I'm just not going to send a [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9821.839999999998s)]
*  text message that I don't want the world to see. Yes. That's the best assumption. That's the best [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9825.679999999998s)]
*  assumption. Yeah. Just assume that someone is definitely watching everything you do all the time. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9830.48s)]
*  At the very least, the government's storing it somewhere in case they need to come after you. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9835.92s)]
*  Which is so weird that they're the people we pay. It's like you're paying the people that are [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9841.44s)]
*  restricting your rights. Okay. And you have to, because if you don't, they lock you up. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9847.28s)]
*  I wouldn't have guessed it, but for the pandemic. Yeah. I already asked you whether or not [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9851.76s)]
*  you were a different person at the end of this. Yeah. I mean, yes and no. Yeah. I was pretty shy. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9860.4s)]
*  Growing up, I was very shy and really hated public speaking. You would never guess. For real. You're [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9877.28s)]
*  so good at it. It's crazy. I still don't like it. For me to do that press conference, [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9885.52s)]
*  I must've been just on some sort of... I feel like I've grown that I can do things now that [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9890.16s)]
*  I never thought I could do. That makes me very happy. Yeah. It's been a journey, but I'm hoping [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9899.28s)]
*  it gets a little easier now. Yeah. I'm hoping it gets easier too. But I think the more people [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9907.68s)]
*  hear your story, the more public outraged they'll be and the more people will just wake up and [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9912.96s)]
*  realize that not everybody has your best interests in mind, unfortunately. And you got to kind of [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9919.119999999999s)]
*  hold people accountable because if you don't, they're going to keep, they'll ratchet it up even [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9925.039999999999s)]
*  further and further. Well, thank you for continuing to talk about it. And I know I've been watching [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9929.439999999999s)]
*  all of your podcasts recently and you bring it up a lot. So I think it's a festering wound for [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9933.679999999998s)]
*  people. And it really impacted everybody and we cannot sweep it under the rug. And we need the new [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9939.52s)]
*  administration to step up and do something because they have 500 mRNA shots in the pipeline. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9946.16s)]
*  33 of those are self-amplifying, which is just really terrifying. What does that mean? Meaning [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9956.32s)]
*  they're designed to continue to replicate indefinitely. I mean, already the ones we [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9962.32s)]
*  have, we don't have an off switch and this is like no off switch on steroids. They have them in Japan [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9967.28s)]
*  and India and the EU already. They've already given them to people? I don't know. I know they've [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9974.720000000001s)]
*  passed. The one that I think is in the pipeline in the US is for the H1N1. So it may not really [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9982.720000000001s)]
*  even get used unless there's an issue, but they're still playing around with it. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9992.96s)]
*  Self-replicating sounds terrifying. Especially when you just highlighted all those other problems [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=9997.679999999998s)]
*  with like DNA being introduced, lipid nanoparticles getting past the cell wall. All of it is just nuts. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10004.08s)]
*  So we have to keep fighting. Yeah, it's hard to believe it's true. It really is. It's hard to [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10014.0s)]
*  believe that all this that you just said is true. I think the thing that shocked me the most is the [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10019.68s)]
*  euthanizing people. Yeah, that's unfortunate. But yeah, the hospital, what happened in the hospitals [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10024.720000000001s)]
*  doesn't really get enough attention. But yeah, people were, oh, this should give some people hope. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10031.92s)]
*  There are two open criminal investigations from county district attorneys in two different states [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10039.76s)]
*  looking into the hospitals, trying to indict them. I mean, it hasn't happened yet. It may not happen, [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10046.08s)]
*  but it gives me hope that at least these people were sent to the hospital and trapped, isolated, [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10052.4s)]
*  informed consent, thrown out the window. Basically, given these protocols that were not effective [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10058.96s)]
*  and treated like prisoners, and then they have no recourse. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10069.039999999999s)]
*  And so many people die. I mean, basically that situation with the patient who I fought to try [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10073.039999999999s)]
*  to get ivermectin, very basic, why would the hospital not just give him a chance? Right? [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10079.84s)]
*  They basically had given up on him. Why would you not let somebody try ivermectin other than just evil? [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10086.08s)]
*  So there's hope that we may get some progress in that situation. But yeah, what happened in the [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10094.08s)]
*  hospital is really bad. And the ventilators. Yeah, the ventilators. With no acknowledgement of why [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10102.640000000001s)]
*  they stopped prescribing them to everybody. I can see initially, because like I said, [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10110.48s)]
*  if somebody showed up in my office with a really low oxygen saturation before I knew any better, [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10114.16s)]
*  I would have freaked out and called the ambulance. And once I realized that once I got through that, [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10119.519999999999s)]
*  I was going to force to, then I learned, yeah, you don't need to ventilate. You don't look at [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10125.68s)]
*  a number to put somebody on a ventilator. And unfortunately, the people in the hospital didn't [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10131.359999999999s)]
*  learn. They didn't experiment in that fashion. They just went by this protocol and just [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10138.16s)]
*  automatically put people on ventilators. They also didn't give people breathing treatments. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10143.119999999999s)]
*  They thought that breathing treatments would spread the virus. Breathing treatments were [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10147.2s)]
*  invaluable. What are breathing treatments exactly? So it's a little, it's not a big deal. It's a [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10151.6s)]
*  little machine with a tube. The tube connects to a mask. The mask has a cup. You put the medicine [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10158.880000000001s)]
*  in the cup. The pressurized air distributes the medicine as an aerosol that you inhale. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10165.52s)]
*  What kind of medicine? Budesonite is what we use, which is a steroid. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10172.160000000002s)]
*  And yeah, I used to do breathing treatments in my office. And then I moved them to people's cars [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10177.52s)]
*  because there was so much, oh, you're spreading the virus if you do breathing treatments in your [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10183.04s)]
*  office. But they weren't doing them in the hospital because they thought it would spread the virus. But [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10187.44s)]
*  super effective. I don't know if you've heard of Richard Bartlett. He's a doctor in Texas. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10192.880000000001s)]
*  He kind of got completely smeared for advocating for breathing treatments early on. He got [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10197.84s)]
*  pursued by the Texas Medical Board, pursued him because he was claiming they thought he was making [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10204.0s)]
*  false claims about Budesonite breathing treatments. But they were invaluable. I mean, all my high risk [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10209.84s)]
*  patients, I recommended they get those very low risk of issues with it. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10216.08s)]
*  Just when I thought we were done, that's even worse. That's one of the worst ones. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10224.8s)]
*  Why would you stop that? Why would you want to stop people from doing that? [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10230.56s)]
*  They, well, they claimed that you're spreading the virus. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10234.16s)]
*  I just think it's just such a hard truth to swallow is that they wanted to suppress [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10240.0s)]
*  as many treatments as possible. That's a hard truth to swallow. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10244.96s)]
*  Part partially out of ignorance, laziness, some of them out of evil. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10251.04s)]
*  Oh, thank you. Thank you for exposing this and sticking your neck out and becoming the person you [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10256.56s)]
*  are today through all this craziness. I really enjoyed talking to you. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10262.8s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10266.4s)]
*  You have a lot of courage. You really do. I hope you get through this as a winner. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10267.2s)]
*  Thank you. All right. Bye, everybody. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10271.52s)]
*  Okay. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7BIqXQZns&t=10286.16s)]
