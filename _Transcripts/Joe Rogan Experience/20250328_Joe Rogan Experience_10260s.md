# Joe Rogan Experience #2296 - Big Jay Oakerson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6.0s)]
*  Big J. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10.0s)]
*  What's happening? Hell yeah. You went with the three nose rings now. You're getting crazy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting carried away. I went to go, I had a cold and I think I blew my nose one of them out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=22.0s)]
*  So then I went to go get it re-put back in and I was like, throw another one in there while you're at it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=28.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm just me fighting age, I think. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=33.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=34.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=35.0s)]
*  There's something weird when you're fighting age. Like you know you're doing it but you can't help it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=36.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, absolutely. Like when people make fun of the way I dress or whatever, coloring my hair, my piercings. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=40.0s)]
*  And they're always like, is it going to change at some point? And I am hitting an age where I'm like, I can't just do a hard shift one day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=47.0s)]
*  But it is funny to think like, I can't see myself at 65 doing some of the stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=54.0s)]
*  Why not? Who gives a shit? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=61.0s)]
*  You can, but it's also like, I feel if I saw it, I'd have a million and one jokes about it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=63.0s)]
*  But it's still at the end of the day, you're like, I'd walk out and go, oh, I forgot my pocket scarf. I gotta go back upstairs. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=68.0s)]
*  As long as you're still funny, you can pull it off. But when you're bombing with red hair and three nose rings. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=76.0s)]
*  Shit, that's true. It becomes an issue. As long as you stay funny. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=83.0s)]
*  That's why I think when I first started, I tried to blend in whatever I was. I started in a black circuit, so like I had so much fubu shit on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=87.0s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=93.0s)]
*  And just like yeah, jerseys and stuff. So I definitely played it up. The funniest was having a big silver chain with a cross and I'm Jewish. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=94.0s)]
*  But I just really was like, I think they'll like me more if I have a cross. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=102.0s)]
*  When I first started, I thought you had to dress like those guys on Evening at the Improv. So I got a blazer and I rolled the sleeves up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=105.0s)]
*  And I had like a wacky t-shirt that I wore. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=111.0s)]
*  The costume? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, the costume. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=114.0s)]
*  Have a button on your blazer. Some wacky button. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=115.0s)]
*  I watched all those shows growing up, Evening at the Improv, Caroline's Comedy Hour. The evolution of comedy is insane. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=118.0s)]
*  It's pretty insane. Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=125.0s)]
*  The evolution of, just like the fact that these guys, I watched, like always laugh and go back, Bill Kirshenbauer. Do you know that? That was the guy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=126.0s)]
*  I don't remember him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=134.0s)]
*  He played, he was the coach on a sitcom. He got a sitcom called Just the Ten of Us where he had like eight kids or something. He was like a coach. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=135.0s)]
*  It was a spin-off show of some sort, but he was just like a zany comic. He would go on stage and he was just loud and weird. Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=142.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=149.0s)]
*  But these were the guys who made the rounds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=151.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=153.0s)]
*  Monologists. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's almost like their act just got them to a sitcom. Like that was a real strategy back then. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=156.0s)]
*  You had an act that could get you to a sitcom. That's all everybody wanted. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=162.0s)]
*  When I did New Faces at Montreal, my manager at the time, terrible, just gave me, I mean, he was just pushing the old advice. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=166.0s)]
*  He was like, everything was like, don't be yourself at all. Like write a set that's going to be, what's your sitcom basically? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=175.0s)]
*  And dress, you know, a certain kind of, would dress like for stage. I don't know what I was, I didn't know how to like, what he meant in nice clothes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=183.0s)]
*  So I had like black loafers and straight leg, like dark blue dungarees. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=191.0s)]
*  And like a short sleeve button down shirt. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=196.0s)]
*  I'm just picturing you and black loafers on. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=200.0s)]
*  And a short sleeve like blue button down shirt. It looked ridiculous. And it was so dramatic. It's also funny too, doing it as long as I have now, 27 years I think I'm doing it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=202.0s)]
*  Like the hilarious like fake emotion you put into things. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=214.0s)]
*  I remember having my daughter was a baby when I did New Faces and talking to the picture backstage before I went on stage. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=218.0s)]
*  We're going to go do it. And then had a mediocre set. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=225.0s)]
*  And all I got from New Faces was like a MTV two talking head one off. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=228.0s)]
*  Like what were they thinking? What were they wearing? MTV two presents. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=232.0s)]
*  You remember those things where you would just start talking shit about people. That's it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they would they just clip it up. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=240.0s)]
*  They took they wouldn't. I did a couple of them. They didn't air most of it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=242.0s)]
*  And the one I always remember because when I would go back to MTV for anything, they would always be like we still pass the like the segment around of you doing that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=247.0s)]
*  What were they thinking? Yeah. And it was Fiona Apple on an award show years ago to accept her award. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=255.0s)]
*  She got there and started quoting the great Maya Angelou or something. And I was like, Maya Angelou. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=261.0s)]
*  I was like, what is she talking about Maya Angelou? Look, we all loved her as Weezy Jefferson. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=266.0s)]
*  I enjoy her pancake syrup. But and then they were like, yo, you can't call Maya Angelou Aunt Jemima. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=271.0s)]
*  I'm kidding. I'm kidding, though. I know Maya Angelou. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=278.0s)]
*  Wasn't it funny that they took Aunt Jemima off of Aunt Jemima? But that was actually a lady who was an entrepreneur. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they just could get rid of it because no one's paying attention to why. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=288.0s)]
*  They just decided that Aunt Jemima was racist. Uncle Ben. But that's true, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=292.0s)]
*  I mean, this this is not a tick tock myth, is it? Make sure that's true. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=299.0s)]
*  And I might about I got my mighty got fooled by tick tock. I should say reels because I'm not really on tick tock. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=303.0s)]
*  Whether or not Aunt Jemima was a real entrepreneur. I'm pretty sure it's true. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=309.0s)]
*  I think I think it's based on a real woman. And I think she just was like an awesome cook and put together some fucking pancakes and great pancakes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lady, Nancy Green, it says. Oh, so her name wasn't Jemima. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=324.0s)]
*  But there that's the real lady. I mean, this is the first ads, I guess. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=329.0s)]
*  You could tell me that you can tell me. Hold up, hold up, hold up. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=333.0s)]
*  Look at this. Look at this. Eyes in town, honey. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=338.0s)]
*  OK, all arguments are out the window. Eyes in town, honey. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=344.0s)]
*  OK, unless you are an actual black person saying that you can't write that down. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=349.0s)]
*  Like, you know, that was some fucking egghead advertising executive to put that together. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=355.0s)]
*  And then the poor guy, the poor guy, the printing press had to keep double checking. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=361.0s)]
*  He's like, are you sure we're going to do this? I apostrophe s. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=364.0s)]
*  OK, yes, it's how they speak. Oh, I don't know, man. Oh, bro. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=369.0s)]
*  I don't want to get involved in this. Oh, damn, that was a crazy picture. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=375.0s)]
*  I just saw I went to a that's so crazy. I was looking at an art gallery in Philly recently that had like a Dr. Seuss exhibit at it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=379.0s)]
*  And I forgot that Dr. Seuss had all those like crazy racist drawings and stuff. Right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=387.0s)]
*  What were they? What were they? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=391.0s)]
*  It was just like, you know, a hunter, like with like a savage with like giant lips and stuff like that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=393.0s)]
*  That's right. You know, it's like the most crazy racist shit that caught me off guard was R. Crumb. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=399.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, R. Crumb, the like 70s sort of psychedelic comic book guy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=405.0s)]
*  He was very popular when I was a kid living in San Francisco and when I was an artist. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=411.0s)]
*  And I was like, I used to love his talk because like, God, this guy's so weird. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=416.0s)]
*  And then I saw some of the like the super racist ones and you're like, yo, what the fuck? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=419.0s)]
*  It really is. The explanation is like, yeah, it's a different time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=427.0s)]
*  So he had some just weird shit, man, like you like riding on giant women. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=431.0s)]
*  You ever see the documentary they did on him? No, but I know what it is. Yeah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=436.0s)]
*  It's very interesting. It's because his brother is super weird and his mother is super weird. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=441.0s)]
*  And, you know, here's this guy like wearing a tie and he's real pervert. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=448.0s)]
*  And he's like openly a pervert, but like a brilliant artist. That's great. Yeah. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=452.0s)]
*  Really fascinating. I've heard of it before. It is amazing though. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=457.0s)]
*  I was went to a musician, a musician's house for New Year's Eve when I first moved to New York. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=460.0s)]
*  So 20 some years ago. And he just invited me and Kurt Metzger. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=467.0s)]
*  And we went to his apartment and it was covered in like Sambo paintings, like real. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=471.0s)]
*  Oh, geez. There's like black people at the party. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=478.0s)]
*  It was just like, yeah, it's art. And I'm like, I don't know if I'd cover my house and something I do explain every one of them to people. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=481.0s)]
*  I go, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. You have a lot of choices. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=487.0s)]
*  You could have puppies, flowers. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=492.0s)]
*  Flowers. I see. It's so funny when someone makes strong decisions if they change their ways. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=494.0s)]
*  I used to drive strippers to bachelor parties to be the bouncer with zero skills to handle that whatsoever. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=499.0s)]
*  I took the job as like fat kid that wanted to see naked girls for free. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=507.0s)]
*  And I ended up at a bachelor party with two brothers. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=510.0s)]
*  It was one of the brothers thing and he was covered in like swastika tattoos and all kinds of crazy shit. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=513.0s)]
*  And the strippers were not both white for sure. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=519.0s)]
*  But there's also black people this party and stuff like that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=522.0s)]
*  And I don't know the explanation these guys have to give. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=525.0s)]
*  But I talked to one of their black friends and was like, hey, is it weird to ask? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=528.0s)]
*  But like these guys are all covered in like swastika and racist tattoos. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=532.0s)]
*  And they were like, oh, yeah, they just got caught up in some bullshit when they were teenagers. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=536.0s)]
*  They're good dudes. Like, wow. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=540.0s)]
*  And they're still wearing short sleeve shirts. Huh? That seems strange. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=543.0s)]
*  You think these guys would be in like wearing Tarell Owens body suits like to cover that up. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=546.0s)]
*  It's like one of the arguments why you shouldn't be able to get a tattoo until you're 25. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=550.0s)]
*  Is that when the brain's fully formed? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=554.0s)]
*  Yeah, when you're a boy, your brain's women mature younger. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=556.0s)]
*  But when you're a boy, your brain is fully formed at 25. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=559.0s)]
*  We're able to make solid decisions. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=562.0s)]
*  What decisions do girls make for tattoos that are that great? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=564.0s)]
*  Very few swastikas. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=566.0s)]
*  Very few swastikas. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=568.0s)]
*  What are the numbers of swastikas on girls versus on dudes? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=569.0s)]
*  If we could Google that, please. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=572.0s)]
*  What percentage? Like what percentage? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=575.0s)]
*  I think it's just that one girl, the character that Fyrouza Balk played in American History X. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=577.0s)]
*  Did you? I just read a thing recently. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=582.0s)]
*  This made me laugh so hard. You know, this movie, American History X. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=584.0s)]
*  Yes, I remember that movie. That movie was crazy. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=587.0s)]
*  Great movie. Crazy movie. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=589.0s)]
*  Ending is such a question mark on it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=591.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=593.0s)]
*  And if you recall, like, you know, he goes to prison, he reforms himself. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=595.0s)]
*  He comes out, he tries to get his brother out of that mindset of being a white supremist. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=599.0s)]
*  And then he succeeds basically in telling him the story of what happened to him in jail. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=604.0s)]
*  And then the next day he walks his brother to school. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=609.0s)]
*  His brother gets killed by a black kid, shoots him in the chest, and he dies. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=611.0s)]
*  And then he goes in to save him. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=615.0s)]
*  Or he goes in there and just cries, screaming like, what have I done? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=617.0s)]
*  You know, his brother's dead now. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=620.0s)]
*  And then they end the movie. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=622.0s)]
*  The director, who apparently was a lunatic, him and Edward Norton like fought the whole time. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=623.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=627.0s)]
*  Over like how the movie should go. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=628.0s)]
*  But the director's ending he wanted to do was after the brother gets shot by the black kid, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=629.0s)]
*  they were going to show Edward Norton in the mirror and then with the big swastika tattoo on him. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=636.0s)]
*  And then he was going to smirk in the mirror and walk off. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=640.0s)]
*  I was like, they should have played back in black after that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=643.0s)]
*  He's back. And he's racister than ever. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=645.0s)]
*  I was almost going to get it removed. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=650.0s)]
*  Just imagine being... [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=654.0s)]
*  Smiling in a Mickey Mouse. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=655.0s)]
*  Like a Schwarzenegger movie ending to American History X. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=657.0s)]
*  That is so crazy that he wanted to do that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=660.0s)]
*  I mean, not the song, but that is... [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=663.0s)]
*  They should have played the song. Yeah, the image of smirking. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=665.0s)]
*  The song would have been... everybody would have been so mad. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=668.0s)]
*  Can you imagine if you cheesed it up just at the end? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=671.0s)]
*  Like you have this brilliant movie and at the end just total cheeseball, curveball ending. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=673.0s)]
*  Oh, man. I remember taking a date to go see... [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=678.0s)]
*  There was a girl I lost my virginity to who was a little bit older than me [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=683.0s)]
*  and a very hippie-dippie girl. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=686.0s)]
*  And we went to go see... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=689.0s)]
*  What the fuck was the movie? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=691.0s)]
*  It was a John Singleton movie. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=694.0s)]
*  Boys in the Hood? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=696.0s)]
*  No, no, no. It was the one on the school campus. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=697.0s)]
*  Why am I blanking on it? Omar Epps was in it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=701.0s)]
*  Tyra Banks was in it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=703.0s)]
*  Michael Rapaport was great in it. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=705.0s)]
*  Higher Learning. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=707.0s)]
*  I took this girl to see Higher Learning. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=708.0s)]
*  The movie is great. At the end of the movie, Michael Rapaport goes crazy. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=711.0s)]
*  He gets roped into being a white supremist with the skinhead group on campus. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=716.0s)]
*  Never seen that. These guys were hardcore on-campus skinheads. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=721.0s)]
*  But they still got loans. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=726.0s)]
*  It's a science fiction movie. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=728.0s)]
*  They're like, white power. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=731.0s)]
*  All right. I got social studies in a few minutes. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=732.0s)]
*  On campus. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=735.0s)]
*  I got to go. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=736.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=737.0s)]
*  Hey, can you finish nailing these crosses together? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=738.0s)]
*  What year is this? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=740.0s)]
*  95. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=741.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=742.0s)]
*  Yeah, right when I graduated high school. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=743.0s)]
*  I take her to see this movie. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=745.0s)]
*  The movie is Michael Rapaport joins the skinhead group. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=747.0s)]
*  Black people on this campus. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=752.0s)]
*  A lot of things. There's a black party going on. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=754.0s)]
*  I think a white kid tried to rape a girl, Christy Swanson. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=756.0s)]
*  Then all the black guys go to help and beat up the kid who raped her. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=761.0s)]
*  Then the cops, of course, come and get mad at the black people and save the rapist. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=765.0s)]
*  Then Michael Rapaport goes nuts, goes on top of the school and starts picking off black people. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=769.0s)]
*  In a 90-minute arc. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=775.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Starts picking off black people. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=777.0s)]
*  One of them kills Omar Epps' girlfriend, Tyra Banks. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=780.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=783.0s)]
*  And then he gets into a fight. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=784.0s)]
*  Omar Epps and him get into a fist fight. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=786.0s)]
*  And then the cops break it up, start beating the shit out of Omar Epps. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=788.0s)]
*  And then Michael Rapaport pulls a gun out on the cops when they're trying to stop him. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=792.0s)]
*  The scene's trying to keep the situation calm so nothing more crazy happens. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=798.0s)]
*  But they're going like, it's okay, son. Everything's gonna be okay. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=802.0s)]
*  While he's holding the gun. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=806.0s)]
*  And then Michael Rapaport kills himself. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=808.0s)]
*  That's how that ends. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=811.0s)]
*  And then at the end there's a concert happening. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=813.0s)]
*  And they just put the word unlearn across the screen. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=815.0s)]
*  And you can just hear black people in the audience go, what the fuck? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=819.0s)]
*  And I was like, yo, let's go. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=823.0s)]
*  Let's go. And she was like, what? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=825.0s)]
*  And I was like, no, no, no. Let's go. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=827.0s)]
*  Do not let these credits start. Let's get in the car. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=829.0s)]
*  And I mean, I don't know how bad it got out there, but it was a yelling, a lot of yelling. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=831.0s)]
*  It was an inflammatory movie. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=836.0s)]
*  There's no point in a movie where a white person got their due. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=838.0s)]
*  It was always like a white person fucks over black people. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=842.0s)]
*  And then the cops are like, you're fine. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=845.0s)]
*  Hey, shit happens, man. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=848.0s)]
*  You can make a movie like that before the internet. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=850.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=852.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=854.0s)]
*  Yeah, because there wouldn't be a million signature proof that this shouldn't be a thing or whatever. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=855.0s)]
*  Well, it was also preposterous, like patently preposterous. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=862.0s)]
*  Just to argue it? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=866.0s)]
*  Well, if you're pretending there's a white power group on a college campus, how about ever? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=867.0s)]
*  Ever? Like, this is crazy. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=872.0s)]
*  You found the one that used to study, the one college that has a white power group in it, and like, open, openly. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=874.0s)]
*  Openly. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=880.0s)]
*  What? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=881.0s)]
*  You found tattoos out? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=882.0s)]
*  And all the cops are openly racist. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=884.0s)]
*  Like, not just like there's a racist cop, just like there's a racist fucking postman. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=886.0s)]
*  There's racist everything. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=890.0s)]
*  There's a racist dentist out there somewhere. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=892.0s)]
*  Yeah, but no, they make it like that at today's meetings, like, alright, let's round up some blacks, make sure these whites are okay. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=894.0s)]
*  So crazy. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=899.0s)]
*  So crazy you could make a movie like that. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=901.0s)]
*  I think you'd still be that kind of inflammatory. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=903.0s)]
*  They'd go for it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=905.0s)]
*  I just watched that adolescence thing, which I thought was a... [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=906.0s)]
*  It was adolescence. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=909.0s)]
*  It's this new, it's a four-part mini-series on Netflix. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=910.0s)]
*  It's British. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=915.0s)]
*  I'm, like, I watch things so open-minded and just looking to be entertained that I miss messages a lot. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=916.0s)]
*  But by the third episode, I realized it's about a little boy gets immediately accused of, it's how it starts, of killing a classmate. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=923.0s)]
*  And he's getting arrested. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=932.0s)]
*  Each episode is one shot to make it like a play. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=933.0s)]
*  And the acting is unbelievable. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=936.0s)]
*  But what it whittles down to, it's apparently like a, from the videos I watched beyond, like this show Explained, because I look at all those, and it was like an anti-toxic masculinity message. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=938.0s)]
*  And the idea was just like the kids watched porn and his dad's a tough guy, so that's why he thought he could kill a woman, or why he could kill a girl. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=951.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=961.0s)]
*  And they shout out, and again, I don't know a lot of this guy's stuff other than the basic idea, but they shout out Andrew Tate in it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=962.0s)]
*  When I heard that name, I was like, oh, that's what this is. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=968.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=971.0s)]
*  There is, that could be a real guy. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=972.0s)]
*  Like, that's less preposterous than the white power group on campus. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=975.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, no doubt. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=979.0s)]
*  There's kids that get radicalized. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=980.0s)]
*  They get an evil parent who, you know, who fucking... [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=981.0s)]
*  They didn't really make it that that was evil. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=985.0s)]
*  They were making it more like the porn and like the idea that like, that mom should be in line and cooking. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=986.0s)]
*  There's guys who grow up without a mom. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=992.0s)]
*  Those guys can definitely, if they have a shitty dad and no mom, those guys could definitely be, and if you have a psycho in your DNA. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=994.0s)]

*  I had my little dad, lots of mom, just tendencies when I was, my step-pop man. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1061.0s)]
*  He swooped in and saved my ass from really being as twirly as possible without being into cocks. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1066.0s)]
*  I mean, I was right there praying for the take and I'm sitting there laying on my tummy as a kid watching Falcon Crest in Dallas with my mom. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1078.0s)]
*  That's what I know Lorenzo Lama's from. Falcon Crest, not Renegade like everybody else. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1089.0s)]
*  Was Renegade the one where he was the karate guy? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1094.0s)]
*  He was the karate guy, but he was sent, he was a bounty hunter. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1096.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1101.0s)]
*  On a motorcycle. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1102.0s)]
*  But wasn't he like a karate guy too? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1103.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1104.0s)]
*  I'm not making that up. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1105.0s)]
*  Well, no, no, he would fight his fights with karate. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1106.0s)]
*  That guy was so beautiful. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1108.0s)]
*  He was gorgeous. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1110.0s)]
*  So handsome. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1111.0s)]
*  I know, it really is the sadness of a guy that handsome because he got a girl that was smoking hot and then, was it Shawna Sand? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1112.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1119.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1120.0s)]
*  Look at that hand. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1121.0s)]
*  I think he married Shawna Sand, was like a playboy girl. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1122.0s)]
*  And then they break up and she gets crazy surgery. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1125.0s)]
*  She looks like a lunatic. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1128.0s)]
*  She starts doing porn. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1129.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1130.0s)]
*  And he still looks pretty great. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1133.0s)]
*  He's had a ton of fucking series, those weird series that you like flip through in the middle of the night like he's a motorcycle detective or something. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1137.0s)]
*  It's like there's a bunch of those. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1144.0s)]
*  How many series? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1146.0s)]
*  He's one of those guys that like always has a series. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1147.0s)]
*  I mean, the alliteration of the name, he was handsome, it was all kind of perfect. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1150.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1153.0s)]
*  Does he have the hair anymore? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1154.0s)]
*  Does he keep the long hair? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1155.0s)]
*  No, there's no way. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1156.0s)]
*  Because he's still rocking like Fabio still rocks it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1157.0s)]
*  He's not letting go. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1160.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1161.0s)]
*  Respect. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1162.0s)]
*  Now see, he's got short hair. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1163.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1164.0s)]
*  Even older with white hair, handsome as fuck. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1165.0s)]
*  But I mean comparatively too, if you look at the ex that was like his holy shit wife. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1167.0s)]
*  She fell apart. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1172.0s)]
*  They all fall apart. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1173.0s)]
*  That surgery is a crazy way to go because you can't see what you look like. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1174.0s)]
*  It's like anorexics or bodybuilders. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1178.0s)]
*  You get dysmorphia. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1180.0s)]
*  Your brain starts playing tricks on you and you think your lips aren't big enough and your tits aren't big enough and your face is, you know, like there's some skin on the side of your ears. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1182.0s)]
*  You can pull it back and you tuck this and pull that and your ass would stick out more if they put the implants in. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1190.0s)]
*  And that would probably get me a better a better guy. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1195.0s)]
*  I get a fat ass. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1198.0s)]
*  I always say if I crowdsource it, if the audience will pay for it, I'll get a fat ass. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1199.0s)]
*  Let's find out what they do because I'm bewildered. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1204.0s)]
*  So I know that there's an operation where they take fat out of other parts of your body and they stuff it in your ass and your ass looks like a bag of cheese. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1206.0s)]
*  There's bad ones. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1213.0s)]
*  Maybe there's good ones. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1215.0s)]
*  Maybe there's good ones. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1216.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm being judgmental. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1217.0s)]
*  There's probably a doctor out there. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1218.0s)]
*  Hey, I do it under the surface of the fat so that there's always a smooth area on top. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1219.0s)]
*  Some wizard with a BMW. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1224.0s)]
*  But at this point there are good breast implants. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1226.0s)]
*  At this point there are. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1229.0s)]
*  They exist. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1230.0s)]
*  Yes, they feel real. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1231.0s)]
*  But also they look real and they don't have like the where you have like the you know you see rib cage between them. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1233.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1238.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1239.0s)]
*  You are putting something that's similar to breast tissue where breast tissue would be. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1240.0s)]
*  So with this, your butt is a muscle. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1247.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1250.0s)]
*  You know, it's like muscle and fat. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1251.0s)]
*  A male. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1253.0s)]
*  Why did you say male, Jamie? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1254.0s)]
*  He's a male. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1255.0s)]
*  How dare you. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1256.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1257.0s)]
*  I like to retain anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of the fat that is initially transferred into the butt. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1258.0s)]
*  I like when they say butt like that. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1263.0s)]
*  I really think they're, you know, professional. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1265.0s)]
*  You're talking about surgery. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1268.0s)]
*  Into the glutes. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1270.0s)]
*  You're calling butt surgery. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1272.0s)]
*  What kind of a fucking doctor? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1273.0s)]
*  Let me see your diploma. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1274.0s)]
*  Now you're going to want to be gentle when you take a shit for the next three weeks. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1275.0s)]
*  The rest will be reabsorbed by the body over time. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1277.0s)]
*  The results you see immediately after surgery and in the weeks following are not permanent. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1281.0s)]
*  Around 90 days post-op, your butt will finally stabilize into its new shape and size. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1284.0s)]
*  The procedure itself is semi-permanent as opposed to permanent. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1292.0s)]
*  As your body responds to natural aging process and normal weight fluctuations, so too will your buttocks. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1295.0s)]
*  Depending on the precautions you take during your recovery and the lifespan you maintain in the time following, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1300.0s)]
*  your BBL may last several years to even decades. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1305.0s)]
*  I saw a dude at the mall the other day with a BBL. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1309.0s)]
*  For sure? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1311.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1312.0s)]
*  No way it's real. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1313.0s)]
*  Gay? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1314.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1315.0s)]
*  Super. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1316.0s)]
*  How dare you ask that? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1317.0s)]
*  Imagine if he wasn't a gay guy? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1318.0s)]
*  Imagine if straight guys started getting BBLs? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1320.0s)]
*  It has to exist. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1322.0s)]
*  It has to. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1323.0s)]
*  There's definitely a guy. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1324.0s)]
*  It's probably a whole website dedicated to normalizing straight guy BBLs. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1326.0s)]
*  Daddy makeover. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1331.0s)]
*  Daddy makeover. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1332.0s)]
*  Just lift weights you fucking pussy. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1334.0s)]
*  Just go to the gym and do the work. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1337.0s)]
*  Shut your mouth and stop it with your BBL. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1340.0s)]
*  And listen, I'll put it out there again, unless the crowd pays for it, I will get a fat ass. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1343.0s)]
*  Here's the thing, I think there's other ways to do it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1347.0s)]
*  This was my question, because I know there's an implant as well. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1350.0s)]
*  So there's butt implants, which is kind of even crazier, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1353.0s)]
*  because then you're taking the risk of having something, a foreign object in your ass where everyone's scared to get cancer. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1358.0s)]
*  Like if you're scared to get cancer, what's the place you're scared to get the cancer the most? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1364.0s)]
*  Ass. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1367.0s)]
*  Ass cancer. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1368.0s)]
*  You don't have to shit in a bag, you know? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1369.0s)]
*  So like you're thinking about these plastic things that you've inserted into the muscle tissue surrounding your, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1371.0s)]
*  what kind of inflammation is going to be caused by that? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1377.0s)]
*  What about the plastic leaching into your body as you're in the sauna? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1380.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1384.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a weird thing. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1386.0s)]
*  You know, I can't believe they still have perfected dick surgery, dick lengthening or thickening surgery. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1388.0s)]
*  But what's crazy is there are procedures and people get them. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1395.0s)]
*  I couldn't imagine getting a procedure that's been done like 30,000 times. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1399.0s)]
*  You don't want to be the first tonsillectomy, and that's like routine. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1404.0s)]
*  Isn't it kind of shocking that no one's figured out a way to make a bigger dick? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1410.0s)]
*  It's kind of shocking. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1413.0s)]
*  It is shocking, that's what I'm saying. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1414.0s)]
*  I'm surprised that hasn't been the thing. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1416.0s)]
*  There's the butt enlargement. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1417.0s)]
*  Intramuscular buttock implants. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1419.0s)]
*  When they say butt talk, I feel a little more comfortable. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1422.0s)]
*  I feel like these are real pros. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1424.0s)]
*  So you're going to take those plastic, what are those things made out of, Jamie? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1426.0s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1429.0s)]
*  Those ones are dirty. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1430.0s)]
*  They pulled them out of a butt. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1432.0s)]
*  Oh, they took them out. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1433.0s)]
*  He's a detransitioner. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1434.0s)]
*  Okay, so what does it say? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1437.0s)]
*  Butt augmentation is most commonly performed by fat injections, da da da da da da da. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1438.0s)]
*  While men can do like women, synthetic filters, fillers, oh, synthetic fillers, oh boy, and [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1445.0s)]
*  fat injections, they often are less tolerant to the procedures that require multiple treatments [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1458.0s)]
*  and whose effects are more modest. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1463.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1466.0s)]
*  They're often smaller and flatter buttocks, are more resistant to augmentation efforts [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1467.0s)]
*  with stronger intergluteal muscles and a thinner subcutaneous fat layer. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1472.0s)]
*  So he's saying I can do it to dudes but it's not going to come out good. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1478.0s)]
*  Isn't it crazy that the only real end game of this, because like what's the benefit in your life? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1481.0s)]
*  It's more dick. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1487.0s)]
*  But it's like money. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1488.0s)]
*  It's like ultimately it's like finding someone who's going to like your weird body more. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1490.0s)]
*  You think it's money for dudes? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1493.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, for dudes. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1495.0s)]
*  Yeah, these are dudes. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1496.0s)]
*  That's a dude. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1497.0s)]
*  Oh, that's just gay probably. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1498.0s)]
*  Gay as fuck. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1500.0s)]
*  Or maybe the guy was also crowdsourced and maybe they paid for it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1501.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1504.0s)]
*  It's just, yeah. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1505.0s)]
*  Solid, ultra soft, silicon buttock implants of 400cc were placed and a layered muscle and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1507.0s)]
*  incision closure done, no drains were used. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1515.0s)]
*  His long term results showed good improvement. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1518.0s)]
*  Scroll up, please. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1520.0s)]
*  His buttock size and shape is even probably better in that regard than I thought could occur. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1522.0s)]
*  Ew. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1528.0s)]
*  It looks fake. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1529.0s)]
*  Like there's a lump. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1530.0s)]
*  There's a lump where you have a tumor in your ass, sir. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1532.0s)]
*  Like look, there's like a little ridge where all of a sudden the implant is. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1534.0s)]
*  That's so weird that I'm staring at this guy's butt so long. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1538.0s)]
*  I just don't think it's the same guy. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1540.0s)]
*  It's the same guy. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1542.0s)]
*  I trust these people. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1543.0s)]
*  Why would the internet lie? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1544.0s)]
*  They're buttock people. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1546.0s)]
*  Why would the internet lie? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1547.0s)]
*  They wouldn't lie. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1548.0s)]
*  But the penis surgeries are like nutty from like cutting a tendon. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1549.0s)]
*  Yeah, to make it just poke out a little more. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1554.0s)]
*  And then there's other ones where they thicken it up. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1557.0s)]
*  They get in there with a mesh and thicken it up. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1559.0s)]
*  Nice sauce. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1562.0s)]
*  When I was heavier even, I went to, I got a consultation, free consultation at a plastic surgeon. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1564.0s)]
*  I was like, I bet if I, I'm fine with my hard dick, but I hate my soft hang sometimes. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1570.0s)]
*  And I was like, I bet if I got my gun sucked out, liposuctioned, it'll make it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1578.0s)]
*  You dig more impressive. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1585.0s)]
*  It'll make it look bigger, soft, particularly. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1586.0s)]
*  And I'm like, so I went to the consultation. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1589.0s)]
*  It was a male doctor, so you're like, okay. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1591.0s)]
*  And he gets you, I mean, I knew he was going to have to look ultimately at one point, but this guy takes me to me. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1594.0s)]
*  He goes, he goes, all right, drop your pants. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1600.0s)]

*  Put a rubber band around your balls. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1611.0s)]
*  So I, so I, he fucking comes in and he's like, drop your pants. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1612.0s)]

*  Are you a cop? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1816.0s)]
*  No. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1818.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course you could say no. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1819.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1820.0s)]
*  Because the good guy who was the cop always had to be honest. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1821.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1823.0s)]
*  He was never lying. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1824.0s)]
*  This guy, he was telling me about, he had to do cocaine with these people. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1825.0s)]
*  They had to beat people up. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1829.0s)]
*  And he's like, if shit went down, man, I had to be a part of it. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1831.0s)]
*  The prostitutes things they would do on cops were always, they'd get in the car and they'd [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1834.0s)]
*  be like, are you a cop? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1837.0s)]
*  And he'd go, come on, do I look like a cop? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1838.0s)]
*  Bro, this guy got busted wearing a wire and got away with it. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1840.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1844.0s)]
*  They didn't find the wire. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1845.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1846.0s)]
*  They came that close. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1847.0s)]
*  He said they were inches away. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1848.0s)]
*  They were rubbing his clothes, like checking all his clothes. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1849.0s)]
*  He said they were inches away, but he was like arguing with them. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1852.0s)]
*  I can't fucking believe you guys. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1855.0s)]
*  Like that kind of shit. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1856.0s)]
*  After I mysteriously showed up three weeks ago and now I'm working my way through the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1858.0s)]
*  ranks. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1863.0s)]
*  Now you're going to start patting me down. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1864.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1865.0s)]
*  And I'm helping you run guns and drugs to Mexico. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1866.0s)]
*  Guys, I bought donuts yesterday morning. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1868.0s)]
*  I'm that guy. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1870.0s)]
*  I'm that guy. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1871.0s)]
*  I am your brother. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1872.0s)]
*  I'm the dude. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1874.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, they all go to jail eventually. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1875.0s)]
*  Also, when they do undercover, it still seems like when they would go home at night still, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1878.0s)]
*  come out of their biker clothes. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1884.0s)]
*  How was it, hon? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1886.0s)]
*  These guys are animals. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1887.0s)]
*  I hope one of them didn't happen to follow me home. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1888.0s)]
*  Well, he was not doing things that were anywhere near his home. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1891.0s)]
*  He would go away for long stretches at a time and go back and forth. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1895.0s)]
*  He had all these reasons for doing so. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1899.0s)]
*  Different businesses that he did that he was involved with. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1901.0s)]
*  Did he ever find himself, you kind of hang with somebody that much time and they think [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1903.0s)]
*  you're their friend. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1908.0s)]
*  Do they ever get sympathy for them? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1909.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1911.0s)]
*  That's one of the more fascinating parts about it. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1912.0s)]
*  This guy that he had to put in jail, that guy was like my friend. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1914.0s)]
*  He's like, we finished each other sentences. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1918.0s)]
*  We were just like each other. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1920.0s)]
*  Other than the fact that he was a criminal and I was an FBI agent. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1922.0s)]
*  And I was like, do you think that you could have gone down that road if you had the wrong [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1925.0s)]
*  lives? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1928.0s)]
*  Like, absolutely, absolutely, man. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1929.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1930.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1931.0s)]
*  All of us could have. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1932.0s)]
*  I go, that's what I think too. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1933.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1934.0s)]
*  That's what happened to Michael Rapoport in Higher Learning. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1935.0s)]
*  He got in with the wrong crowd. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1937.0s)]
*  He was a regular guy with good intentions. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1940.0s)]
*  Next thing you know, he's shooting women. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1942.0s)]
*  Super normal in a 90 minute arc of a film. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1944.0s)]
*  It was so much so fast. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1947.0s)]
*  How does he cheat? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1949.0s)]
*  Unless he's the star of the film where they follow him every step of the way. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1951.0s)]
*  It was a Clockwork Orange for black people. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1955.0s)]
*  They put like, for 90 minutes you just bled. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1957.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1960.0s)]
*  Michael Rapoport is this kid is hilarious. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1961.0s)]
*  You got to see when the cops, it's when the cops have him at the end and they're like, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1964.0s)]
*  son, everything's going to be fine. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1968.0s)]
*  You're white. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1970.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1971.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1972.0s)]
*  Rapoport does a really good job of complaining about things. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1974.0s)]
*  Like he's always got something that he's fucking screaming and yelling about. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1977.0s)]
*  It's pretty hyped about Israel, it seems. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1981.0s)]
*  It seems like it, yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1983.0s)]
*  I've only seen hype about two things, Israel and Ari. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1984.0s)]
*  That's the only two things that have ever hyped him, Michael Rapoport. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1991.0s)]
*  And also I think the rising of the black race also I think pissed him off in that scene. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=1995.0s)]
*  But to his credit, that was the 90s. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2000.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2002.0s)]
*  Nobody knew better back then. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2003.0s)]
*  Well, that's so funny for him also. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2004.0s)]
*  If you remember his first big role, great movie called Zebra Head. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2006.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2010.0s)]
*  And he was like, because that was more of his thing. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2012.0s)]
*  He's more of like a bigger kid. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2015.0s)]
*  He was in Do the Right Thing too, right? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2017.0s)]
*  Was he in Do the Right Thing? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2018.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2019.0s)]
*  I don't know if he was in that. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2020.0s)]
*  True romance for sure. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2021.0s)]
*  That was great. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2022.0s)]

*  May have been. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2111.0s)]
*  Was he in it, Jamie? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2112.0s)]
*  I didn't watch a lot of Spike Lee. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2114.0s)]
*  Oh, he had some bangers in the early days. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2115.0s)]
*  Mobyta Blues made me feel lazy. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2117.0s)]
*  Because I remember Denzel Washington would practice every day. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2119.0s)]
*  You know, like he was an artist. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2123.0s)]
*  He would practice every day. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2124.0s)]
*  And his girl was trying to fuck. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2125.0s)]
*  And he was like, no, no, no, I have to practice. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2127.0s)]
*  And I was like, wow, I wish I was like him. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2129.0s)]
*  I wish I would have practiced more than pussy. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2132.0s)]
*  I would think about that like as a comic. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2134.0s)]
*  Like even when I was a professional comic in the early days, I didn't spend my whole day writing. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2135.0s)]
*  I was fucking off playing pool and hanging out with my friends. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2139.0s)]
*  You might be thinking of True Romance. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2142.0s)]
*  He was in that. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2144.0s)]

*  That is who I'm thinking of. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2165.0s)]
*  It's hard to see in that picture. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2166.0s)]
*  That's crazy because he's younger. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2167.0s)]
*  I mean, Michael's a lot younger. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2168.0s)]
*  But Zebrahead, yeah, he was like his. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2171.0s)]
*  His whole thing is like a hip hop guy. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2173.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2175.0s)]
*  So it's so funny that he plays this like a major role as like a white fucking white supremacist. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2176.0s)]
*  You got to take what you can get. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2183.0s)]
*  You know, it's acting, bro. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2185.0s)]
*  It is acting. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2187.0s)]
*  Do you think Robert De Niro really was a psycho and taxi driver? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2188.0s)]
*  No. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2190.0s)]
*  No? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2191.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2192.0s)]
*  Go watch that movie again. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2193.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2194.0s)]
*  You know, it's funny. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2196.0s)]
*  The building I lived in in New York on 57th Street is the old taxi depot that they shot [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2197.0s)]
*  taxi driver in. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2205.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2206.2s)]
*  And they keep downstairs like where the gym and stuff is, they have the sign still. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2207.2s)]
*  They keep the sign, the original signs for the parking lot. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2211.8s)]
*  That was a good movie. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2215.2s)]
*  That was a fucking great movie. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2216.2s)]
*  And if Robert De Niro just never gave a political speech, I would think about him that way. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2218.0s)]
*  You can't make a movie like that with a budget anymore. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2222.92s)]
*  Every movie with balls, it has to be an indie flick. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2226.6800000000003s)]
*  100%. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2228.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2229.92s)]
*  Or you have to be some beyond reproach director that they just let do whatever they wanted. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2230.92s)]
*  Like Tarantino. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2235.2000000000003s)]
*  There's no way Once Upon a Time in Hollywood went through some sort of executive focus [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2236.2000000000003s)]
*  group. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2241.84s)]
*  There's no fucking way. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2242.84s)]
*  He's killing women, smashing their head on a mantle. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2243.84s)]
*  Spoiler alert. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2247.48s)]
*  I mean, dogs are eating dicks. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2248.48s)]
*  What a brilliant ending though. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2251.04s)]
*  That movie is great. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2253.56s)]
*  So good. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2254.56s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2255.56s)]
*  I love that movie. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2256.56s)]
*  I don't know if I've seen that final scene where they flip history. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2257.56s)]
*  I've never had an audience in a movie theater like Communally Laugh like that since the [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2262.3199999999997s)]
*  Jackass movies. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2265.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2266.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2267.8799999999997s)]
*  Jackass 2. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2268.8799999999997s)]
*  It was a cheering moment too. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2269.8799999999997s)]
*  That was a fucking great movie. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2270.96s)]
*  He's got all bangers. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2272.3199999999997s)]
*  He's the only guy that I could say as a, well, there's a few others you probably could put [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2273.8799999999997s)]
*  in that argument that have zero movies where I'm like, oh. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2277.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, that have no, like everything's good. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2281.88s)]
*  Tarantino? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2283.84s)]
*  There's not one that I can think of that wasn't fucking awesome. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2284.84s)]
*  I love David Lynch movies made some crap. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2287.36s)]
*  I liked a movie that you have to try to figure out, but when you can't figure it out and [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2291.36s)]
*  other people can't figure it out, you're like, this is just a hunk of shit there. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2294.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2298.0s)]
*  Like you can't be so artistic that nothing makes sense. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2299.0s)]
*  James Cameron's done some fucking bangers. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2301.48s)]
*  Do you watch, like I've gone through on the road and watched like the 25 most disturbing [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2303.88s)]
*  movies of all time? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2308.28s)]
*  No, I don't like being disturbed that much, do you? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2310.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2313.04s)]
*  I mean, I just kind of see how far people will go in a movie. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2314.6s)]
*  There's some, I mean, Serbian films, the most notorious. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2317.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's some fucking psycho movies. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2319.88s)]
*  Like who's that one, that evil clown that kills everybody and doesn't talk? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2322.4s)]
*  The Terrifier? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2326.72s)]
*  Oh, Terrifier, yeah, yeah. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2327.72s)]
*  Bro, these movies are fucked up. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2328.72s)]
*  Yeah, but they can't be on purpose. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2331.44s)]
*  Like they're so over the top. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2333.48s)]
*  There was a whole category of films. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2334.88s)]
*  I was really in horror movies when I was young and there was a whole category of films that [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2337.2s)]
*  were just gore films. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2341.44s)]
*  It was, they were called gore. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2343.16s)]
*  It was like a gore, it was those guys would like chop women up with an axe and pull their [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2345.08s)]
*  guts out and rub them all with their feet. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2348.8399999999997s)]
*  Like fuck the movie. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2350.72s)]
*  They also had excessive nudity in them. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2351.72s)]
*  Those were the horror boxes at the video store that were bigger than everything else. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2354.92s)]
*  Like those like I Spit on Your Grave movies like that. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2361.2799999999997s)]
*  The box was way bigger so you really had to walk up like a piece of shit. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2363.16s)]
*  I'm gonna watch this Rape Revenge movie with my other teenage friends, thank you. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2368.0s)]
*  Nothing like a good slasher Rape Revenge movie. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2371.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2375.3199999999997s)]
*  Revenge movies are the fucking best. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2376.3199999999997s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2378.12s)]
*  We're so dumb. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2379.12s)]
*  We like to just sit there and watch this guy kick everybody's ass. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2380.12s)]
*  Yeah, fuck him up. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2382.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's Robocop. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2383.72s)]
*  Love it. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2384.72s)]
*  It's the fantasy. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2385.72s)]
*  Did you ever see Sisou? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2386.72s)]
*  No. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it's my favorite. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2389.2799999999997s)]
*  It's next to John Wick. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2390.28s)]
*  It's probably right up there with John Wick as my favorite revenge movie of all time. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2391.96s)]
*  It's about a guy and the whole movie has no English in it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2395.76s)]
*  It's in World War II. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2398.52s)]
*  Is it Finland? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2400.44s)]
*  I think so. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2401.44s)]
*  And this dude is a soldier who retired from the war and became a gold miner and made a [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2402.8s)]
*  little score and was trying to get to the town with his score and he runs into the Nazis. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2410.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's so fun. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2416.6400000000003s)]
*  It's so fun because you could tell this guy does not want to do this, but he's got to [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2420.12s)]
*  kill everybody and they all get cocky with him. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2427.76s)]
*  What do you think the mindset is? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2431.8s)]
*  He got gold! [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2434.2s)]
*  Nice. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2436.2s)]
*  So it turns out this guy was like famous in the war for being impossible to kill. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2441.2s)]
*  He has scars all over his body. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2445.96s)]
*  He's like the absolute worst guy and they found him and he kills everybody. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2448.48s)]
*  Spoiler alert. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2454.4s)]
*  And it's fucking great. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2455.4s)]
*  It's just fun. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2457.36s)]
*  What do you think the mindset is behind Liam Neeson, who I mean there's a movie comes out [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2458.36s)]
*  almost bi-monthly of him getting revenge for something. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2464.6s)]
*  Hey, it's a living. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2468.48s)]
*  I get it. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2470.52s)]
*  Bruce Willis started doing that towards the end. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2471.52s)]
*  Bruce Willis at the end started doing that. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2473.76s)]
*  Did he? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2475.48s)]
*  Were there just movies that were just like two words or something? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2476.48s)]
*  Well I think he was suffering from that illness for quite a while. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2479.36s)]
*  You know what it is? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2483.64s)]
*  It's called aphasia. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2484.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2485.64s)]
*  It's dementia, right? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2486.64s)]
*  It's not good. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2487.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's bad. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2488.64s)]
*  It's real bad. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2489.64s)]
*  I don't know what causes it, whether it's genetic or what have you, but people, they [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2490.64s)]
*  slip away. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2494.48s)]
*  And he might have, you know, towards the end. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2495.64s)]
*  He just goes, this guy. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2499.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's got a lot of them. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2500.64s)]
*  They're all him with the gun. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2503.0s)]
*  It's all him with the gun. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2504.0s)]

*  Keanu Reeves is going to be Dracula now? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2559.28s)]
*  That's crazy because he was in the Dracula movie back in the day. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2561.4s)]
*  And he was Dracula's girlfriend's boyfriend. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2564.2s)]

*  Have you got him on? Yeah, he was a cool guy to talk to. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2574.6s)]
*  He was I toured with him. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2577.08s)]
*  I've met him a handful of times. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2579.2799999999997s)]
*  He's good friends with Tom Papa. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  We've been introduced in that regard. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2582.2799999999997s)]
*  And whenever I see him, it's the blank of like, nope. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2583.72s)]
*  I went on stage right before him the entire tour and he has no recollection. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2588.16s)]
*  One time, this is a great story. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2595.08s)]
*  I was we had tickets to go or passes to go see Rob Zombie's. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2598.2s)]
*  I think it was the Halloween, the original Halloween remake he did. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2603.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And comedian Julian McCullough had these passes, four of us. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2606.16s)]
*  It was going to be me, Nate Bargatze. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2611.12s)]
*  And I'm trying to remember Dave Smith. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2615.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was Dave Smith and Julian McCullough. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2617.72s)]
*  And I had auditioned for a TV show the morning of that. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2620.32s)]
*  And it was the first audition I ever did that it went well, but really well. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2625.0800000000004s)]
*  And I got it. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2629.6400000000003s)]
*  I got the part of the show was over two years called Z Rock. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2630.84s)]
*  But they go, this is how much acting is not my passion or something like that. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2634.44s)]
*  They go, we need you to come back in at like four for a table read. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2638.48s)]
*  We're going to do. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2643.0400000000004s)]
*  And all I thought was I was like, shit, that Rob Zombie movie starts like six o'clock. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2644.1200000000003s)]
*  How long are we going to be here for? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2648.7599999999998s)]
*  Like, she went back an hour or so when you get back here. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2650.2s)]
*  And it was going it was running late when we got back there. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2654.48s)]
*  So I told Nate Bargatze to go, I'm like, hey, go down there and get in line, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2656.6s)]
*  you know, to make sure we get into this thing. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2662.64s)]
*  I don't know if they're overselling it or not. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2664.7999999999997s)]
*  And he goes, all right. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2666.64s)]
*  So I get out of this thing and I'm rushing down. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2667.3199999999997s)]
*  We're walking to this movie theater and I call Nate. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2669.48s)]
*  This is so defeating. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2673.12s)]
*  I go, hey, you're down. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2674.24s)]
*  He goes, I don't know if I'm at the right theater. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2675.56s)]
*  And I went, what do you mean? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2678.44s)]
*  He goes, I mean, there's a big line for something. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2679.5200000000004s)]
*  And I was like, go get in that line, Nate. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2682.76s)]
*  And he was like, oh, that's it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2686.28s)]
*  So we get there. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2687.6000000000004s)]
*  We're so far back in line, there's no way we're getting this movie. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2689.44s)]
*  And I'm like, shit, Julian's very handsome. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2692.6800000000003s)]
*  So we send him up to kind of schmooze the girl up front. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2695.0s)]
*  No dice. And then I see Rob Zombie walk into the diner next door. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2697.4s)]
*  And I go, this might be our chance. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2703.1200000000003s)]
*  I we just are loosely connected. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2705.64s)]
*  And, you know, maybe I can get him to remember. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2708.0s)]
*  And we go in there. It's my best interaction with him ever. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2711.12s)]
*  I go up, I go, hey, Rob, I go, Jay Okerson, I go, we met through Tom Papa before. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2713.3199999999997s)]
*  And Bob, he's like, oh, yeah. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2718.6s)]
*  And he shoots the shit with us for like five minutes. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2720.04s)]
*  And then I go, well, anyway, man, I'm really excited for the movie. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2722.8399999999997s)]
*  I hope we get in. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2725.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, we're like super far back in line. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2726.64s)]
*  He goes, you'll be fine. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2728.6s)]
*  Just so. And then we and we did not get in. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2730.48s)]
*  We rode a hot subway home together staring at Nate. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2733.68s)]
*  Oh, no, you'll be fine. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2735.7599999999998s)]
*  He goes, yeah, you'll be fine. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2737.92s)]
*  You'll be fine as I'm not going to help you. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2739.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it really wasn't a flight out. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2741.56s)]
*  He goes, this has been great, but leave me alone now. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2743.44s)]
*  The thing about it, though, is like, does he save tickets? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2746.04s)]
*  Like, does he have a block of tickets saved? For sure. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2749.44s)]
*  For sure. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2753.96s)]
*  Not for the guy at the diner, though. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2756.92s)]
*  There's some people you just don't resonate with in the world, I think. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2758.4s)]
*  At the time, I don't know. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2761.84s)]
*  Dave Chappelle is another one. Dave Chappelle. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2762.7599999999998s)]
*  I've met over the last 25 years a dozen times. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2764.96s)]
*  I did some punch ups on season one of Chappelle's show. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2768.92s)]
*  He bumped me and Kurt Metzger off a weekend in the thing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2773.08s)]
*  And we were there and we hung out with him there. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2776.64s)]
*  And every time I see him still, it's just completely unfamiliar. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2778.8s)]
*  Chris Rock. Same thing. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2782.64s)]
*  I do not make an impression with these people. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2784.0s)]
*  That's so weird. I also shut down around celebrity. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2785.8s)]
*  Oh, maybe that's it. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2788.56s)]
*  So I'm not I can't inject my personality out of the gates [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2789.84s)]
*  in a situation where I'm like intimidated by like someone. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2795.92s)]
*  I'm like, I'm like where I go not intimidated, but I go, man, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2798.28s)]
*  I really want them to like me. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2800.76s)]
*  Isn't that weird? Because you know, so many famous people. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2802.6400000000003s)]
*  But but you know what I mean by wanting to like not like me, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2805.2000000000003s)]
*  but I go, if I try to be funny and I whiff. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2808.28s)]
*  Right. This sucks. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2811.7200000000003s)]
*  You just feel nervous. Right. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2813.2400000000002s)]
*  So I'm like, I could just lay low and not take the risk of being not funny by accident. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2815.0400000000004s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2820.1200000000003s)]
*  It's hard. There's no one who intimidates you anymore. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2823.32s)]
*  I mean, the people you have in here and just strike a conversation with is unbelievable. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2825.0s)]
*  No, people don't intimidate me anymore. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2828.4s)]
*  They inspire me. Some people are fascinating. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2830.0800000000004s)]
*  They inspire me every time I have a big guest coming in that I don't know on [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2833.0400000000004s)]
*  me and Bobby Kelly on the radio show. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2837.8s)]
*  And someone's coming in. I get like when they're like, all right, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2839.76s)]
*  we're going to go get them now. I'm always like, wait. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2841.92s)]
*  All right. OK, go get them. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2843.84s)]
*  Because I'm like, shit, what do we even start with? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2845.36s)]
*  I used to be like that on Opie and Anthony. Yeah. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2848.16s)]
*  Yeah. When I go on Opie and Anthony and like they'd have famous guests there. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2850.48s)]
*  I'd be like, holy shit. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2853.32s)]
*  You know, that's this guy. Holy shit. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2854.56s)]
*  That's that guy. Yeah. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2856.92s)]
*  It's weird. The first time I went there, I got bumped back to the couch for Ace [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2858.08s)]
*  Freely. It's a party who's like, this sucks. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2861.52s)]
*  But wow, it's fucking free. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2864.12s)]
*  I met Ace Freely when I was a little kid. Really? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2865.44s)]
*  Yeah. My uncle was an artist and he was working for [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2867.88s)]
*  this advertising agency in New York City, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2872.6s)]
*  where they made album covers. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2876.7999999999997s)]
*  So they made album covers for Kiss. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2878.44s)]
*  So my uncle was one of the artists that made the album covers [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2880.12s)]
*  for a lot of the Kiss albums. No shit. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2883.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So I was in his office hanging out with him during the day. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2885.44s)]
*  I was probably eight or something like that. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2888.56s)]
*  I was fucking young, man. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2892.04s)]
*  And maybe I was a little older than that. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2893.7999999999997s)]
*  I can't remember. It's hard to remember. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2895.72s)]
*  But I was a little kid. It was pre high school. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2897.4s)]
*  And this guy walks in with like, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2899.44s)]
*  you know, long hair, looks weird, just like a weird dude. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2902.8399999999997s)]
*  And he made some like weird noise like, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2905.8799999999997s)]
*  it was real strange. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2909.04s)]
*  And then everybody goes, hey, Ace, hey, Ace. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2910.3999999999996s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2913.68s)]
*  Like, that's that's Ace Freely with no makeup on. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2915.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, this is crazy. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2918.6s)]
*  He was old and he signed a napkin for me. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2920.04s)]
*  Do you have it? Yeah. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2923.52s)]
*  Well, no, I don't think I have it anymore. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2924.52s)]
*  My mom might have it. I'll ask her. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2926.12s)]
*  I doubt it. It got lost somewhere. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2927.8399999999997s)]
*  But it was the craziest thing. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2930.4399999999996s)]
*  I was like, wow, that's the famous guy with no makeup, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2932.4399999999996s)]
*  because everywhere they went, they were people were paparazzi [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2934.88s)]
*  were always trying to catch them. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2937.4s)]
*  You know, like Gene Simmons would wear like a bandit's mask. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2938.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And they were always trying to catch them [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2941.12s)]
*  without their makeup on. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2943.0s)]
*  Has a celebrity ever let you down? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2944.04s)]
*  Like when you met them? Not really. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2946.08s)]
*  No, honestly, no. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2948.56s)]
*  No, there's no like no, no. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2950.56s)]
*  I've always worried about that. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2952.7200000000003s)]
*  Marilyn Manson was always somebody I wanted to meet. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2953.92s)]
*  And then when he went through all this shit, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2956.08s)]
*  did not want to meet. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2957.4s)]
*  So I was like, stay away. But then I want to like, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2958.56s)]
*  I very much would like to met him. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2960.76s)]
*  I think he's such an interesting character. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2961.92s)]
*  But like, I'm like, you can. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2963.56s)]
*  I'm such a fan since I was a kid that I'm like, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2965.4s)]
*  this could only let me down somehow. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2967.28s)]
*  I met him. He's very interesting. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2968.8s)]
*  He's an artist. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2970.84s)]
*  He's a, you know, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2972.56s)]
*  if you think of some of the songs, he's really beautiful people. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2975.24s)]
*  You don't make that unless you're out of your fucking mind. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2978.24s)]
*  Like, that's part of the that's part of the package. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2980.84s)]
*  No, you want brilliant, fucking wild music. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2983.92s)]
*  You got to get a dude who's out of his fucking mind. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2986.56s)]
*  Do you have any theories on why people can't like classic, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2988.88s)]
*  amazing bands can't make a classic again? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2992.96s)]
*  Comedians can still write their best joke and it will be accepted. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=2995.64s)]
*  Everyone's looking for that. What's the new thing? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3000.4s)]
*  But like if Guns N' Roses got everybody back together again [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3002.68s)]
*  and sat in a room for three months, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3006.12s)]
*  they can't make Welcome to the Jungle again. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3007.7200000000003s)]
*  They're not the same guys. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3009.56s)]
*  You know, that's part of the problem. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3011.08s)]
*  And then also part of the problem is I want to see Guns N' Roses in Athens. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3012.44s)]
*  I saw him in Greece. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3015.68s)]
*  It was just a total coincidence. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3017.2s)]
*  I was there with my family and I ran an Axl Rose at a restaurant. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3019.28s)]
*  That's more recent. Real recent. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3023.08s)]
*  OK. Last summer. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3024.6s)]
*  There's yeah, like last summer, the summer before last, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3025.88s)]
*  summer before last, I guess. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3028.2400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, it's one of those weird moments like, God, I hope he knows who I am. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3029.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3033.56s)]
*  I'm going to go say hi. I'm going to be a dick. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3034.32s)]
*  And this is after my friend tried to say hi to him and he got shooed away. Oh. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3036.4s)]
*  So I went over to his table and he was like, oh, hey, man, what's up? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3040.84s)]
*  I was really nice to meet you. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3045.4s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of this thing because we're doing a concert here tomorrow night. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3046.68s)]
*  You want to see him? Like, fuck, yeah. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3048.96s)]
*  And so my whole family went to see Guns N' Roses. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3050.56s)]
*  We're backstage. Watch. It was amazing. Three hour performance. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3052.76s)]
*  These guys are in their 60s. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3055.5200000000004s)]
*  They're fucking rocking hard. I saw him on the new tour. Three hours. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3056.92s)]
*  But the thing is, they have so many hits. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3059.92s)]
*  If if you want them to do all the songs you love, it's going to take a long time. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3062.4s)]
*  And if they're going to add new songs. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3067.32s)]
*  Isn't it crazy, too, that it's essentially four albums? Crazy. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3069.32s)]
*  All of that from four albums. Bangers. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3073.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, they did great. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3075.6800000000003s)]
*  I was pretty impressed with that. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3077.36s)]
*  From the end, the age, dude, welcome to the jungle to this day. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3079.8s)]
*  I'll hear that song. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3083.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, God damn, that was fucking good. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3084.2000000000003s)]
*  I took my parents to see it in Madison Square Garden. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3086.2400000000002s)]
*  And it was such a weird I got so straight. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3089.88s)]
*  The things I get emotional about are ridiculous. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3092.44s)]
*  I got like teary eyed emotional when it starts. Welcome to the jungle. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3094.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, they start playing the riff. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3097.92s)]
*  And I got immediately teary eyed because I was like, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3099.5600000000004s)]
*  it just took me back immediately to a time. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3102.2400000000002s)]
*  It was like a time travel. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3104.2400000000002s)]
*  And I was like, holy shit, I'm like 11, 12 years old. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3105.8s)]
*  Got this album. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3108.2799999999997s)]
*  And my mom was like, what is that shit? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3109.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, and now my mom's like here with me watching them as a classic rock band. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3111.12s)]
*  What year did Welcome to the Jungle come out? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3115.48s)]
*  87, I want to say 86. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3117.72s)]
*  I remember being right out of high school at the gym, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3121.48s)]
*  lifting weights the first time I heard it. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3125.7999999999997s)]
*  They were, you know, at the gym, everybody would just play what's on the radio. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3128.56s)]
*  You know, WC, OZ. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3131.96s)]
*  And you we were listening to the I think it was WBC and the Rock of Boston [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3134.64s)]
*  Appetite for Destruction 87. Yep. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3139.56s)]
*  So that was two years out of high school. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3142.08s)]
*  And I was like, wow, listen to this. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3144.16s)]
*  You know, the first time I heard it and kind of backwards [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3147.4s)]
*  tracked it from there, I think that came out pretty sure it came out first. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3151.04s)]
*  Was the movie Deadpool. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3155.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The Deadpool Clint Eastwood. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3156.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3158.88s)]
*  And the scene was Jim, pre famous Jim Carrey [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3159.7599999999998s)]
*  plays a rock star junkie and they're shooting his music video [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3163.72s)]
*  and the song they're using is Welcome to the Jungle. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3167.7999999999997s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3170.12s)]
*  You can see it's a pretty popular scene. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3171.3199999999997s)]
*  If you look it up, Deadpool, the Deadpool. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3173.0s)]
*  When did Jim Carrey, when did Motley Crue come out with Kickstart My Heart? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3176.6s)]
*  That's probably 86. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3182.3199999999997s)]
*  That's that was my favorite workout song of all time. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3183.96s)]
*  Look at that Jim Carrey. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3188.96s)]
*  That's Jim Carrey. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3190.68s)]
*  Isn't it funny, even though he's not being funny at all, he still [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3191.6s)]
*  it's like his movements are so Jim Carrey. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3194.4s)]
*  Like, right. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  But like, again, you don't get to be Jim Carrey unless you're out of your [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3202.2799999999997s)]
*  fucking mind. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3205.24s)]

*  They said Ron Jeremy was the person who had it. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3568.2000000000003s)]
*  And he's another guy's big and fat. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3570.4s)]
*  Yeah, he was the he came to the cellar one time with a Dennis Hoff guy, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3572.5600000000004s)]
*  which, yeah, that was a guy of the people, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3577.5600000000004s)]
*  like, quote unquote, celebrities who would come in that I can never pay [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3580.4s)]
*  like homage to and have like the thing was they didn't want to meet [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3582.84s)]
*  was like a Dennis Hoff. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3585.76s)]
*  The wife of the bunny house. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3587.36s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why it was so celebrated. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3588.96s)]
*  I know it's like it's legal, but like, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3590.5600000000004s)]
*  you still don't see his personality is kind of skeevy as shit. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3592.32s)]
*  Well, there was a weird time where for whatever reason [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3595.1200000000003s)]
*  they were kind of celebrating pimps and prostitutes. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3599.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, do you remember Pimp's Up, Hose Down? Sure. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3604.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that was like a famous documentary. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3606.44s)]
*  Mr. White Folks. Yeah. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3608.88s)]
*  He was the best. Yeah, I watched all those. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3610.92s)]
*  But they were like celebrated, like people like. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3613.8s)]
*  And then there was American Pimp. Remember that film? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3616.2000000000003s)]
*  No, it was. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3619.72s)]
*  Well, that was like the small window of like [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3620.96s)]
*  pro sexuality and go be whores girls. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3625.2s)]
*  And then it immediately became me, too. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3627.88s)]
*  That happened immediately, though, because it was the exploiters of those women. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3630.88s)]
*  It wasn't like it's OK to be a prostitute. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3635.16s)]
*  It was it's cool to be the man who exploits all these women [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3637.72s)]
*  and gets them to go be prostitutes for them. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3641.3199999999997s)]
*  I think it took 20 some years for people to realize that Joe Francis [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3643.56s)]
*  was a terrible guy. You know, I mean, he was celebrated as as hell. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3646.12s)]
*  I just heard a Howard Stern clip the other day where he had Joe Francis on. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3648.88s)]
*  I'm sure if you ask about Joe Francis now, he'd be like, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3652.44s)]
*  what a terrible piece of shit. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3654.6s)]
*  Yeah. But when Girls Gone Wild was a thing, everyone was just like, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3656.56s)]
*  who cares how it gets done? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3659.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy, right? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3661.6s)]
*  Like Girls Gone Wild, that's how the when the Internet wasn't around, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3662.6800000000003s)]
*  you could buy tapes of drunk girls at the bar flashing their boobs. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3666.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Pay for it. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3669.6400000000003s)]
*  You'd pay for it. Yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3671.28s)]
*  And it had like a production value. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3672.92s)]
*  Oh, no, you pay you pay for it. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3674.76s)]
*  And then you were part of a subscription service that is that what it was? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3676.88s)]
*  Yeah. And then every month it would be like Girls Gone Wild, Girls on Campus 2 [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3680.08s)]
*  and Girls Covered in Bubbles. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3684.4s)]
*  Was it one of those things where they trick you into subscribing? Yeah. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3686.32s)]
*  It's Columbia House like Columbia House for titties. Yeah. Crazy. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3689.92s)]
*  Oh, I've ruined Columbia House and me have ruined the credit of my [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3694.44s)]
*  all my pets in my life. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3699.2000000000003s)]
*  Did they get your credit? Columbia House got in your credit. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3700.84s)]
*  No, no, I'm saying you just put you send the penny and you put right. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3703.44s)]
*  You put your cat's name down and then they just send you 10 CDs. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3706.12s)]
*  But it doesn't ever really. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3709.6s)]
*  What was the checks and balances on that? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3710.6s)]
*  I always thought that that was a fluff up scheme for the record business [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3712.72s)]
*  where they could say they sold more records than they did. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3716.3599999999997s)]
*  That's possible. That's actually not a bad move. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3718.64s)]
*  Kind of a good move if you want to get a gold record or a platinum record. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3720.64s)]
*  Sell as many as you can. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3724.04s)]
*  You'd be 10. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3725.08s)]
*  When it went up to a dollar, send a dollar is where it stopped. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3725.68s)]
*  You know, guys, but a dollar willing to give you a penny. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3729.24s)]
*  Yeah, to me, a dollar really was like, no, I just usually tape a penny [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3731.92s)]
*  to a postcard. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3735.28s)]
*  What a concept to take penny here, it said is the dumbest concept ever. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3736.92s)]
*  You give them one penny. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3740.88s)]
*  And if you give them one penny, they give you a bunch of CDs [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3742.88s)]
*  and you're supposed to give them money. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3745.84s)]
*  You know, like, well, you get to pick them. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3747.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You pick your first 10. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3749.0800000000004s)]
*  DC, DC. It was my taking. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3750.7200000000003s)]
*  It was my before I had [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3752.96s)]
*  porn magazines readily available to go into a bathroom [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3755.48s)]
*  or anywhere where there was a bathroom where I felt I could quietly [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3758.2400000000002s)]
*  look at porn magazines. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3761.28s)]
*  It was the TV guide. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3762.72s)]
*  Take the TV guide to the bathroom, do the crossword puzzle [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3764.4399999999996s)]
*  and then pick my 10 CDs for a penny because it was always an insert [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3766.68s)]
*  on the TV guide. That's right. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3769.9199999999996s)]
*  And it was the postcard. Yep. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3771.24s)]
*  Tape penny here. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3772.68s)]
*  And you send it in and all sudden you get cassette tapes are in the mail. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3773.68s)]
*  Oh, boy. Yeah. Oh, boy. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3777.3999999999996s)]
*  It was so great. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3779.52s)]
*  But isn't it a smart move on their part because it probably [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3780.52s)]
*  introduced people to a lot of music, because if you think about it, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3783.24s)]
*  you're only listening to the radio. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3787.0s)]
*  The radio is only playing what they play and they can only play so many songs. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3788.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. And if it's a hit, they're going to play that hit over and over again. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3791.52s)]
*  You can hear this and there's Rolling Stones. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3794.4799999999996s)]
*  There's Led Zeppelin. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3796.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, you don't have a lot of time for other music. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3798.2s)]
*  No. So this is a good way, even if you're giving it away to people, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3800.8799999999997s)]
*  which mostly are like what percentage let's find this out. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3803.9199999999996s)]
*  What percentage of people actually paid for their Columbia record and tapes? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3808.0s)]
*  I think adults would definitely end up paying for it, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3812.6s)]
*  because I think the deal was you're giving them your address. Right. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3815.3199999999997s)]
*  So whatever the fake name you put down, they're billing. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3817.6s)]
*  I don't remember them chasing me at all. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3819.6s)]
*  I didn't feel it, but they have. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3821.56s)]
*  But what they would do, though, is send you more. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3823.2s)]
*  They would send you a guy, get like a CD every month that I wasn't picking. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3826.32s)]
*  Ninety reaches the peak in 94. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3829.96s)]
*  It accounted for 15.1 percent of all CD sales. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3832.0s)]
*  Yeah. Had 10 million members. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3835.44s)]
*  You became a member of a club. That was kind of what was happening. Right. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3837.64s)]
*  What percentage of people paid them? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3841.04s)]
*  Well, that's I mean, it doesn't say it on here. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3843.16s)]
*  But if you think about just that, that's almost like more radio. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3846.04s)]
*  Right. You're putting the song on the radio for free. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3849.68s)]
*  You're sending out these cassettes, even if people don't pay. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3852.48s)]
*  That music's getting out there. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3854.96s)]
*  They're going to maybe buy another Rolling Stones record [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3856.56s)]
*  or tickets to see the Rolling Stones. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3859.84s)]
*  Well, you know, people didn't complain about being part of Columbia House. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3862.28s)]
*  I don't feel like but it's like remember when, you know, as like Metallica, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3865.64s)]
*  getting furious about like LimeWire and Napster and those things. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3869.08s)]
*  But it's like it is sort of the same thing. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3873.28s)]
*  Like your sacrifice. But but it wasn't. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3875.32s)]
*  But it came from a time, though, where the money was from the recording. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3877.44s)]
*  Yeah. But it wasn't taking away for the money of the recording [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3880.84s)]
*  because you couldn't, you know, like it wasn't that many people doing it. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3884.36s)]
*  When it became something you could just download onto your computer. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3888.08s)]
*  That got weird. Sure. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3890.88s)]
*  And then record sales dropped off a cliff. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3892.44s)]
*  So they were right in the rough. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3894.92s)]
*  But they were wrong that you can stop it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3896.64s)]
*  Like you can't you couldn't stop it. Right. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3898.52s)]
*  Once like they were trying to like put fingers into a broken dam. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3900.2000000000003s)]
*  There's no way like you got to get the buck out of the way. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3904.16s)]
*  Like you can't once it's on the Internet, when things are on the Internet, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3906.72s)]
*  you can't say it's stealing to download it to your fans. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3909.88s)]
*  You can't do any. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3913.0s)]
*  You just got to realize, oh, the world just changed. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3913.68s)]
*  The people stay that stand off for a while to like was it Maynard [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3915.52s)]
*  did not want to go on Apple Music or Spotify or anything forever. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3919.4s)]
*  I think Garth Brooks didn't either. Right. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3924.12s)]
*  Kid Rock didn't for a long time. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3926.16s)]
*  And then a lot of them would try to go and like, I'm going to do my own Apple music. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3928.64s)]
*  No one gets that right. Yeah. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3933.2799999999997s)]
*  Did that work? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3935.56s)]
*  I don't. You know, it's interesting. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3936.8s)]
*  When I talked to Kevin Hart in Montreal some years back and he was buying up [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3939.0s)]
*  he was buying up things for the L.O.L. Network [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3946.4s)]
*  that he was starting, which was, I guess, an Internet network. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3950.52s)]
*  And they made all this news because when he did the pitch show [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3953.6800000000003s)]
*  where they were pitching ideas for his network, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3957.44s)]
*  he apparently in the room bought like four or five of them. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3960.92s)]
*  And when I saw him that night, I was like, are these five five shows you saw today? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3964.48s)]
*  They're like definite shows. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3968.48s)]
*  And he was like, no, but it gets your press. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3969.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, I mean, he was telling me kind of like the whole thing of it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3972.0s)]
*  He goes, but the idea of he was saying he was doing with that. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3974.04s)]
*  I'm like, are you going to run a network now? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3976.2400000000002s)]
*  And he was like, no, you want to build it until it becomes competitive. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3977.6000000000004s)]
*  And then another company comes along, goes, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3980.88s)]
*  can we give you money just to go away is the idea. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3983.52s)]
*  You know, so it's like the idea is that he wants Netflix to buy. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3986.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, how weird. L.O.L. or something like that. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3989.32s)]
*  So it's just building a business move. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3991.0s)]
*  But I don't know. Absolutely. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3992.32s)]
*  But I think you think like that. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3993.88s)]
*  I have no business acumen whatsoever. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3995.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's a weird business acumen to have. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=3997.36s)]
*  But I'm also but probably effective. I'm, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4000.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, blown away by, you know, I watch you when you talk to Bert [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4004.28s)]
*  sometimes about that, about his employment of so many people. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4007.56s)]
*  Yeah. And everything like which is great. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4010.36s)]
*  He's got a great thing over there. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4013.0800000000004s)]
*  But like production, I feel like the. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4014.6400000000003s)]
*  When you get a lot of money sometimes, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4018.0800000000004s)]
*  which is impressive that you haven't done this, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4020.36s)]
*  it's like you want to do almost like too much like, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4021.88s)]
*  well, I'm a producer of things. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4024.12s)]
*  And now it's like this or other businesses that you want to like [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4025.92s)]
*  start that are outside of comedy. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4028.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, is that what your thing was always? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4030.36s)]
*  Like it was never mine. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4031.96s)]
*  Like to be like a business owner or anything or some kind of like, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4032.92s)]
*  you know, where I was to have products or something. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4036.2400000000002s)]
*  I think what happens is once guys realize the amount of money [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4038.7200000000003s)]
*  that they can make, they want to just make more. Sure. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4043.1600000000003s)]
*  And it just becomes a numbers thing. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4045.6800000000003s)]
*  You just you see it and you're like, oh, my God, I can't believe [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4047.08s)]
*  I'm making this much money. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4049.28s)]
*  But if I did this, then I make even more. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4050.16s)]
*  But I'd rather give a friend [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4052.3999999999996s)]
*  like some capital to like do their special than over. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4054.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean, unless I was taking a job in it, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4059.08s)]
*  I'm going to direct this and see if I can do that. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4060.56s)]
*  You know, but just like the idea of like I'm taking in like [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4062.92s)]
*  I have to take a meeting for a sketch show that wants to be on my network today. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4067.0s)]
*  I'm like, I also you only have so much bandwidth. Sure. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4070.24s)]
*  And this is what I think people fail to think about. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4073.68s)]
*  Like you you you require time to do everything. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4077.36s)]
*  Your time is limited. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4081.6400000000003s)]
*  Like you really have to think if you oh, I could fit it in. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4083.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, I could do this or do that. Sure, you can. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4085.84s)]
*  But then there's no you time at all. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4088.32s)]
*  And then you're running on fumes. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4090.1600000000003s)]
*  And when there's no you time and you're running on fumes, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4092.0s)]
*  you're not the best version of yourself. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4093.92s)]
*  So you got to know like where you're at. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4095.52s)]
*  You got to know where you're at, like in terms of like your your sanity. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4097.24s)]
*  Like if you're working all the time, five different jobs constantly [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4101.4800000000005s)]
*  and you're never home, you sleep till fucking seven in the morning [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4106.2s)]
*  and then you're up gone all day and fucking going, going, going, going, going, going, going. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4110.639999999999s)]
*  You don't have a long time. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4115.48s)]
*  If you don't have a long time, you don't even know how you feel about things. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4117.76s)]
*  We also get used to odd things like my alone time. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4120.84s)]
*  I look at it as like the hotel, like the hotel room. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4123.4s)]
*  Just watching the bullshit that I want to watch on YouTube and doing it like that. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4126.679999999999s)]
*  It is strange when I think I want to be like off [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4130.12s)]
*  and like stationary for a while. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4133.4800000000005s)]
*  Like I feel like the day is like a day here and there where it's like morning till night. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4135.4400000000005s)]
*  I just have nothing I have to do. It's rare. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4139.4400000000005s)]
*  But when it happens that day, I tend to not be in a great mood. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4141.4s)]
*  I don't know why. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4144.64s)]
*  Well, it's because what you do, you love and it's fun. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4145.64s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4148.28s)]
*  Like if you're doing something all day long and it's just like business stuff [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4149.04s)]
*  and it's just for money and it's not something you love, that's a different vibe. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4152.64s)]
*  Right. That's like a hustle vibe. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4156.2s)]
*  I want to get these get these numbers up and get this going. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4158.04s)]
*  And I'm a fucking I'm a worker and I'm going to grind. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4160.8s)]
*  I'm going to show you because look, I got this now and then I got that now. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4163.320000000001s)]
*  See, I'm grinding. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4166.6s)]
*  But as if it's a virtue, I always try to say [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4167.92s)]
*  this is a very important thing that people need to hear. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4170.4400000000005s)]
*  Just because it's hard to do doesn't mean it's good to do. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4174.4800000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are hard to do that you don't necessarily want to do. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4177.8s)]
*  I don't want to climb Mount Everest. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4181.76s)]
*  It's hard to do, but doesn't mean it's good to do. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4183.28s)]
*  It might be good to do for you because you need to prove to yourself [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4185.92s)]
*  that you can do this extremely difficult thing. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4189.32s)]
*  But people are dead. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4191.24s)]
*  There's a bunch of dead bodies up there. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4192.16s)]
*  That's not a good thing to do. Yeah. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4194.16s)]
*  To me, in my opinion, there's a lot of stuff like that in life. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4195.799999999999s)]
*  And just because you can do things, I'll show everybody that I work harder [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4199.04s)]
*  than everybody else. Like maybe you shouldn't. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4202.4s)]
*  Sure. You need balance. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4205.24s)]
*  You need balance in this life. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4208.639999999999s)]
*  And that's hard to get once you start. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4210.599999999999s)]
*  When you start making money, the big fear is, what if it all goes away? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4212.719999999999s)]
*  100 percent. You start you start clutching. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4216.04s)]
*  You start you start having famine instincts. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4218.2s)]
*  And like, oh, my God, what if it all goes away? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4220.84s)]
*  So they start doing things that you think will ensure that it doesn't go away. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4222.72s)]
*  Well, it's that feeling you feel like you're running a scam. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4226.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. Because also it's something especially with stand up. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4228.76s)]
*  Putting a price on things is so strange when you're like, well, I've done it [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4233.28s)]
*  more than anything. I've done it for free. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4237.24s)]
*  Yeah. Then second most, I've done it for pennies. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4239.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's like the same. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4244.4s)]
*  It's interesting to be like, well, I've done the same job for fifty dollars [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4245.72s)]
*  that I've done for one hundred thousand dollars. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4249.2s)]
*  You know, I mean, like it's strange, like it's a strange place to be. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4251.12s)]
*  And so but it's because you do feel like, well, what's what's it going to take [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4254.76s)]
*  until I'm back to like, you know, hey, you want to come do one hundred dollars? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4258.68s)]
*  I still get affected. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4262.16s)]
*  And it's just young comics being young comics. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4263.6s)]
*  I don't mind it. But like as long as I've been doing it, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4265.08s)]
*  I know they just want you to come do their show. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4268.240000000001s)]
*  But they're like, hey, man, I do it Tuesdays at the, you know, at the stand [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4269.76s)]
*  at six p.m. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4274.04s)]
*  Like, let me come back and throw you a hundred bucks and stuff like that. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4275.6s)]
*  You're like, why do you think I'm going to come? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4278.240000000001s)]
*  And why are you naming the money? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4280.52s)]
*  Like if you just had me do the show, I'd be less hurt if you were like, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4283.2s)]

*  I'm so bad at like it's my the tough time I have with Kill Tony. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4323.5199999999995s)]
*  I love doing it. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4327.639999999999s)]
*  And I always have a great time. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4328.76s)]
*  But like the initial like just going at somebody like I feel like I want to, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4329.92s)]
*  especially if I want to come out of the gates and make fun of them, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4334.28s)]
*  I almost have to have the look over of like, I'm just fucking around. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4336.04s)]
*  Yeah. I know it's so difficult what you're doing right now. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4339.0s)]
*  I'm in a comedy under the stress of how big that show is now. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4341.68s)]
*  And for some of them, it's the first time they've ever gone on stage. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4344.56s)]
*  So we're some guys, the first time they ever went on stage, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4348.8s)]
*  they went on stage in Madison Square Garden. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4350.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4352.88s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4353.56s)]
*  16000 people and they followed dice. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4354.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4360.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4361.2s)]
*  Look at your phone for notes. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4362.839999999999s)]
*  Hang on, Madison Square Garden. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4364.5199999999995s)]
*  You barely can get to the one minute mark. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4365.879999999999s)]
*  What you practice in the mirror is just everything's falling apart. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4368.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4372.16s)]
*  The running out of time. That was the funniest. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4373.16s)]
*  Oh, like, well, this is three minutes of material or 30 seconds. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4374.96s)]
*  It doesn't go the way I think. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4378.5199999999995s)]
*  Cricket, cricket, Jesus, panic. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4379.879999999999s)]
*  Isn't that the biggest? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4381.92s)]
*  To me, I felt like the biggest milestone in comedy, the action of it, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4384.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, was not being afraid of quiet, like the crowd being dead silent. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4389.24s)]
*  Even if I said something that I thought was funny and they're still dead silent, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4393.28s)]
*  that not being like frazzling, you know, I don't get shaken by that. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4396.52s)]
*  That's confidence from a lot of big sets, a lot of sets where you killed. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4400.64s)]
*  So you're like, I know I'm good. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4404.72s)]
*  Well, that's what it is. It has to believe a thing. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4406.12s)]
*  It's like I haven't. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4407.8s)]
*  It's also like I haven't conveyed it right then. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4409.88s)]
*  Like, it's me, probably. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4412.92s)]
*  But like, they're not just getting what I'm thinking. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4414.08s)]
*  If they if they just saw my thoughts right now, they'd get how funny this is. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4415.92s)]
*  Well, here's the thing, too. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4419.8s)]
*  The you know, you're going to run into a jazz crowd every now and then. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4421.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, sure. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4426.08s)]
*  Like when you go to see music, you go to see a band. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4427.12s)]
*  You go to see rock and roll. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4430.400000000001s)]
*  You go to whatever club you're going to go. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4431.56s)]
*  You go to the whiskey. It's a rock band. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4433.12s)]
*  We know we're going to go see this blues guy. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4435.08s)]
*  We know we're going to see a country guy. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4437.0s)]
*  You go see comedy. You could get. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4438.96s)]

*  You can get all kinds of shit when you go see comedy. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4447.48s)]
*  There's so many different styles to call it one thing. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4449.64s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4452.32s)]
*  And you could you could be a rock and roll guy. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4453.32s)]
*  And you're on stage in front of a jazz crowd. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4456.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And they don't want your bullshit. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4458.16s)]
*  They don't like how loud you're being. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4459.88s)]
*  Why are you moving so much? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4461.2s)]
*  No, it's what we're here to snicker. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4462.8s)]
*  You know, I stopped putting in at one point for the [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4464.76s)]
*  the small room at the stand when I was in town for the weekends [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4468.76s)]
*  because this is no fault of theirs. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4472.24s)]
*  I know they're just booking me because I'm home and they want me on the shows [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4475.360000000001s)]
*  that I can do. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4478.04s)]
*  But they would put those shows they would book the. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4479.280000000001s)]
*  With the the tick tock like celebrity girls, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4483.320000000001s)]
*  like girl comics that were brand new in comedy, but drew the audience. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4487.16s)]
*  And they were and they're also young enough in comedy [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4491.72s)]
*  that they're posting their spots. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4493.52s)]
*  Oh, my God. You know, I mean, like, they're not. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4495.4400000000005s)]
*  They want to see my schedule is like here. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4496.84s)]
*  So the room is filling up for them. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4499.280000000001s)]
*  And I go up to me in the second I get on stage. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4501.200000000001s)]
*  You'd see the face and groans of like just like [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4503.320000000001s)]
*  a man's going to come what laid out now. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4507.88s)]
*  And I would even try to play with that idea. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4510.68s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? Like explain what's going on in the room. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4513.56s)]
*  And they would just they tend to my last one ever doing up there. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4516.0s)]
*  There was an Asian girl in the front row that I was [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4519.88s)]
*  fucking with, like going back and forth with her. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4523.96s)]
*  But she was great. She was like into it. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4526.200000000001s)]
*  She was laughing and she was busting balls back a little bit, which was fine. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4528.280000000001s)]
*  You know, she was kind of like playing around with it. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4531.56s)]
*  And then I see another girl, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4534.64s)]
*  you know, 22 years old or whatever, 23 going into her phone. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4537.56s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I lost you already. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4540.68s)]
*  I go, I lost you. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4542.92s)]
*  And she goes, maybe it has something to do with the Asian girl thing. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4544.120000000001s)]
*  And I was like, what? Because you called her Asian girl. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4549.040000000001s)]
*  I was like, wait, but she's fine. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4551.96s)]
*  I go, are you you're getting upset on her behalf and she's fine. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4553.96s)]
*  And she was like, yeah. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4558.88s)]
*  And I was like, that's retarded. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4560.72s)]
*  And then a lady in the back of the room stood up, lady, a girl, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4562.24s)]
*  and literally clutched her jacket together and went, you just said the R word. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4565.44s)]
*  And I went, the manager was in the room and I was like, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4570.72s)]
*  take me off the schedule for the rest of this weekend up here. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4573.72s)]
*  I go, I'm not even mad at this crowd. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4575.48s)]
*  I'm like, they you have to give this crowd what they want. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4577.36s)]
*  If you put on a three week open mic gay comic up here right now, he'd murder. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4580.16s)]
*  Like read the room of what you're booking. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4585.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like you have to see what's happening. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4587.84s)]
*  It's like you're putting me up there. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4589.48s)]
*  This isn't fun for me. And it's not fair to that. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4590.92s)]
*  Like they've been sold a show that's not what I do. Right. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4593.08s)]
*  So I don't have any kind of gripe on them. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4596.64s)]
*  It's like, don't put me on those shows. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4598.16s)]
*  Yeah, you shouldn't be on that show. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4599.44s)]
*  What does people do? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4600.96s)]
*  You're you're fucking up your own. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4601.76s)]
*  Your audience is actually going to like the club less [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4602.96s)]
*  because they think I'm the piece of shit that's always here. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4605.72s)]
*  But then there's another argument where you got to kind of do [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4608.44s)]
*  all kinds of crowds, of course, because if you only do your own crowd, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4611.679999999999s)]
*  like one of the things that happens to guys is they start doing theaters [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4615.04s)]
*  and they do real well and then they bring a lame opening act [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4619.719999999999s)]
*  and then they're only playing to their crowd. Oh, yeah. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4623.04s)]
*  And you see the drop off. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4625.0s)]
*  You see this like weird creativity drop off. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4626.24s)]
*  You see the weird impact and not killing is hard. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4628.32s)]
*  Everything's a little fake and forced. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4630.719999999999s)]
*  And it's it's pretty noticeable and normal. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4632.48s)]
*  It's like normal. It happens a lot. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4635.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're not doing clubs, I was going to say, if you're in theaters, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4637.64s)]
*  you're removed from the audience. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4640.240000000001s)]
*  You got to mix it up. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4641.56s)]
*  You have to be doing little little room sometimes. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4642.68s)]
*  I think it's like if you're an athlete, you have to lift weights. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4645.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? I think there's there's something to that. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4647.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I like to go [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4650.200000000001s)]
*  do crowds that aren't my crowds plenty. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4652.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? I mean, but I mean, just different sizes, too. Right. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4655.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Without a doubt. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4658.84s)]
*  Yeah. Sometimes like one of the great things about the store [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4659.68s)]
*  was like you could come in there on an off night, like a Tuesday night [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4662.76s)]
*  and do like a one a.m. set. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4666.32s)]
*  When you're doing a one a.m. set, there's like 25 fucking people in the room. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4668.599999999999s)]
*  And you just like you get the and they've seen everything. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4672.24s)]
*  They've seen five hours of fucking stand up. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4676.2s)]
*  They came from Kansas. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4678.92s)]
*  They've seen five hours of comedy and most of the audience is gone. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4680.0s)]
*  It's a shame from a comics perspective. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4682.92s)]
*  I mean, from a business perspective, it's great. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4685.36s)]
*  But like the comedy seller, like it's funny for people to not even know anymore. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4687.0s)]
*  Or remember, there was a time when I got into the comedy cellar, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4692.0s)]
*  there was still when you went on at two o'clock in the morning, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4694.16s)]
*  there could be 15 people in the audience. Right. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4696.88s)]
*  And now it's show lets people out another show, another show. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4698.76s)]
*  So it's like it's it's always sold out and packed. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4702.68s)]
*  But like there was something to that was kind of like that was the training ground. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4705.44s)]
*  I go up after David Tell almost every night of the week [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4708.8s)]
*  in front of 15 people was like that was great training. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4711.88s)]
*  You do need that for sure. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4715.08s)]
*  And I still need that. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4716.28s)]
*  It's not so much that I just saying the couch. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4717.8s)]
*  I said, take me out of that room because it's always this audience. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4720.32s)]
*  And it's just like you're putting them through a thing. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4723.36s)]
*  They don't need to be put through. Right. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4725.88s)]
*  That's what downstairs isn't my audience either. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4727.28s)]
*  I'm just like, just put me in the room where it's not been sold. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4730.08s)]
*  Is this one thing? Right. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4733.28s)]
*  Well, that's that's the problem with like some clubs that have restrictions [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4735.16s)]
*  on what you could say on the stage. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4738.68s)]
*  Like, why? No, no, no. You just can't book this guy. Right. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4740.28s)]
*  Like there's a club. Where is it? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4743.76s)]
*  And is it in Portland or Seattle? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4745.08s)]
*  There's some club that these guys got to. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4748.04s)]
*  Duncan got to and he sent me a photo of a list of all the things [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4750.679999999999s)]
*  that you can talk about. We don't tolerate at this club. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4754.88s)]
*  We don't tolerate racism, sexism, transphobia. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4757.08s)]
*  Like, OK, I wonder if it's the one that like I don't know what it is. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4760.12s)]
*  We don't probably don't even say need to say the name. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4764.16s)]
*  Oh, I don't know the name of the people in trouble. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4766.48s)]
*  I don't know the name of the place, but there is a. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4767.759999999999s)]
*  But just don't book people that you know what the fuck they do. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4769.32s)]
*  And don't book anybody that's not you. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4772.96s)]
*  If you have a specific crowd you're trying to cater to, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4775.12s)]
*  that's your prerogative. No problem with that. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4779.72s)]
*  Sure. Just book the comedians that fit. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4782.120000000001s)]
*  Don't don't like have a list of shit someone can't say once they get there. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4784.6s)]
*  Like, also, raise assume that if you're booking somebody, though, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4788.92s)]
*  that you'd have to put those rules for it's like you have to like. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4792.400000000001s)]
*  I always like that thing. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4795.400000000001s)]
*  It's like trust the comic to be like a professional. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4796.160000000001s)]
*  Not that they'll always come through in that regard, but like, you know, [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4798.52s)]
*  you could put you can put me on stage anywhere and assume it's not going to end [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4802.120000000001s)]
*  with me being going to fuck you, fuck you with the audience. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4805.04s)]
*  Right. I mean, like, we'll get out of it. Right. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4807.56s)]
*  You'll have relatively pleasant. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4809.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, you're a guy that's very flexible on stage, which is just a huge benefit. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4810.68s)]
*  You can always fuck around with people and engage with the crowd. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4815.200000000001s)]
*  But you're so good at it. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4818.6s)]
*  You're one of the best in the business at it for sure. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4820.120000000001s)]
*  You're really good at it. But it's also fun and jovial. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4822.360000000001s)]
*  You know how to tie it all together. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4825.160000000001s)]
*  That's a giant skill if you're doing a bunch of different kinds of rooms [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4827.040000000001s)]
*  and different kinds of places. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4831.040000000001s)]
*  But when when a club owner or someone says that you can't breach [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4832.400000000001s)]
*  certain topics, because that's what you're saying. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4836.6s)]
*  If you're saying we don't tolerate racism. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4838.8s)]
*  Listen, I don't either. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4841.4400000000005s)]
*  But that's not what jokes are. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4843.240000000001s)]
*  And there's a way to touch on race [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4844.96s)]
*  that a super ultra sensitive person would say is racism. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4848.4800000000005s)]
*  And another person who's more objective would say, no, this is just making fun [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4852.0s)]
*  of the differences we all have and how crazy it is that we would think [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4856.120000000001s)]
*  that any one is superior to the others. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4860.56s)]
*  There's ways to do that. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4862.160000000001s)]
*  And to say that, you know, that's racist. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4863.84s)]
*  We don't tolerate racism like, well, it would you what do you call it? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4866.0s)]
*  So you can't just define what you can't define hate speech [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4869.84s)]
*  because that's your definition. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4873.92s)]
*  You force me to go with your definition. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4875.48s)]
*  Yeah, can't be opinion based. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4878.56s)]
*  It can't. So you just got to let people speak freely. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4880.08s)]
*  And then you decide who you book or don't book. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4883.76s)]
*  But no, what the fuck they do. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4886.16s)]
*  That's part of your job. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4887.92s)]
*  Part of your job as someone who books a fucking theater is, OK, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4889.84s)]
*  if you have the theater, you own the theater. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4894.16s)]
*  You don't want anybody come performing that doesn't meet your expectations. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4896.2s)]
*  That's great. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4899.68s)]
*  One of the funniest things is I'm always blown away by [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4900.599999999999s)]
*  is the people in the audience who. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4904.4s)]
*  Are hating the show, which is fine, that happens. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4907.48s)]
*  You know, some people come and they didn't know what they were coming to. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4910.16s)]
*  Sure, girlfriends get dragged. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4912.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, cast fan, which I also tend to like take their side. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4914.2s)]
*  If I see that happening, I try to do that. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4917.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, why do you make it come to you? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4919.04s)]
*  No, why do you put you through this kind of thing? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4920.28s)]
*  Is a is how I will usually approach that. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4922.679999999999s)]
*  But when you see those faces, when they if someone like that gets shitty [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4925.32s)]
*  and stuff, it's I'm always surprised how aggressive they are [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4929.719999999999s)]
*  when they realize that they're the the minority. Right. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4933.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's like, I don't know, because you're you suck and you're not funny. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4937.36s)]
*  It's such a funny thing to shift. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4940.36s)]
*  How much you can make that person an enemy of the room by just going, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4942.48s)]
*  she's saying all of you are stupid as shit because you're laughing at it. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4945.44s)]
*  Then they'll hate her for you. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4949.839999999999s)]
*  Well, there's always going to be a you suck and you're not funny person in the world. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4952.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's a skill you have to get that poor girl, that poor girl [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4955.52s)]
*  and that had the video of her skits and out on the guy in the audience. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4958.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4963.0s)]
*  That was that was on people piled on on her, which was actually fucked up. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4964.76s)]
*  Well, she was like death. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4968.96s)]
*  Why would you death threaten someone who had a bad time on stage? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4971.0s)]
*  It seems weird. But she but again, that's the that's the situation of [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4973.2s)]
*  getting an audience [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4977.72s)]
*  before you're ready to handle all situations, because the thing about that [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4981.120000000001s)]
*  was the heckle in that video is [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4984.080000000001s)]
*  I mean, heckling 101, like the thing you should be able to handle [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4987.96s)]
*  is someone going, you're not funny. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4991.040000000001s)]
*  I'm funny. You want me to tell the joke? Like, give me the microphone. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=4993.040000000001s)]

*  Especially when it's a joke that's been told for like 10 years. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5162.92s)]
*  And you can't be pissed about this. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5165.0s)]

*  This is a part of the bit. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5188.719999999999s)]

*  They will not believe it might be proof of the simulation. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5206.52s)]
*  That video might be proof of the simulation because it just doesn't make sense. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5209.84s)]
*  Is it like unless God has some amazing sense of humor, some amazing sense of humor. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5213.76s)]

*  Well, he found me in Boston. He was a New York guy. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5366.92s)]
*  And that's why I moved to New York. No shit. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5368.8s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't even supposed to go on stage that night. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5370.68s)]
*  Oh, so lucky because I would have panicked and I would have choked. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5372.240000000001s)]
*  I didn't know he was in the room. I had no idea. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5375.88s)]
*  So he had come. He was he used to manage Bob Nelson. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5378.04s)]
*  Remember Bob Nelson? Yeah. Hell yeah. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5380.92s)]
*  So Bob Nelson, Philly guy, I believe he became very Christian. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5382.64s)]
*  And he was going to have his his Bible partner, his his guy, become his manager. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5386.6s)]
*  He had this guy that they were brothers in Christ. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5392.08s)]
*  And so Sussman was looking for new clients and he thought he saw everybody [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5395.12s)]
*  that he could see in New York at the time. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5399.12s)]
*  And so he had a good friend that was taking a trip to Boston. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5401.8s)]
*  And so he went with him and he said, I'm going to, you know, set up some [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5405.6s)]
*  shows at some of these comedy clubs. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5409.4s)]
*  So they had all the local Boston headliners, like big name guys [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5411.0s)]
*  from the town would all perform for them. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5415.24s)]
*  And I was working driving limos at the time. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5418.28s)]
*  And I while I was driving, I would come up with some of my best ideas sometimes [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5421.48s)]
*  because, you know, you didn't listen to the radio, just drive [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5426.36s)]
*  because you couldn't listen to the radio. We had clients. Yeah. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5429.44s)]
*  And so some of my best ideas came from just driving around. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5432.08s)]
*  I had this fucking idea. I'm like, oh, my God, I think this would work. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5435.4s)]
*  And so I called up my friend who was the manager. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5438.4s)]
*  And I said, hey, dude, do you think I could get a guest spot tonight? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5442.12s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, absolutely. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5445.0s)]
*  So he hooks me up. I have no idea. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5446.36s)]
*  I go downstairs. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5448.64s)]
*  This guy who becomes my manager is walking out of the room [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5449.76s)]
*  to go to another club, which is down the street. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5453.64s)]
*  And he hears me killing. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5456.5199999999995s)]
*  And so he comes back downstairs and he watches my whole set. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5458.44s)]
*  And I would have never done what I did. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5461.12s)]
*  How are you doing comedy at this point? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5462.68s)]
*  Three years. That's fast. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5465.6s)]
*  Yeah, three years. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5467.64s)]
*  So but I was pretty I had some good sex jokes. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5468.88s)]
*  I had some great jokes that would kill. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5474.400000000001s)]
*  And I would have never done them if he was in the room. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5476.52s)]
*  I would because everybody had to be clean back then. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5478.76s)]
*  That was like, you got to be clean. You got to be clean. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5480.6s)]
*  And I was like, you had good success in like acting. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5482.76s)]
*  Was that your when you got into it was I know when I got into it, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5486.76s)]
*  I thought was interesting was I started to do standup comedy. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5489.96s)]
*  It took me a long time to realize that I love broadcasting. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5493.400000000001s)]
*  I think it scratches the same itch for me broadcasting is what I did. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5495.8s)]
*  But I didn't never get into it to act or all these different other things. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5499.16s)]
*  So but as soon as you get into it, especially when you have a manager, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5502.72s)]
*  you just see the industry unfold. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5506.08s)]
*  You see everyone's like, you don't have a commercial agent. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5508.0s)]
*  You got to go out and audition for commercials. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5509.92s)]
*  All these things that I was like supplementary that I was like, [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5511.320000000001s)]
*  instead of doing that, I'm just going to keep doing the black circuit [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5515.2s)]
*  because I make some money there. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5517.360000000001s)]
*  Like I was getting a couple of bucks, you know, enough to survive [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5518.4800000000005s)]
*  on shows and that. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5522.360000000001s)]
*  And then I'll just go hang out the mainstream rooms, you know, at night [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5523.2s)]
*  and meet all the comics and get on when I can get on. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5526.92s)]
*  But like it was never [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5529.04s)]
*  I just never like I would not go so many times to a demo. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5531.2s)]
*  I don't fucking. Yeah, I did a couple. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5534.16s)]
*  I don't want I don't want it. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5535.72s)]
*  And I ended up sitting on a show for two years. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5536.76s)]
*  And it was a great experience in hindsight. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5538.5599999999995s)]
*  But like what showed you going on? It's called Z Rock. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5540.16s)]
*  It was a IFC show. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5542.5199999999995s)]
*  What was great about it for me was because [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5544.2s)]
*  it was the Kirby enthusiasm style writing. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5547.32s)]
*  So we get to say whatever we wanted, really. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5550.12s)]
*  And it was cursing and there was no problems with that. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5552.08s)]
*  So it was a very fun show to do in that regard. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5554.56s)]
*  But it's getting just wasn't my wasn't your thing. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5556.56s)]
*  In fact, when I when I was doing it, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5559.0s)]
*  I would still go like three of the nights a week. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5563.5199999999995s)]
*  We do five shows every other night. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5565.76s)]
*  I would still go do my spot to sell her. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5567.24s)]
*  And she was giving me two AM spots. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5568.96s)]
*  And I have to be on set at seven AM, you know, six AM sometimes. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5571.48s)]
*  And when they would get like, you know, I would take naps [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5575.92s)]
*  in between like scenes or whatever. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5577.68s)]
*  And they would be like, why are you going and doing like standup so late? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5579.92s)]
*  I'm like, oh, because this show will not be forever. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5583.4400000000005s)]
*  And there is 50 people waiting to jump in my spot there. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5586.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm established there right now. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5589.4800000000005s)]
*  So it's like when this goes away, that's the thing that's still going to be there. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5591.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I definitely made sure. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5595.76s)]
*  And so I said, but also I didn't want to really be an actor. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5597.52s)]
*  Well, in the 90s, it was just a money thing. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5599.88s)]
*  You know, it was everybody. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5602.92s)]
*  There was two things that everybody wanted as if you were a comic deal. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5605.52s)]
*  No, you wanted to be the head of a sitcom or you wanted to host The Tonight Show. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5609.759999999999s)]
*  Those are the two things that everybody wanted, which is why Jay Leno. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5613.799999999999s)]
*  People to this day don't understand, like, why did Jay Leno want The Tonight Show [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5616.759999999999s)]
*  so bad that he was like hiding in the closet and, you know, that whole story [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5619.679999999999s)]
*  where they're negotiating and, you know, he just they scratched and clawed [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5622.759999999999s)]
*  and everybody was mad at him because he took it from Conan. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5626.92s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5629.16s)]
*  And like, well, because he went back because Conan's ratings weren't as good. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5629.719999999999s)]
*  All that craziness was that was the golden carrot at the end of the stick. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5633.4s)]
*  Everybody wants to in our minds. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5637.4s)]
*  Everybody wanted to host The Tonight Show or you wanted to be Jerry Seinfeld. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5639.5199999999995s)]
*  So that was what you got. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5644.599999999999s)]
*  Like and so these people came there and that's all the industry talked about, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5645.88s)]
*  because that's where all the money was. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5649.2s)]
*  That's what your agent wanted you to do. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5650.48s)]
*  That's where all the money was. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5652.36s)]
*  And everybody just pushing you in that direction. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5653.639999999999s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's what it is. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5655.719999999999s)]
*  It was like it was a bit of a push in that direction, because it was like you're. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5656.839999999999s)]
*  But it's an antiquated idea that comes from the time [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5659.599999999999s)]
*  of like everyone in entertainment was like a triple threat. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5663.16s)]
*  I watched something a while ago that was like a Jamie Foxx. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5666.96s)]
*  But you're right. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5669.68s)]
*  But even go back to like the Sinatra's and they said a Barney Miller, Howlinden. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5670.44s)]
*  There's videos of him like singing on. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5675.56s)]
*  He went on on like talk shows and as a singer. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5677.8s)]
*  Wow. Because everyone had to like dance. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5680.64s)]
*  You were like a showman. Right. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5682.72s)]
*  There was no like from the olden days in one direction. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5684.2s)]
*  Yeah. So the idea, the idea that you were like, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5687.0s)]
*  I came into comedy as a mega fan of stand up comedy. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5690.24s)]
*  I loved all of it. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5694.2s)]
*  I didn't even like draw lines on, you know, the people I like more than others. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5695.36s)]
*  And Dice was my guy for sure when I was 12, 13. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5699.2s)]
*  I just hit him at the right time. Yeah. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5702.5599999999995s)]
*  But I loved that. But I was such a fan of stand up. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5704.4s)]
*  Then when I got in a stand up, I only saw like now I didn't know what the path was [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5706.32s)]
*  to selling out comedy clubs or theaters or anything like that. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5709.96s)]
*  But that's all it was. I didn't get into this. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5714.48s)]
*  I was like, oh, and then I'll have a sitcom. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5716.04s)]
*  And then you get told right away like, well, what year did you come along? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5718.48s)]
*  You're going. What year did you come along? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5721.719999999999s)]
*  I started in 90, 97. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5723.16s)]
*  OK, so maybe 98. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5727.36s)]
*  That was like the peak of the sitcom days. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5728.76s)]
*  That was Friends. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5731.88s)]
*  That was that was everything was still on the air back then. Right. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5733.32s)]
*  Seinfeld had when what year did Seinfeld end? [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5737.08s)]
*  I want to say that was like 2000. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5740.48s)]
*  No, 98. Yeah, I was going to say 98. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5743.08s)]
*  98. Yeah. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5746.88s)]
*  OK. And then there's Friends, which kept going a little while longer. Right. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5752.08s)]
*  You know, and then there was like Caroline in the city. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5758.28s)]
*  There was like all these shows that everybody was like. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5760.64s)]
*  That was the goal. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5765.32s)]
*  The goal was to get on a show and everybody wanted and everybody got a network deal. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5766.32s)]
*  They were handing out deals where you would get like a couple hundred grand. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5770.2s)]
*  You didn't have to do anything. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5772.96s)]
*  And they never even made a show and they get another deal next year. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5773.84s)]
*  There's a bunch of guys who were always having deals. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5776.04s)]
*  And that a lot of those people, when I got in the comedy, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5778.12s)]
*  I'd see those people like chest out at the comic strip. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5780.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And stuff. But then but then. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5784.28s)]
*  Never heard of it. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5787.4800000000005s)]
*  Not to me, I wouldn't know names, but I mean, it was just weird to see people [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5788.24s)]
*  that were like, oh, they just got their second deal with NBC holding deal or. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5791.32s)]
*  Yeah. Although I convinced it was going to go, they would tell you, like, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5795.36s)]
*  I got a million dollar backup deal and this and that. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5798.08s)]
*  So they have to do my show. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5800.6s)]
*  It's going to be on the air. You should play my brother. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5801.88s)]
*  And then it doesn't. It's such a. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5803.6s)]
*  Well, you see people getting really weird and acting like they're special [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5805.84s)]
*  before they're even famous. Sure. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5810.24s)]
*  You didn't even get on the launching pad yet. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5812.0s)]
*  And you're already acting like a fucking crazy person. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5813.96s)]
*  But also a lot of that. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5816.04s)]
*  I saw I've been doing it long enough to see people kind of go and be like, shit. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5817.04s)]
*  The acting thing seems to be going. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5821.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'm going to go to L.A. or something in entertainment. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5824.0s)]
*  Like, besides, standup is going. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5827.2s)]
*  And they focus on that for a couple of years and then nothing really pans out from it. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5829.44s)]
*  And they didn't keep doing standup. Right. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5832.5199999999995s)]
*  And then they come back and try again. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5834.5599999999995s)]
*  And then they're confused because. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5836.72s)]
*  I've never had my own sitcom, I've never had anything, but like [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5839.240000000001s)]
*  one thing I never stopped doing was like working the whole time still. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5842.280000000001s)]
*  So it's like you're building a fan base still. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5845.68s)]
*  And when people a lot of people left at a time where it was like, oh, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5848.0s)]
*  this is where you have to start, you know, they went to go to acting when everyone [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5851.200000000001s)]
*  was like, all right, this is it's podcast times now and social media times. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5853.8s)]
*  And you have to get all these things going [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5857.96s)]
*  and connect with the audience and stuff and keep performing. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5860.84s)]
*  And like they went away and then come back. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5863.280000000001s)]
*  And it's hard to start again. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5864.6s)]
*  It's real hard. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5866.28s)]
*  They saw a lot of guys during the writer's strike tried to do it again. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5867.12s)]
*  Because there's a few of those guys that are really good, that are just writers. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5870.08s)]
*  And they become they become trapped in that velvet prison of getting that. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5874.759999999999s)]
*  You know, you make good money. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5879.719999999999s)]
*  You got a great health plan. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5882.48s)]
*  You got a nice house, got a mortgage, maybe start having kids. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5883.96s)]
*  And you're not really a comic anymore. Right. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5886.599999999999s)]
*  You're working on a sitcom or you're writing. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5889.08s)]
*  And the problem is you don't have a backup plan anymore [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5891.32s)]
*  because you can't just go on the road anymore because you don't have a fucking audience. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5895.08s)]
*  Right. So all those other guys that you came up with that kept their comedy up [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5898.04s)]
*  during that whole time, those guys can still tour like Fitzsimmons was very smart about it. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5901.64s)]
*  Like Fitzsimmons did a lot of writing, but he never stopped doing stand up. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5906.44s)]
*  So never stopped doing stand up. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5910.6s)]
*  And he always kept getting better. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5912.44s)]
*  And so like when writer strikes and things like that happen, Greg's fine. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5914.08s)]
*  Like he sells out all over the country. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5917.68s)]
*  He doesn't have to worry about it. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5920.04s)]
*  But it's because he's smart and because he like saw the writing on the wall. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5921.0s)]
*  Like I'm not falling into this trap. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5924.4s)]
*  Well, it's a matter of what you want to do. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5926.48s)]
*  When you woke up in the mornings to go do news radio, were you like [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5927.719999999999s)]
*  thrilled going to work every day or did it? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5931.92s)]
*  What did it? Did it? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5934.0s)]
*  No, news radio was really fun. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5935.12s)]
*  It was really fun. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5937.12s)]
*  It was a cast is crazy. It was really fun. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5938.32s)]
*  It was a it was a real fun like environment. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5940.679999999999s)]
*  We had a good time. The writers were amazing. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5943.879999999999s)]
*  It was like perfect. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5946.799999999999s)]
*  Best case scenario for a sitcom. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5948.0s)]
*  And there was the second sitcom I was on. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5950.44s)]
*  The first one I was on was like worst case scenario. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5952.36s)]
*  Not worst, but started off great. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5954.719999999999s)]
*  It was on the show called Hardball with Jim Brewer. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5957.28s)]
*  Jim Brewer was he played one of the rival [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5960.32s)]
*  mascots and he gets beat up. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5964.5599999999995s)]
*  It's Jim was so funny. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5966.88s)]
*  It was so funny. It was a real funny pilot. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5968.839999999999s)]
*  And it was written by these guys who worked on Married with Children. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5970.88s)]
*  And they worked on The Simpsons. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5974.28s)]
*  They were really funny writers, Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5975.679999999999s)]
*  And these guys put together this really funny show. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5978.5599999999995s)]
*  And then the networks just get up. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5981.719999999999s)]
*  They just they just jizzed into the soup. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5985.28s)]
*  It was a mess. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5988.5599999999995s)]
*  They brought in a bunch of people that shouldn't have been there [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5990.08s)]
*  and a bunch of the show fell apart. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5993.08s)]
*  And but I got I got to watch like these brilliant, really funny guys [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5994.679999999999s)]
*  get their work just shit all over by the network and have it fall apart [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=5997.879999999999s)]
*  and become just a joke. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6001.48s)]
*  Could you have been roped into stopping stand up [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6003.32s)]
*  like not doing stand up to go in the full time? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6007.5599999999995s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6010.76s)]
*  I'm sick on the sitcom. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6011.68s)]
*  But one thing that I did do for sure is I neglected my stand up for a few years [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6012.6s)]
*  when I was doing news radio all the time. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6017.320000000001s)]
*  The problem was in news radio in the early days, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6020.16s)]
*  they were really long hours because we were trying to figure the show out. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6023.4400000000005s)]
*  And, you know, there was a lot of network notes back in those days. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6027.4400000000005s)]
*  And, you know, the network was really behind it, but it wasn't. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6030.8s)]
*  It wasn't owned by NBC. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6034.12s)]
*  It was it was produced by Brillstein Gray. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6036.12s)]
*  So, you know, if you wanted to be on the good slots, right? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6038.0s)]
*  So there would Paul Sims would call Paul Sims, the creator of news radio, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6042.64s)]
*  would call the shit sandwich. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6045.76s)]
*  So you'd have friends and married with children. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6047.2s)]
*  And in between, you'd have like kind of KakÃ¡ sitcoms like a shit sandwich. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6049.16s)]
*  This will be we got in those spots occasionally. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6053.4s)]
*  And every time we did, we were like number two in the country, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6055.68s)]
*  number three or something. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6057.48s)]
*  But then we dropped down like number 80 because we got moved [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6058.24s)]
*  like nine different times over five years, nine times over five years. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6061.0s)]
*  So the show didn't really become successful until one this indication. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6064.68s)]
*  Nice. So it was one of those weird things. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6068.52s)]
*  But I never auditioned for two shows ever. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6070.360000000001s)]
*  I auditioned for that hardball show. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6074.360000000001s)]
*  I got that that got canceled and auditioned for news radio. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6075.92s)]
*  That was it. Really? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6078.8s)]
*  It was the nuttiest thing of all time. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6079.64s)]
*  So I didn't want it. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6081.0s)]
*  It just happened. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6083.200000000001s)]
*  So it wasn't something like it was my golden carrot. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6084.68s)]
*  My golden carrot was just I wanted to be a professional comic. Right. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6087.080000000001s)]
*  And then I as I was like barely making money as a professional comic, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6089.68s)]
*  barely surviving. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6093.44s)]
*  All of a sudden, they're like, we'll pay you twenty five thousand dollars a week. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6094.919999999999s)]
*  I was like, what do I have to do? [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6097.44s)]
*  Well, they're going to act. OK, now I'm acting. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6098.759999999999s)]
*  And I would have moved back to New York 100 percent if I didn't get an apartment. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6100.879999999999s)]
*  So I signed a one year lease on this apartment in North Hollywood. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6104.44s)]
*  And so I was staying. I was like, I got to stay because I wanted to just go back [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6107.879999999999s)]
*  to New York and play pool and hang out with my friends. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6111.2s)]
*  I didn't like it in L.A. It wasn't my cup of tea. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6113.879999999999s)]
*  I didn't like being around actors. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6116.32s)]
*  And it was hard to make friends with some of the comedians. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6117.799999999999s)]
*  And the comedy store was weird back then. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6119.759999999999s)]
*  So I was like, I was ready to go back to New York. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6121.84s)]
*  And I had this fucking lease. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6123.88s)]
*  So I was like, I can't break the law of that kind of money. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6125.68s)]
*  I've got to keep this lease going. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6128.08s)]
*  So I stayed there and then I got news radio, like right afterwards. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6129.400000000001s)]
*  Which is great. It was crazy. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6133.04s)]
*  That's a whirlwind for sure. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6135.0s)]
*  It is funny, though, it's like just that lead of that, like that you're supposed to do. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6136.24s)]
*  Like to me, it was sitting [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6140.0s)]
*  for whatever the tenth time in a thing and watching, especially actors [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6143.64s)]
*  like walking back and forth, like how serious they're taking getting there. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6148.32s)]
*  And I'm just like holding the sides barely. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6152.68s)]
*  And I'm like, what's like three lines we got to say, like, relax. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6155.16s)]
*  And I didn't book stuff, but it's also just like, as I'm sitting there, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6158.4800000000005s)]
*  like, I don't know if I want to be the. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6161.4s)]
*  You know, the Trident cinnamon gum guy. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6163.96s)]
*  Mitch Hender, you sound a bit about. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6166.96s)]
*  I just don't like it's like if you get it, it's almost like fantastic. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6168.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, like, that's great. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6172.08s)]
*  But if you get it, it's extra money. Sure. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6173.16s)]
*  But then once you get all the extra money, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6175.4s)]
*  you don't have to really do that anymore. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6177.2s)]
*  And that's when you got to decide, like what do you like? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6178.679999999999s)]
*  One of the things that I had to decide after I did Fear Factor, I was like, OK, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6181.12s)]
*  no more of that, please. Yeah. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6184.0s)]
*  I did it one more time. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6186.04s)]
*  I did it one more time when in 2011, Fear Factor came back for a brief amount of time. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6187.08s)]
*  And that's when they made people drink. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6191.92s)]
*  Chiz, I guess, got canceled forever until Ludacris came back and did it on MTV. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6192.96s)]
*  No, just those in the no, just they toned it down back then. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6199.32s)]
*  But it was just like there's a different thing that's happening [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6202.96s)]
*  when you're doing something just for money, you know, you're just like, OK, it's worth it. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6206.68s)]
*  It's worth it for this amount of money. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6210.08s)]
*  And then you got to know what to do with that money. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6211.6s)]
*  But I used to have to plan your escape. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6215.360000000001s)]
*  I used to have to like, like talk myself into like when I would get those [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6217.4400000000005s)]
*  we're like talking head shows. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6222.08s)]
*  I think on History Channel, we did like I love they were trying to do [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6223.4400000000005s)]
*  like a spoof of I love the 80s and I love the 90s. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6225.92s)]
*  They would do I love the 1880s or I love the 1890s or whatever. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6229.360000000001s)]
*  And they would give us like history stories and write jokes. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6233.6s)]
*  You're going to talking head things. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6236.32s)]
*  And I would look at it as a burden of that next day. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6238.0s)]
*  I got to wake up at eight to go into the city and like [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6241.36s)]
*  to do this thing that's never I look at all the stuff and I'm like, it's [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6244.599999999999s)]
*  it's network, it's History Channel. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6247.16s)]
*  So it's like I can't really do exactly what it is I do. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6249.0s)]
*  And then because I'm going to go as close as I can to my own voice, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6252.28s)]
*  that like it's probably not going to get a lot of stuff on anyway. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6256.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And but I really convinced myself like, you know, [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6259.719999999999s)]
*  there was a kid across the street from me [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6263.72s)]
*  when I lived in South Jersey for the couple of years, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6267.04s)]
*  who was in a Froot Loops commercial, I said, and he and he said, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6268.92s)]
*  he might as well been Brad Pitt. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6271.84s)]
*  You know, I mean, like to me, I was like, he's been on television. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6273.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, think I'm going to do a TV show tomorrow. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6275.76s)]
*  History Channel, anything. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6279.08s)]
*  Have you told me when I was 12, 13 years old that, hey, you want to do a TV show, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6279.96s)]
*  be on TV, on the history channel, you'd be like, no TV. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6283.240000000001s)]
*  Is that possible? You know, so you have to remember that it is pretty like [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6285.84s)]
*  extraordinary to have some of these opportunities. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6289.56s)]
*  But man, so I try to take them in when I have them. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6291.6s)]
*  I did. I was in the movie Hustlers as the strip club DJ. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6294.120000000001s)]
*  What is Hustlers? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6297.52s)]
*  It's a it's a true story of the girls at scores who were like [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6298.360000000001s)]
*  robbed the strippers that were robbing the really. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6302.240000000001s)]
*  When did that movie come out? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6304.200000000001s)]
*  A couple of years back now. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6305.4800000000005s)]
*  But shit, maybe like seven years, six, seven years ago. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6306.76s)]
*  But I was the strip club DJ in that. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6310.64s)]
*  And like I really had to. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6312.4800000000005s)]
*  Go there, because I look at that in hindsight of it, it's like [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6314.96s)]
*  it was two 14 hour days of like nothing, so much nothing going on. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6317.759999999999s)]
*  Right. You just waiting around. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6323.2s)]
*  Yeah. And just whiffing when I had these opportunities. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6324.719999999999s)]
*  But I'm also trying to take in. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6328.04s)]
*  I'm like, holy shit, that's usher over there. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6329.2s)]
*  And that's fucking jail. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6331.36s)]
*  It's as I'm sitting here like, when do you guys need me again? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6332.879999999999s)]
*  It's like JLo's in a thong, like, you know, twerking on stage, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6336.48s)]

*  I tried to talk to her once and I whiffed hard. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6415.4800000000005s)]
*  Did you? I just get panicked. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6417.320000000001s)]
*  I planned to thought you could be number six. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6419.56s)]
*  I planned what I was going to say. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6421.56s)]
*  That's the problem was. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6423.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, you did. Yeah. How bad? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6424.56s)]
*  I it was bad. I said when she next time she turns around, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6426.6s)]
*  because she seems nice, she's going to like at some point, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6430.280000000001s)]
*  she's going to talk to me. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6432.8s)]
*  We're doing this one scene together where she hands me money. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6433.56s)]

*  And every time the yell cut, she put a robe on, turn around, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6438.52s)]
*  talk to her assistant. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6441.92s)]
*  But I'm like, she does seem nice. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6442.88s)]
*  And she's going to turn around and ask me some version of how you doing. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6444.0s)]
*  And I'm going to say, you know, I'm just living the life of a fake [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6447.32s)]
*  strip club DJ, and that's going to make her giggle. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6450.64s)]
*  And then we're best friends for life. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6453.0s)]
*  And instead of waiting for her to say anything, the next time she just [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6454.76s)]
*  her eyes just crossed my eyes. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6457.4800000000005s)]
*  I went, living the life of a fake strip club. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6458.72s)]
*  She like followed her face. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6460.4400000000005s)]
*  And she was like, excuse me. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6463.08s)]
*  And I was like, oh, and then her assistant started laughing at me. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6464.56s)]
*  And then I demanded to go outside to get a soda. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6468.080000000001s)]
*  They were like, we'll get you a soda. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6470.120000000001s)]
*  I'm like, please let me go outside and reset this moment. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6471.120000000001s)]
*  I hate this. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6474.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't have a diva roll her eyes at you. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6477.6s)]
*  That'll fuck your confidence up. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6480.400000000001s)]
*  No matter who you are. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6482.240000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6483.320000000001s)]
*  Jennifer Lopez rolls her eyes at you. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6483.96s)]
*  That's it hurts so much. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6485.56s)]
*  How she looks so good. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6486.88s)]
*  I don't know what she really did. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6488.56s)]
*  It's pretty extraordinary. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6490.0s)]
*  It's that thing. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6491.0s)]
*  It's a person that's in a room and you're like, oh, a celebrity's here. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6491.92s)]
*  I could give that off. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6494.64s)]
*  Right. But it's like, think of her beauty. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6495.6s)]
*  And then that other lady that you said that did a bunch of shit to her face. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6497.92s)]
*  Probably same age, right? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6500.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6502.68s)]
*  And they're crazy. It is crazy. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6503.4400000000005s)]
*  They know it's awesome. That movie, by the way, a young [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6504.84s)]
*  only one song out Lizzo. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6508.200000000001s)]
*  And everyone was so excited for her. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6511.320000000001s)]
*  And I didn't know she was. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6513.4400000000005s)]
*  And they go, they were talking about the celebrities are going to be there today. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6514.56s)]
*  And she's playing a stripper. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6516.72s)]
*  And I was like, hmm, I'm wondering who it is. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6518.360000000001s)]
*  And then hours later, my next question was, I'm like, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6520.320000000001s)]
*  who's the big fat stripper wearing the fishnet outfit? [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6524.92s)]
*  And they're like, that's Lizzo. Yeah. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6529.200000000001s)]
*  Like, that's Lizzo. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6531.52s)]
*  I was like, Christ Almighty. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6532.320000000001s)]
*  Are they making her do that? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6534.320000000001s)]
*  And again, it's my own fed insecurity that I put out on other people. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6537.080000000001s)]
*  Almost like I said, that guy earlier who was like the robe open. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6540.320000000001s)]
*  There's got to be guys that want to see that. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6542.88s)]
*  I'm impressed because what I have is much more, which I always found interesting. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6544.52s)]
*  Chris Farley, you know, he's most this most famous thing ever [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6549.200000000001s)]
*  is the Chippendale sketch. Right. With Patrick Swayze. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6553.719999999999s)]
*  I've always thought and I just know this from I'm good friends with his brother [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6557.679999999999s)]
*  and from years of reading stuff about it, like that's [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6561.12s)]
*  if you want to trickle back what killed them, it's essentially that. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6564.44s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? It's like he hated. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6567.08s)]
*  He was willing to do it. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6569.04s)]
*  Like, I'll be the fat, gross guy. But he hated it. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6570.08s)]
*  He didn't want everyone to think he was like fat and gross. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6572.639999999999s)]
*  So that's like I have a hard time with like with those kind of things. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6574.48s)]
*  So I'm impressed also with someone who's like ladies, you know, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6577.44s)]
*  with like their fucking fat rolls on their sides. Welcome to the party. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6581.96s)]
*  Well, how do you do it? [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6586.0s)]
*  And Lizzo just like, fuck it, I'm wearing a thong. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6587.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, don't you don't have to. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6590.12s)]
*  It's one of those things where it's like you want to celebrate people [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6592.4400000000005s)]
*  that don't care. Like, yeah, you go. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6595.68s)]
*  But also, yikes. Yeah. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6598.0s)]
*  It's also yikes. It's always lies, too, by the way. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6600.36s)]
*  She's lost 100 pounds. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6602.6s)]
*  Well, also remember when she was accused of fat shaming all the girls [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6603.76s)]
*  that she worked with and making them making hookers. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6607.32s)]
*  Make any stripper pussy and shit. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6610.72s)]
*  Yeah, whatever, whatever was going down, whatever she was accused of. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6611.84s)]
*  I don't know if it's real. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6615.6s)]
*  But it's like the Chris Farley thing, I never would have imagined [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6616.52s)]
*  that he hated doing that. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6619.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No, he loved making people laugh, but he hated that it was at the expense. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6621.240000000001s)]
*  And I don't think I'm speaking at a school here that said that. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6625.120000000001s)]
*  But it never seemed like that stuff did bother him, I think he wanted. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6628.52s)]
*  He wanted girls to like him. He wanted to. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6631.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, so that's why he got big in the drugs. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6633.400000000001s)]
*  Are you basing this on conversations that you've had with people that know him? [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6636.4800000000005s)]
*  Conversations that I've watched so much stuff like on him. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6640.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And you could see, like, you know, they again, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6642.96s)]
*  it's people reading in this stuff and sure. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6645.16s)]
*  But yeah, but I think also from talking to his brother and stuff. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6646.4800000000005s)]
*  I met him once. I met him once when he was in the throes of it. Really? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6649.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a couple of people that I met where their skin looked like wet [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6654.2s)]
*  cardboard, like it was the consistency of wet, like gray cardboard, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6658.280000000001s)]
*  like sweaty gray cardboard. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6663.76s)]
*  So he was on the set hanging out. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6666.92s)]
*  There was always like a lot of fun people that were on the set that you got to meet. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6670.240000000001s)]
*  And he wasn't working on the show. He was just there to hang out. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6673.76s)]
*  And so I ran into him like during the craft service table area. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6677.92s)]
*  And he was just looked terrible. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6683.120000000001s)]
*  And I don't know, like, what year did he die? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6686.4400000000005s)]
*  I think late 90s also. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6690.120000000001s)]
*  So this was around 97 ish. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6693.240000000001s)]
*  Somewhere around then. So News Radio was 94 to 99. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6696.4s)]
*  December week before Christmas. That's when he died. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6700.679999999999s)]
*  33. So it might have been the year he died. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6703.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because he looked like hell. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6707.08s)]
*  He looked like he was just so sweaty and so gray. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6709.08s)]
*  He just looked fucked up. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6712.92s)]
*  The one other time there was a dude that I ran into at the improv [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6716.0s)]
*  and he couldn't form sentences. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6720.32s)]
*  He had like the same gray skin and he was talking to me, but nothing made sense. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6723.56s)]
*  But he just kept talking and he could he couldn't form sentences. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6728.400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6731.16s)]
*  It's also weird to get into that and then still be around comedy. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6734.64s)]
*  Just be around public. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6737.56s)]
*  You're hanging around with people at a bar and you you're so gacked up. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6738.76s)]
*  You can't even form a sentence. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6742.88s)]
*  I have a hard time with the I mean, I can. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6744.280000000001s)]
*  I can get caught up in like the the dramatic conversation of like the [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6746.84s)]
*  science of comedy and like the all the internal things and the manipulation of it. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6751.08s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it's so silly when like it's taken so seriously in some way, too. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6755.68s)]
*  It's like it's not like, you know, unlike Daniel Day-Lewis, who has to be Lincoln all day. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6760.88s)]
*  Someone can go, Jay, they're calling your name on stage and you can go up. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6765.68s)]
*  I don't have to like find my place. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6769.68s)]
*  You know, I mean, like, oh, I'm not even, you know, oh, hang on. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6771.8s)]
*  OK. You know, you just go on stage and be like, shit, I didn't know they were calling me. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6775.16s)]
*  Sorry, everybody. But also, you're doing sets multiple times a night. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6778.84s)]
*  You're doing multiple sets a week. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6782.12s)]
*  You're so comfortable being on stage. It's not like action. Right. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6784.2s)]
*  You know, you're Lincoln. Go. Yeah. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6787.92s)]
*  And every score and seven years ago, you mess up a line. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6790.68s)]
*  They got to go change the gate. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6794.52s)]
*  They got to do a bunch of fucking things. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6796.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And there's always someone who wants to come in and touch up your hair. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6797.92s)]
*  And then there's fucking people moving around. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6800.400000000001s)]
*  And there's always so many support people. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6802.24s)]
*  It's hard to just like keep your fucking concentration. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6804.400000000001s)]
*  Some people like being doted on Dan Soder. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6807.2s)]
*  I've always heard he likes acting and and not even just acting. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6809.52s)]
*  He likes the day he takes the day in the trailer and he said, he'll write jokes and, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6813.6s)]
*  you know, do whatever. And happy dude. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6819.08s)]
*  Dan Soder seems like he's always happy. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6821.04s)]
*  It's hard to imagine him being even angry. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6823.16s)]
*  Like he was talking to me about somebody who ripped off one of his jokes. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6825.68s)]
*  And even that, the way he's talking about the guy ripping off his joke [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6828.400000000001s)]
*  and confronting him about ripping off the joke, it's still easily. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6832.56s)]
*  Silly. Yeah. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6835.92s)]
*  He's being silly and laughing about it. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6837.160000000001s)]
*  I'm like, wow. Oh, he's the best. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6838.8s)]
*  For sure. Great demeanor. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6840.6s)]
*  So that's like a glass is always half full guy. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6842.320000000001s)]
*  He's he's fine with doing a little acting here. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6844.400000000001s)]
*  But if you know what he wants to do is stand up. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6846.64s)]
*  He's a great. No, no, he's great. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6848.6s)]
*  Step in. He does want to do step in. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6849.68s)]
*  He wants to make shows. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6850.88s)]
*  He's got a lot of interest that I think will be great at all. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6851.76s)]
*  I'm just saying more like, you know, I'm losing my train of thought. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6854.92s)]
*  You don't have to do all that other stuff. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6858.200000000001s)]
*  And the thing is, like back in the 90s, we all thought we had to do that other stuff. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6860.320000000001s)]
*  I would have never imagined like quitting a TV show. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6864.76s)]
*  And just so I could do stand up on the road. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6867.96s)]
*  First of all, you needed the TV show so people come to see you. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6869.76s)]
*  That was people. That was a big thing. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6872.76s)]
*  Back then, people came to see you if you were on The Tonight Show [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6874.92s)]
*  or if you had an HBO special or if you had a sitcom. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6878.72s)]
*  Like that was that's why I was so impressive person like [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6881.08s)]
*  like Regan. Yes. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6885.320000000001s)]
*  I was going to bring him up. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6886.68s)]
*  Yes. You did it straight through comedy. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6887.72s)]
*  Just organic and got the theaters. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6890.52s)]
*  Yep. Huge theaters. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6892.16s)]
*  Yeah. Sells out instantly just because he's so good. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6893.36s)]
*  You know, it's funny, the quietest, the people who are the most surprising. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6896.4s)]
*  There's huge earning comics that we've you've never even heard of and stuff. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6899.599999999999s)]
*  I always look about like Sean DePierce is a lady [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6904.96s)]
*  just like an old lady from the south, but she's multi-millionaire, sells out. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6909.0s)]
*  She performs at like churches and stuff. Really? [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6915.88s)]
*  Yeah. But it's just stand up. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6918.48s)]
*  And it's just like the most mundane. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6920.2s)]
*  But again, it's not for me, obviously. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6924.4s)]
*  But I mean, with this kind of whatever, you know, like act, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6926.36s)]
*  you know, wouldn't impress anybody. She's making millions. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6930.84s)]
*  Christian comedy is a tough sell. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6933.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Well, but there's a market for it. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6935.88s)]
*  There is a market for it. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6937.679999999999s)]
*  I remember there was a bunch of people that went into Christian comedy. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6938.679999999999s)]
*  There was like a Christian comedy tour back in like. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6941.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was terrible. It was terrible. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6945.5599999999995s)]
*  To want to go to that seems boring. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6947.72s)]
*  Even if you were religious, like, I don't want to go watch religious comedy. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6949.36s)]
*  But it was like the most aw shucks, stupid shit. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6952.08s)]
*  About like the guy's dumb and my wife always tells me I'm dumb and she's right. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6954.719999999999s)]
*  It's why Nate Barghetti is so impressive to me and always has been [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6959.16s)]
*  is because he's clean in that way. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6962.639999999999s)]
*  You can call him a Christian comic and it doesn't matter because [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6964.0s)]
*  if you just watch the comedy, if you're not listening [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6967.5599999999995s)]
*  to all the labels being put on them, right, you just brilliant. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6969.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's just great. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6971.799999999999s)]
*  And more than brilliant, hilarious, fucking hilarious, hilarious and squeaky clean. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6973.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you throw them on anywhere in a lineup. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6976.96s)]
*  Yeah. So Gary Goldman was so impressive in that way, too. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6980.08s)]
*  It just didn't have to be dirty, like almost like subjects. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6982.84s)]
*  You were someone who said the right joke by the subject. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6986.04s)]
*  You're like, no, that's corny. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6988.2s)]
*  Well, Gaffigan and then they do it and kill it. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6989.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6991.08s)]
*  Gaffigan's been killing it forever. Squeaky clean. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6991.68s)]
*  You know, there's you know, there's a market like again. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6994.6s)]
*  But everyone shouldn't be that right. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6997.2s)]
*  That's the Hannah Gatsby argument she made. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=6998.52s)]
*  That's the really whatever my opinions about our comedy are meaningless. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7001.56s)]
*  It was an article she did where she was like, if you're not using [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7005.32s)]
*  your comedy to like move society forward in some way, [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7008.2s)]
*  yeah, that's like you're wasting time, basically. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7011.5599999999995s)]
*  Like you like you need to come and talk about your rape [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7013.719999999999s)]
*  or you're wasting time doing comedy. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7016.24s)]
*  And it's like, or you're not being personal. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7017.5599999999995s)]
*  I go. So you're saying like David Tell, Brian Regan, Carrot Top, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7019.759999999999s)]
*  you think people just shouldn't be in comedy because they're a different [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7023.16s)]
*  like faction of it than you. That's insane. It's insane. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7026.679999999999s)]
*  And God forbid, if everybody started doing Hannah Gatsby style quality, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7029.36s)]
*  she's fucked. She's not going to be the best at it. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7033.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? Right. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7036.12s)]
*  It's like, why are you welcome? [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7037.28s)]
*  It's like, why don't you stay, keep your lane and be happy? [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7038.0s)]
*  Here's the other thing about comedy. Like. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7040.12s)]
*  You should be funny first. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7043.24s)]
*  If you want to do all that other stuff, too. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7046.0s)]
*  But if you want to do all that other stuff and you call it comedy, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7047.8s)]
*  but it's not funny, like you're doing something [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7050.84s)]
*  where you're just trying to educate people. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7053.599999999999s)]
*  Hey, that you missed the whole mark of this whole thing. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7056.24s)]
*  And to say that that's the most important thing. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7059.48s)]
*  The only people that would say that are people who aren't funny. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7061.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7064.679999999999s)]
*  That's the only people that would ever think that the most important thing [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7065.5199999999995s)]
*  is to move social justice forward. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7067.96s)]
*  It's your comedy. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7069.5199999999995s)]
*  If somebody told me I made them think on stage, I go about what? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7070.4s)]
*  About what? Listen, you could be as social justice as you want. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7073.759999999999s)]
*  You could talk to your phone. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7077.2s)]
*  You can make long rants on reels. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7078.639999999999s)]
*  You could do podcasts. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7080.599999999999s)]
*  You could do whatever you want. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7081.799999999999s)]
*  Talk about issues. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7082.96s)]
*  But when you're on stage, what you're supposed to be doing is be funny. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7084.2s)]
*  Now, if you can be funny with some sort of grand message [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7087.92s)]
*  that makes everybody Bill Hicks clap at you, that's great. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7090.44s)]
*  But that's not the goal. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7093.599999999999s)]
*  The goal is to just be funny. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7095.4s)]
*  And if that's your goal, you want to be funny with a social justice. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7096.96s)]
*  Great. Nothing wrong with it. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7100.719999999999s)]
*  But you got to be funny. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7102.799999999999s)]
*  And you can't like fake it and get clapped or and think you're. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7104.36s)]
*  Anything I would even say with passion on stage, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7108.28s)]
*  I could end just as easily by going or not, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7110.4s)]
*  or maybe I'm completely wrong. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7113.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know. Definitely. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7115.0s)]
*  How the fuck would I know? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7116.599999999999s)]
*  Remember, guys would do this when they were bombing. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7117.48s)]
*  Hey, how about a nice round of applause for the ladies? [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7119.72s)]
*  Give a round of applause for all the ladies in the crowd. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7121.84s)]
*  They go, how many? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7123.72s)]
*  At the in the black comedy circuit, it was a those are the funniest. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7125.16s)]
*  How many they would give it goes, how about for ladies? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7128.320000000001s)]
*  How about for a brother doing the right thing? [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7130.240000000001s)]
*  Staying out of jail, doing the right thing, trying to do the right thing? [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7131.64s)]
*  Yeah, they get claps. Yes, yes. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7133.64s)]
*  And then it was positive energy. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7135.92s)]
*  But we all we all your way. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7138.16s)]
*  But we all use some crushing that I went, I think. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7139.320000000001s)]
*  So not just because I was, you know, obviously inspired by the dices [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7141.6s)]
*  and stuff for the comics that I like the dirtier guys. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7145.4800000000005s)]
*  But I would go dirty because I found out pretty early if you go dirty, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7148.0s)]
*  even if you don't get the laugh, because the joke wasn't good, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7150.76s)]
*  you're going to get the groan. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7152.72s)]
*  And it was a noise. Yeah. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7153.84s)]
*  Because that was it to me. Again, I said the silence was the thing. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7155.280000000001s)]
*  Once it was silent, I was like, someone, please save me from this. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7157.56s)]
*  It's going so bad. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7161.72s)]
*  Yeah. If you get a few. Oh, God. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7163.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. At least you're like, either with me. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7165.76s)]
*  You can kind of you can kind of laugh that off yourself. Yeah. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7167.160000000001s)]
*  And then if you're laughing genuinely, maybe people start smiling. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7169.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's a fucking weird art form, dude. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7174.400000000001s)]
*  But, you know, kudos to you for just doing that, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7176.96s)]
*  because that's the way to do it. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7181.36s)]
*  And then Legion of Skanks, too. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7182.4800000000005s)]
*  Like what Lewis and you guys and Dave, what you guys have done [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7184.04s)]
*  is so interesting because you did it all without ever worrying about being [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7187.08s)]
*  like removed from YouTube, you know, because you did it all on his network. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7191.08s)]
*  Sure. Gas Digital. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7195.24s)]
*  I mean, you started Gas Digital essentially for Legion of Skanks, more or less. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7196.4s)]
*  So smart. And it would have like a plan that they really can't get rid of. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7199.88s)]
*  Yeah, because it limits your reach a little bit. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7202.92s)]
*  But over time, people figure it out. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7206.08s)]
*  That's why Skank Fest is so fucking huge. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7208.4400000000005s)]
*  Skank Fest is nuts, dude. It's fun. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7210.92s)]
*  It's been great doing New Orleans this year. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7213.76s)]
*  I should have got in when I could have done it. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7215.68s)]
*  Now it seems like I don't. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7218.160000000001s)]
*  I just I know there's too many people. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7219.200000000001s)]
*  I'll get anxiety. There's a lot of people for sure. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7221.64s)]
*  But it's amazing how like you have a blast. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7224.4400000000005s)]
*  It's such a celebration of people just being stupid and having fun. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7226.6s)]
*  Absolutely. And there's no like, you know, pretense. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7230.76s)]
*  No. And I said they all look the part, but they're such great comedy fans. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7233.719999999999s)]
*  And by the way, also, I mean that in the sense that there's been so many people [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7236.8s)]
*  who have been like Skank Fest is my thing. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7241.2s)]
*  I'm like, dude, they're going to fucking lose their minds for you. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7243.2s)]
*  Yeah, you don't even know. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7245.84s)]
*  It's like they're comedy fans. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7246.599999999999s)]
*  They're not just like our fans. Right. Exclusive. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7247.5599999999995s)]
*  They're also fans of people that are willing to do real comedy in this [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7249.84s)]
*  fucking bizarre world where you're being told that the most important thing [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7253.92s)]
*  is for you to do social justice on stage, which I shouldn't say. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7258.36s)]
*  That's the world now, because that it's not. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7260.96s)]
*  It was the world like four years ago. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7263.04s)]
*  Four years ago, you heard that a lot. Oh, yeah. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7264.92s)]
*  And that's kind of died off. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7266.96s)]
*  And there was a bunch of things that killed that. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7268.44s)]
*  But I think the real nail in the coffin, the final one was the Tom Brady roast. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7270.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think that was the grand nail in the coffin of woke comedy. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7273.88s)]
*  Well, all you had to show people was that there was like, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7278.6s)]
*  if you stick with something for a minute, like there is an audience there. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7280.8s)]
*  You're just listening to a bunch of lunatics screaming [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7284.44s)]
*  with nothing to do with their lives. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7287.16s)]
*  It's like, but if you give it a second, like [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7288.84s)]
*  conversely, of much people are writing, they're angry about this. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7291.2s)]
*  There's a bazillion people who just like it. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7294.04s)]
*  Yeah, you can't cater to the people that are upset at what popular [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7295.599999999999s)]
*  thing there is out there. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7301.24s)]
*  Can you imagine writing a letter to ACDC like this last record sucked? [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7302.639999999999s)]
*  First, second song is OK, but third song blows. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7306.88s)]
*  And the fourth one is like, that's the fuck you. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7310.0s)]
*  You're not funny person in the crowd. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7311.96s)]
*  There's always going to be a percentage of them. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7313.44s)]
*  There's it's an unavoidable aspect of human nature. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7315.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a bunch of people that don't do anything, can't contribute [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7318.12s)]
*  and want to knock down everything they see in front of them. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7320.84s)]
*  There's a bunch of people that were born with amazing genetics [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7323.28s)]
*  that just have this superiority over everybody that they believe is real. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7325.76s)]
*  And they, you know, especially if you're pretty and everybody wants to fuck you [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7329.28s)]
*  and you think you could yell at anything at the guy on stage. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7332.08s)]
*  Maybe you hate men because your ex boyfriend's a piece of shit [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7335.0s)]
*  and you've had a couple of cocktails and fuck him and fuck this guy. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7337.56s)]
*  Don't fucking say women can't do it. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7340.52s)]
*  And can take the day. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7342.32s)]
*  I think it's going to break down. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7344.56s)]
*  It's the funniest. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7346.72s)]
*  So I think you're going to break down your bit. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7347.56s)]
*  Well, that's the best. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7350.320000000001s)]
*  I had a lady heckle me once where I was trying to explain. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7351.320000000001s)]
*  I was doing this bit about I had a bit about the guy who broke into the White House [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7354.280000000001s)]
*  because this guy, some fucking maniac broke into the White House. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7358.280000000001s)]
*  He just hopped the fence, ran across the lawn and broke in. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7362.320000000001s)]
*  And there was a lady guarding the front door. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7364.92s)]
*  And he smacked her to the ground, just ran through [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7367.280000000001s)]
*  and he got tackled by an off duty Secret Service guy. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7369.68s)]
*  It was like getting a cup of coffee and sees this fucking guy [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7372.040000000001s)]
*  running through the White House and he tackles him. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7374.080000000001s)]
*  And the joke was about a woman being a security guard at the White House. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7376.68s)]
*  And the joke was supposed to be, I know, because guess what? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7380.68s)]
*  I shouldn't be a security guard at the White House. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7385.96s)]
*  I go and you know how I know, because I met Shaquille O'Neal [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7388.36s)]
*  and his dick is where my face is. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7390.5199999999995s)]
*  It was like if the White House is spearing seeing his shack attack, [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7392.24s)]
*  I'm the wrong dude to save the world. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7394.96s)]
*  You know, shit. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7396.639999999999s)]
*  So the whole joke was about that. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7397.84s)]
*  And I couldn't get it out because this lady's like bullshit, bullshit. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7399.36s)]
*  So the joke was women can't do everything men can do [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7403.679999999999s)]
*  because men can't do everything men can do. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7406.48s)]
*  That's why we have the Olympics. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7408.4s)]
*  There's some people that can just do shit that regular people can't do. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7410.24s)]
*  And one of those things is guarding the fucking White House. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7413.16s)]
*  Like you should be a big fucking giant dude who's capable of extreme violence. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7416.84s)]
*  But this bitch wouldn't let me get this out. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7420.92s)]
*  She's like, and I try to explain her this is how the joke goes. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7422.599999999999s)]
*  And then I went further into the joke and she chimed in again. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7425.679999999999s)]
*  I explained the joke and then she was like, OK, I'm like, yeah, I'm saying I can't do it. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7428.48s)]
*  I've gone hard at female cops so much. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7433.6s)]
*  It's so great when I meet female cops. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7436.2s)]
*  They're like they usually have a great sense of humor is about it, quite honestly. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7437.6s)]
*  But I will film and send to like soldiers who all do it to. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7440.8s)]
*  I watch cops still a lot like clips of the show Cops. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7444.84s)]
*  And there was one I watched recently that was just about the female cop. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7448.8s)]
*  Whenever it's a female cop, I'm like, I get my phone ready in case I have to film this. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7452.44s)]
*  Because it's always going to be something hilarious. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7456.04s)]
*  And they're always in the way somehow or something. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7458.64s)]
*  And it's they're trying to stop this guy, you know, he's on foot, black dude. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7461.28s)]
*  And this lady is like, let me see your ID. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7465.04s)]
*  Let me see your ID right now. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7467.16s)]
*  And the guy is slowly backing away and they just decides to go start running. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7468.5599999999995s)]
*  And he runs and this girl is chasing this black guy is so far away from her. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7472.719999999999s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7477.12s)]
*  And then just coming zipping right past her is a dude cop who just catches the guy [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7478.08s)]
*  and tackles him. And then it's the rest of the time that her standing over breathing hard. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7482.88s)]
*  She's like, son of a bitch, got away. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7485.8s)]
*  And it's like, lady, what are you doing? [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7488.679999999999s)]
*  I saw one time I was waiting outside of a doctor's office in New York [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7491.5599999999995s)]
*  and I saw a guy who was naked with his hospital gown on the floor next to him. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7496.36s)]
*  This isn't outside of a hospital, by the way, just a doctor's office. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7503.12s)]
*  This guy left the hospital clear. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7505.4s)]
*  He's naked. Still has his bracelet on. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7506.8s)]
*  He's flapping his dick around. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7509.36s)]
*  So I call the cops and I go, hey, I think there's a guy who got out of a hospital here. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7511.04s)]
*  He's naked and he seems pretty unruly. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7515.24s)]
*  He's like screaming shit. He's being kind of weird. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7517.8s)]
*  They go, will you stay on the phone with us and let me know when the officers get there? [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7519.72s)]
*  I go, sure. And then a big NYPD van pulls up and two tiny little ladies get out. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7523.400000000001s)]
*  And I started laughing on the phone and I'm like, yo, I don't think these these ones [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7529.92s)]
*  are going to be able to handle you. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7534.52s)]
*  Moment of sense, somebody else. And they go, why? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7535.320000000001s)]
*  Go, because it's like two tiny ladies, miss. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7536.88s)]
*  And I'm like, and this guy's like, I'm going to have to get involved now. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7539.56s)]
*  And I don't want to. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7543.240000000001s)]
*  And then the guy stood up and he's walking towards them. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7544.52s)]
*  And the ladies are like, first of all, already touching their guns, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7546.76s)]
*  which is like, again, not really necessarily the guy's naked. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7549.28s)]
*  He doesn't have a weapon, but they're so tiny. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7552.76s)]
*  Like, how many options do they have? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7554.72s)]
*  Well, they have to if he goes at them. Right. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7556.4s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7558.08s)]
*  If you're if you're a small woman and a naked guy is coming your way [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7558.72s)]
*  and you don't know how to fight and you have a gun, you're grabbing your gun. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7562.16s)]
*  And the guy just went up to them and just stood about [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7565.24s)]
*  seven feet in front of them and started pissing at their feet. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7568.5199999999995s)]
*  And then and then finally, another cop car came with a guy who just, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7571.24s)]
*  I mean, got out of the car right away, grabbed him by the arms. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7574.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, I mean, put his arms behind his back [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7577.08s)]
*  and they put the this thing back over him, his gown back on him. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7578.88s)]
*  But it was just like I had a pee. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7582.04s)]
*  What's the problem? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7583.32s)]
*  He didn't couldn't find his clothes. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7584.28s)]
*  But it's just so wild. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7585.56s)]
*  I'm like, why are these two a team at all? [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7586.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I would like to say that women could do everything men can do. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7591.12s)]
*  But I think in that circumstance, you probably want a big man. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7595.400000000001s)]
*  Feel big. Police work. That's crazy. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7599.72s)]
*  You're dealing with one of the scariest videos that I ever saw was this guy. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7601.92s)]
*  This lady pulled him over on the highway and the guy gets out [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7606.0s)]
*  and he's beating the fuck out of this lady cop and his daughter. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7609.120000000001s)]
*  The guys who's beating the cop, his daughter is saying, Daddy, stop. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7614.400000000001s)]
*  Daddy, stop, because he's just beating the shit out of this unconscious lady. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7620.160000000001s)]
*  It's so scary. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7624.76s)]
*  It's so scary because this there's no way she should have been in that situation. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7626.92s)]
*  There's no way a chubby female cop to boot is the funniest. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7630.64s)]
*  You're like, what is happening all the time? [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7634.04s)]
*  What is the problem going to solve all the time? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7636.28s)]
*  But they're in the way. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7638.08s)]
*  Like I was at a casino once and this person who I thought. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7639.88s)]
*  Air quotes was a woman and I was talking to it was a security guard, [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7646.68s)]
*  like five foot five, like shorter than me, a security guard woman. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7650.84s)]
*  I thought that was a woman. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7656.04s)]
*  It wasn't disturbed by the fact that she was a security guard. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7657.76s)]
*  None of it. Right. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7661.04s)]
*  But then at the end of the night, I had been talking to these people. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7662.64s)]
*  You know, the show was over and I was like, well, ladies, it was really nice to meet you. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7666.6s)]
*  And she says, actually, I'm a man. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7670.6s)]
*  And she says it like with a woman's voice. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7673.4400000000005s)]
*  And I said, and I'm like, stuck. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7675.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, I probably had a couple of cocktails, just did a show. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7678.76s)]
*  And I'm probably going to go, are you for sure? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7681.88s)]
*  Like, what? [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7686.88s)]
*  So I said, I'm sorry. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7688.280000000001s)]
*  I didn't mean anything by it. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7689.8s)]
*  I didn't know. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7690.96s)]
*  I gave her a hug, hugged everybody and I felt proud of myself that I didn't say something. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7692.28s)]
*  She had not checked her. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7696.84s)]
*  I was just like, you know, not check. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7697.92s)]
*  It's just like you definitely you're not. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7699.72s)]
*  But, you know, whatever. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7702.0s)]
*  Like to think that I should have known, like, that's crazy. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7703.44s)]
*  And I had something you identify as a man. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7707.16s)]
*  I had something turn on me so bad with that. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7709.64s)]
*  Not even a mustache. I had a diner. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7711.92s)]
*  It was me, Josh, Adam Myers and my girlfriend [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7716.24s)]
*  went to a concert and went to a diner afterwards and where they set us this diner. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7719.72s)]
*  Our table was facing the booths that are going across [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7723.400000000001s)]
*  and the booth right across from staring is a cute girl. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7727.8s)]
*  And what I thought was a goth guy. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7732.68s)]
*  I thought it was like a goth dude is wearing like kind of fishnet stuff and everything. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7736.0s)]
*  And they are making out hard up, like going. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7740.360000000001s)]
*  They're going for it. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7744.16s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, we're kind of like laughing it off almost [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7745.4400000000005s)]
*  at first, you know, like, all right, I guess like the girl. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7749.44s)]
*  But then it starts getting like there, like like she's like getting in a position. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7752.28s)]
*  The girl, the only girl I thought is when like the goth guys, [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7756.16s)]
*  he's rubbing like a pussy over the pants and she's like riding around. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7761.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's going on. Then they stop in a diner. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7765.4s)]
*  Yeah. Then they stop. Then they start again. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7768.0s)]
*  It's a point where I go laughingly, though, too. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7771.08s)]
*  I kind of go, oh, come on. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7773.04s)]
*  And they're like and they're like, they have like an oh, my God, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7775.44s)]
*  what the fuck is wrong with you thing? [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7777.36s)]
*  Now, there's people they're in a booth and we're the only people who see them. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7779.32s)]
*  We're facing them. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7782.92s)]
*  These booths are other people, but they're just not paying attention. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7784.16s)]
*  What's going on there? I'm just having to look at it. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7788.24s)]
*  And I'm like, all right. And they're like, what's the problem? [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7789.5599999999995s)]
*  And I'm still just kind of laughingly going like, I get it. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7792.24s)]
*  But like, you know, I'm doing like a guy. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7794.4s)]
*  I'm like, you're fucking at the table. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7796.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, like, it's crazy. We're in a diner. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7798.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's getting shitty about it. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7800.88s)]
*  And then I'm just like, I don't know what the problem is. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7803.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's crazy what you're doing and everything. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7805.4s)]
*  And I'm like, we're not wrong here. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7807.48s)]
*  And then she was and then she goes, would you have a problem [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7809.5199999999995s)]
*  if we were a straight couple? [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7811.919999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I thought that was I thought that was a guy. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7813.48s)]
*  I said, I didn't know it wasn't a straight couple. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7817.5199999999995s)]
*  And then whatever, it all kind of calms down. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7820.0s)]
*  And then our food's coming, which is weird. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7822.759999999999s)]
*  We still have to sit there. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7825.36s)]
*  And I go, yeah, I'm going to go outside and smoke a cigarette [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7825.919999999999s)]
*  and like regroup here a little bit. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7827.599999999999s)]
*  Biggest mistake I ever made because I went outside [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7828.959999999999s)]
*  and I'm just like a big glass front restaurant, a diner. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7832.12s)]
*  And I'm smoking right outside the diner. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7836.48s)]
*  And I'm watching the narrative get created in the room [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7837.88s)]
*  without me being in the room. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7840.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the people behind and the staff coming up and being like, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7841.84s)]
*  we're sorry, things people have to still act like. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7845.5199999999995s)]
*  People still act like that today. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7849.36s)]
*  And when I go back in the eat, I mean, we are. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7851.96s)]
*  Pariah, I just feel like. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7855.28s)]
*  And then the host guy [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7856.84s)]
*  who like, you know, seats everybody is gay and he's side. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7860.12s)]
*  It just it was so uncomfortable. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7862.88s)]
*  And I was like, I explain yourself. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7864.64s)]
*  We didn't do anything. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7866.04s)]
*  No, there's nothing to explain. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7867.080000000001s)]
*  It was kind of awkward to give us our food. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7868.280000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, you guys are mad. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7869.88s)]
*  Somehow me, I'm a spit. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7871.400000000001s)]
*  Do you think you ate so much so much spit with shitty food? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7872.56s)]
*  Then I told that story on my radio show. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7876.96s)]
*  It was funny. And somebody like message like the Yelp or whatever the thing. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7878.76s)]
*  And they were like, that guy was being transphobic. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7882.88s)]
*  And we this is a welcoming restaurant who allows anybody in. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7886.72s)]
*  It's like, how is this the narrative of what happened? [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7889.68s)]
*  They got there. They got me. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7892.4800000000005s)]
*  They got you completely created around me. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7893.88s)]
*  I wouldn't have cared if it was trans. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7895.92s)]
*  I thought it was a straight couple fucking in a diner booth that I wanted to stop. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7897.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, people are good at spinning a tale. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7901.16s)]
*  If and by the way, I said it's always the in-betweens to in full disclosure. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7903.4400000000005s)]
*  If the guy like had her, what I thought was the guy [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7907.8s)]
*  had that girl's like shorts to the side and I was watching him finger. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7911.72s)]
*  I wouldn't have said a word. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7915.04s)]
*  I would just sit there and just drank it all in. Interesting. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7916.28s)]
*  It was just it wasn't going hard enough. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7918.32s)]
*  It wasn't soft enough or hard enough. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7920.52s)]
*  It was Goldilocks right in the middle. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7923.12s)]
*  And I don't want to see I don't want to see you guys dry hump while I'm eating [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7925.08s)]
*  either finger where we could all see or fucking take it down the road. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7928.32s)]
*  That's hilarious that they put that put transphobia on. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7932.36s)]
*  I mean, thought it was a guy. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7935.32s)]
*  The whole diner when we went back in was like these intolerant people go, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7936.64s)]
*  I don't care if that's a girl. It means nothing to me. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7939.92s)]
*  They didn't see it. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7943.12s)]
*  Also, maybe if they announced it was a girl out of the gates, I might not say anything either. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7944.32s)]
*  Just two chicks going out of the thing. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7950.4800000000005s)]
*  Look at these two wild motherfuckers. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7952.0s)]
*  Right. You just thought it was crazy that it was a dude doing that. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7953.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's funny. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7955.68s)]
*  You know, funny. That's weird. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7957.68s)]
*  It's weird how we look at that. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7960.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. But I said you get wrapped up in a thing and you're like, you're transphobia. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7961.6s)]
*  That has nothing to do with any of those. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7964.92s)]
*  It's a problem because that label, you just slap on someone when you're talking about like [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7966.2s)]
*  male athletes that identify as women competing in girl sports. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7972.0s)]
*  Like that's not transphobic. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7975.56s)]
*  That's just we're talking about something crazy. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7977.12s)]
*  Can I be trans weirdic? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7978.92s)]
*  Is that a term? Just be like, it's like, I think that's weird that that there's a six foot seven [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7980.32s)]
*  woman beating up an actual woman in a ring. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7986.719999999999s)]
*  There was some lady who was just arguing that there's no biological difference between men and women. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7988.88s)]
*  I'm going to send you this, Jamie, because it's so kooky. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7995.88s)]
*  You're like, come on. You can't really think that this is true. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=7998.639999999999s)]
*  This is no biological difference. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8002.5599999999995s)]
*  There's no difference between men and women strength. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8004.96s)]
*  Pennsylvania state senator said there's no biological advantage for men in women's sports or disadvantage for women in men's sports. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8007.799999999999s)]
*  That's a woman. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8018.44s)]
*  A woman said this. This is so crazy. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8019.599999999999s)]
*  I just sent it to you, Jamie. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8021.679999999999s)]
*  It's so kooky. You're like, come on. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8022.88s)]
*  Look, I know you want to believe this, but if you're going to be on TV saying things, it has to make some kind of fucking sense. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8024.88s)]
*  Female bodies are just as strong as fast and capable as male bodies. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8031.88s)]
*  I want all girls to know that there are elected officials like me who would never underestimate your ability to be a boy at their own sport, [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8038.12s)]
*  because that's what the premise of this bill assumes, that female bodies are less than male bodies. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8048.72s)]
*  For what reason, other than political gain, are we spending time and taxpayer dollars on a completely made up issue? [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8054.92s)]
*  Female bodies are just as strong. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8065.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8067.2s)]
*  What God heard her. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8068.08s)]
*  Well, she just got caught up in the woke bullshit. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8069.240000000001s)]
*  She lives in an echo chamber, probably all the people around her are all either in academia or in some sort of left wing fucking ideology. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8072.92s)]
*  And they really believe that. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8081.16s)]
*  And they believe that you should say that because if you're saying if you're not saying that, you're saying women are less than men. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8082.5199999999995s)]
*  That's not what anybody's saying. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8088.5599999999995s)]
*  Strength and speed and athleticism is not all of life. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8089.719999999999s)]
*  Well, you make the point. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8093.36s)]
*  There's men that are less than men in different areas. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8094.12s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8096.36s)]
*  They're called coders. They're out there. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8097.4s)]
*  Like, you know, they're incels. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8099.08s)]
*  They're online. They're they're making apps. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8100.36s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of different roles for people in this. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8102.44s)]
*  Like, it doesn't make you a man just because you're you can run faster than everybody else. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8104.5599999999995s)]
*  But to say that men can't run faster than women is just you're denying statistics and science and all the information that we have gathered forever. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8108.84s)]
*  We have so much data. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8116.400000000001s)]
*  High school 15 year old boys beat the women's soccer team, the professional team. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8118.4400000000005s)]
*  So shut the fuck up. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8126.04s)]
*  This is stupid to say. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8127.16s)]
*  This is stupid to say. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8128.76s)]
*  It's not transphobic, homophobic. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8130.360000000001s)]
*  It's not gender phobic. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8133.84s)]
*  It's not misogynistic. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8135.56s)]
*  It's just a fact of physical nature. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8137.12s)]
*  Also, if you if you hit the pinnacle, the fights over, do you know, I mean, if you go like women's sports is highly attended, it's given the same amount of TV time as men's sport. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8138.96s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, not enough. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8147.68s)]
*  Not really. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8149.36s)]
*  Like, now I want to now I want to be in men's sports. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8150.04s)]
*  Well, that's the craziest one when the NBA players want as much money as the NBA players. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8152.5599999999995s)]
*  So the NBA actually generates extreme amounts of revenue. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8157.44s)]
*  If the W somebody wrote a joke about it, the WNBA wanted what their just pay was. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8160.88s)]
*  And so they owe 400 million dollars because that's really what how it balances out. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8167.0s)]
*  It's like a losing. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8172.28s)]
*  It's never been profitable. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8173.08s)]
*  Do you know what those with those things? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8174.32s)]
*  But like again, like it's like you're helping the one to hurt the many in so many things, too. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8176.719999999999s)]
*  It's just like the video Shane showed me this years ago. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8182.44s)]
*  The blind kid playing football. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8185.679999999999s)]
*  Take a little boy playing popcorn or football and he's blind. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8187.839999999999s)]
*  And I'm like. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8190.759999999999s)]
*  Who is this for? [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8192.64s)]
*  Like, you know, it's like your dad. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8193.48s)]
*  It's like, why is he letting you do who is this for a daredevil? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8195.16s)]
*  And the kid gives a speech in the video. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8197.64s)]
*  It gives a speech and he goes, he goes, a lot of people say blind people can't play football. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8200.4s)]
*  You're like, yeah, everybody. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8205.24s)]
*  And you've never seen this video. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8208.32s)]
*  No, this is maybe my favorite video on the Internet. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8209.24s)]
*  You're blind football, Jamie, if you could. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8211.279999999999s)]
*  This is it's 30 second video. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8214.199999999999s)]
*  The song they pick for this is the is the greatest thing in the world. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8216.160000000002s)]
*  So here's the thing about like the WNBA. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8223.640000000001s)]
*  If you love the WNBA, that's great. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8225.880000000001s)]
*  There's a certain amount of people that love the WNBA. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8227.68s)]
*  It's great that women have an avenue for professional sports, but you only get paid as much [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8229.68s)]
*  as people are willing to go to see you. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8235.480000000001s)]
*  And if they're not willing to go see you, I'm sorry, because they want to see dunks. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8237.84s)]
*  This kid's blind. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8240.720000000001s)]
*  It's that kind of confidence that continues to amaze people who watch Dylan play. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8242.32s)]
*  Oh, this is so crazy. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8247.36s)]
*  Oh, this is so crazy. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8250.08s)]
*  But this courageous youngster has proven those people wrong. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8257.12s)]
*  You can't play football by smell. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8269.28s)]
*  It's impossible. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8271.2s)]
*  But it's against like what you're actually doing is making this game not fun for anybody [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8272.640000000001s)]
*  else out there. Right. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8276.68s)]
*  You can't hit the blind kid. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8277.800000000001s)]
*  No one's going to hit the blanket. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8279.28s)]
*  And if you do, you're a dick. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8280.320000000002s)]
*  He just running around. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8281.44s)]
*  So you have one less player for real. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8282.320000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's just like your team has decided to be on a handicap so you can get on [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8284.240000000002s)]
*  the news. We used to play basketball on a story every Wednesday. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8288.0s)]
*  And Nate Bargatze one time brought his friend Nick Novicki, who's a little person, comedian. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8291.76s)]
*  And he brought him and we were like, oh, he's going to play like, all right, I guess. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8297.28s)]
*  And we let him play. And every time you get the ball, the defense would lay off him and [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8302.52s)]
*  let him shoot and he'd make it or miss it. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8307.08s)]
*  But it was what it was. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8309.16s)]
*  And then he started when everyone would lay off on defense instead of shooting the ball, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8310.24s)]
*  he tried to run in, like do a layup and we're letting him. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8314.92s)]
*  So eventually, Nate Bargatze of all people goes over and just cleaned his shot right [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8318.4s)]
*  into the projects. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8322.24s)]
*  He just sent away, he's like, I can't just we can't just let this happen the whole time. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8324.039999999999s)]
*  Because it's not fun for everybody. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8329.16s)]
*  It was a there was when I was a kid, I remember very few stories, but there was a handful [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8330.68s)]
*  of like the girl that fought to get on the men's football team. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8335.64s)]
*  Yeah, football is such a violent sport that to let girls play it, they have to put them in [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8339.279999999999s)]
*  lingerie. The lingerie football league is the only is the only visible women playing [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8343.039999999999s)]

*  There's also Buns in basketball where they have morbidly obese black chicks wear thongs [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8357.64s)]
*  and play basketball. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8362.24s)]

*  It's like not fully real. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8379.279999999999s)]

*  Maybe they found it. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8412.96s)]
*  Maybe women's tackle football is what's up because you're going to see a lot of tackles. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8413.92s)]

*  These ladies. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8459.08s)]

*  You're going to get staph for sure. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8463.24s)]
*  Well, I will say the fact you get 22 girls [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8465.36s)]
*  on a field who are not fighting the idea of like, [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8468.72s)]
*  oh, so we just got to dress like sluts to play football. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8472.76s)]

*  Why are they shamed? [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8478.68s)]
*  And Buns and Bats, if you find Buns and Basketball, [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8480.52s)]
*  we should buy a franchise, dude. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8482.64s)]
*  Uncle Hazy's with you. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8484.36s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8485.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8487.92s)]
*  There's a couple of BBLs. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8488.92s)]
*  Actually, see if you could find the Buns and Basketball leg break. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8490.119999999999s)]
*  There's a girl who fucking, she's a Paul George like fucking leg break [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8493.0s)]
*  because she's just fat and she falls under the weight of her dribbling. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8497.24s)]
*  How bad is it? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8501.24s)]
*  It looks it's pretty gnarly. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8502.92s)]
*  It's not the worst I've ever seen. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8504.24s)]
*  It's not Tom Steger, his arm bad, but it's close. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8506.32s)]
*  That was bad. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8508.8s)]
*  I was so bad. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8509.36s)]
*  It's because when he pulls it back and it's flopped, it's the [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8510.52s)]
*  it's the Anderson Silver retracting the flopped leg. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8513.12s)]
*  You know, his arm still is fucked. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8516.08s)]
*  It's still not 100 percent. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8518.64s)]
*  Oh, I'd have to assume. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8520.44s)]
*  It's still fucked up. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8521.4s)]
*  He had a bunch of nerve surgeries and shit. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8522.64s)]
*  Yeah, that was gnarly. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8524.8s)]
*  Dude, imagine if it just imagine if anyone's playing defense. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8525.72s)]
*  Going for a layup. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8530.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, here we go. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8532.64s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8533.76s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8535.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8537.679999999998s)]
*  It just snaps for buns and basketball, of all things. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8540.72s)]
*  Oh, it just snapped. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8545.439999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8547.119999999999s)]
*  Hey, I can tell it's going to rain tomorrow. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8548.56s)]
*  How do you know that old buns and basketball injury? [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8550.359999999999s)]
*  Bro, those are bad injuries. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8554.0s)]
*  The femur is a real bad one because you got to get blood flow to it. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8555.64s)]
*  Sometimes it takes a long time. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8559.28s)]
*  Sometimes it doesn't fully heal. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8560.64s)]
*  Yeah. I know a couple of you a little broken femurs. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8562.2s)]
*  That's the most painful one. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8566.12s)]
*  Yeah, I know a dude, Frank Meir. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8567.12s)]
*  He was UFC champion. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8568.92s)]
*  He got hit by a car when he was on his motorcycle and he got thrown through the air. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8570.68s)]
*  And he was a giant fucking dude. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8575.4s)]
*  He came back to took a long time for he was like really back back. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8577.32s)]
*  You know, like it took well over a year and a half, two years before he was really performing at the same level. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8581.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, you'd have to ask him. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8587.04s)]
*  Then he came out and fought Brock, right? He was like the right away. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8588.44s)]
*  He fought Brock. He kneebarred him. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8590.52s)]
*  Yeah, that was all after the accident. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8592.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8594.720000000001s)]
*  Man, UFC really has straightened out your belief in other people from other sports, saying like, I can come to you, mix martial arts. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8595.800000000001s)]
*  Very few could ever pull it off. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8603.36s)]
*  But Brock pulled it off. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8604.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, the funniest one for me was again, just that blind belief I had in Kimbo Slice. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8606.240000000002s)]
*  I don't know why I didn't think that Roy Nelson would just hold him on the ground and mush his face until a referee was like, hey, leave him alone. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8613.76s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8620.36s)]
*  Well, Kimbo, he's a tough motherfucker, obviously. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8621.720000000001s)]
*  I mean, he was fighting just stand up only. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8623.880000000001s)]
*  He's very dangerous. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8625.84s)]
*  Like he was involved in like if bare knuckle boxing was around back then, he would have been a huge star of bare knuckle. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8626.92s)]
*  He would have fucked a lot of people up bare knuckle boxing. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8633.28s)]
*  But once you add in the wrestling and Kimbo had a bunch of knee injuries from football and, you know, it's you can't really grapple at full capacity with knee injuries and learn grappling at 35 or however old he was. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8636.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8650.04s)]
*  But, dude, kudos to that guy for having the courage to actually just get into the UFC ultimate fighter. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8650.68s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8657.320000000002s)]
*  With very little grappling against Roy Nelson was a Jiu Jitsu black belt, Hanzo Gracie black belt. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8658.12s)]
*  Roy Nelson's fucking legit on the ground. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8663.72s)]
*  He was great. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8665.96s)]
*  Big country. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8666.88s)]
*  He was so fun. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8667.6s)]
*  He was so heavy too. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8668.36s)]
*  Big old belly. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8669.24s)]
*  He knows how to hold people down. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8670.48s)]
*  And he was like, he would shut up Burger King. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8671.64s)]
*  He'd go to Burger King after the fights and stuff. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8672.96s)]
*  He also could fucking punch, dude. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8675.119999999999s)]
*  That guy could punch. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8677.56s)]
*  He had some of the craziest one punch knockouts ever. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8679.119999999999s)]
*  What is that? [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8681.88s)]
*  Does that career amount to like, is he sitting on money now like a guy like that? [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8682.52s)]
*  Or is he like? [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8687.119999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8687.52s)]
*  I haven't talked to Roy in forever. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8688.119999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8689.56s)]
*  He wound up fighting for a bunch of different organizations. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8690.52s)]
*  When he left the UFC, I think he fought for Bellator. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8694.6s)]
*  But that guy had some crazy highlights. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8697.52s)]
*  He knocked out Shaub one shot. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8700.08s)]
*  He knocked out a lot of people, dude. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8702.36s)]
*  He'd connect on people. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8705.4s)]
*  They would go night night. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8706.480000000001s)]
*  It was nuts, man. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8708.16s)]
*  He knocked out Mitrione. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8709.28s)]
*  He knocked out a lot of fucking big tough dudes. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8710.800000000001s)]
*  When anybody comes at Shaub, I'm always like, it's not even the wins he's had more than [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8713.32s)]
*  I'm like, this guy's not afraid of you. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8717.72s)]
*  He's been punched by the best. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8721.48s)]
*  I promise you, whatever you think he thinks you could do to him, it's not as bad as that. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8724.0s)]
*  He's been beaten up by world champions. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8727.72s)]
*  And he's knocked out world champs. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8729.4s)]
*  He knocked out Mirko Krokop, which is crazy. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8730.519999999999s)]
*  Mirko Krokop back in the day was the fucking man. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8733.76s)]
*  He was like the first elite kickboxer to really excel in MMA. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8737.56s)]
*  He was the first guy to show all these other strikers that you don't even know what you're [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8743.0s)]
*  talking about. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8746.119999999999s)]
*  When he started fighting in Pride, it was like, this is another level. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8746.72s)]
*  He would kick people in the body. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8750.56s)]
*  And you would see, there's a photo of him kicking Heath Herrig. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8752.679999999998s)]
*  And his fucking shin is halfway into his rib cage. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8756.24s)]
*  It's so nasty when you look at the photo of it. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8760.92s)]
*  You just go, the amount of power that that guy could generate in his kicks. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8764.0s)]
*  Like, there was nobody like that before him in kickboxing. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8767.84s)]
*  Or in MMA, rather. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8771.039999999999s)]
*  I felt so bad. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8772.359999999999s)]
*  That first UFC coming back during quarantine was so important to everybody. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8774.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it was the first one or the second one that came out. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8778.72s)]
*  But that was when I was like, man, you got to really pick your timing when you're [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8780.84s)]
*  going to shout out what you're dedicating a fight to. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8784.68s)]
*  Because there's that poor guy. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8787.44s)]
*  He lost his stepdaughter. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8788.84s)]
*  And then he came out wearing the shirt of the stepdaughter who passed away. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8791.28s)]
*  And it was all dedicated to her. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8795.16s)]
*  I mean, you can see, as Alistair Overeem beat him into submission with punches, [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8796.8s)]
*  the referee was even kind of going like, come on, man, please try to fight back. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8801.92s)]
*  I said at the end, Alistair Overeem should have been like, it's OK, everybody. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8806.759999999998s)]
*  I was also fighting for his stepdaughter. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8810.199999999999s)]
*  Like, yay. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8812.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8814.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, but to shout that out before, yeah, it's crazy. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8815.679999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of weight on YouTube. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8818.72s)]
*  Those are great YouTube compilations. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8819.88s)]
*  The cocky fighter comes in the ring to lose. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8821.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, there's always the guy pushes the guy at the weigh-ins and starts shit at the [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8824.48s)]
*  weigh-ins and gets knocked unconscious. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8827.519999999999s)]
*  There was one guy came in the UFC cage. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8829.160000000002s)]
*  I forget what it was, but the way he entered the ring, like, he did a thing where [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8832.04s)]
*  he hung on the outside of the cage and swung into the ring and did some crazy [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8834.52s)]
*  move, and then it was an immediate knockout. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8838.52s)]
*  It was like a 30-seconder. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8841.92s)]
*  Well, it's like you planning to talk to J. Lo. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8844.08s)]
*  You just got to let things happen. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8846.320000000002s)]
*  Just got to let things happen. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8847.560000000001s)]
*  You can't plan things out. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8848.52s)]
*  The inauthenticity of your planning will come to haunt you. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8850.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, also the shit you talk through life, also in broadcasting, as you start [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8855.160000000002s)]
*  to get guests, starts to haunt you. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8858.84s)]
*  It's like the thing like Howard Stern had to make a gazillion apologies, I assume, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8861.08s)]
*  by the time the guest he got on, because we've done it. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8864.08s)]
*  Man, we fucked up so bad. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8867.2s)]
*  We came in one day, we saw Bret Michaels in the fishbowl. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8868.84s)]
*  It was when me and Soda were doing the show still. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8871.2s)]
*  The fishbowl? [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8872.76s)]
*  Of a serious exam, it's like there's a studio that you could see into right in [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8873.56s)]
*  the front there where they do performances and stuff. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8878.28s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8880.28s)]
*  And we were up in the fishbowl one time, we saw Bret Michaels when we came in [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8881.0s)]
*  talking to somebody. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8886.12s)]
*  And then we go on air and almost for the bit we're like, how do we never get [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8887.400000000001s)]
*  offered these guys? [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8890.28s)]
*  There's always celebrities here and they weren't even brought to us as we can get [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8890.960000000001s)]
*  them. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8893.720000000001s)]
*  That's so fucking crazy. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8893.880000000001s)]
*  And I go, right now as we speak, Bret Michaels is out there. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8895.6s)]
*  And then we said something about his bandana being attached to his hair. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8898.36s)]
*  And I think Soda said they lower his bandana and hair onto him like Darth Vader. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8903.44s)]
*  He just sits there and they lower it on him. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8908.28s)]
*  And then they come back and they go, he said he's willing to come in. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8910.92s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8914.36s)]
*  Then he comes in and he's lovely. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8915.48s)]
*  This guy was making future promises with us of what stuff he wants to do with us [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8918.08s)]
*  and hang out and come be a part of his summer festival and broadcast from there [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8922.439999999999s)]
*  because he loves us so much. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8926.8s)]
*  But his manager was listening the whole time and he said as soon as he left the [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8928.6s)]
*  studio, they went, those guys are not your friends. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8931.32s)]
*  And you're like, ah shit. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8934.199999999999s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8936.76s)]
*  Shit. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8937.08s)]
*  He's got to understand, they didn't know you. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8937.84s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8940.52s)]
*  No, they know you. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8941.0s)]
*  Cory Feldman hates my guts and it's like. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8941.92s)]
*  What would you do? [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8944.96s)]
*  Well, I've never nonstop talking about him. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8946.039999999999s)]
*  I've seen the video. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8947.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8948.759999999998s)]
*  We've never had stuff going. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8949.279999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8950.599999999999s)]
*  Do you hate on his dancing? [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8951.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8951.96s)]
*  Maybe it's getting better. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8952.359999999999s)]
*  We're not even hating on it at all. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8953.24s)]
*  I love it. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8955.16s)]
*  I want to do nothing different. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8956.199999999999s)]
*  And I wish they tried. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8959.16s)]
*  He tried to have us not allowed at his show and he opened for Limp Bizkit. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8959.919999999998s)]
*  Not allowed? [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8963.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8964.199999999999s)]
*  And this head of security was a fan. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8964.359999999999s)]
*  He came over to me and Bobby Kelly and he was like, yeah. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8965.72s)]
*  He goes, he was asking if you guys were coming. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8968.48s)]
*  I said yes. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8970.279999999999s)]
*  Then he asked if he could know where you were. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8971.759999999998s)]
*  Then he asked if we could not let you in. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8973.24s)]
*  I was like, well, they're not doing anything. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8974.4s)]
*  They're not threatening you or anything. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8976.08s)]
*  They're coming to watch a show. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8977.08s)]
*  And he was like, well, can I at least know where they're sitting at? [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8978.32s)]
*  And he goes, it'll be wherever the most excited people are. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8980.88s)]
*  And son of a bitch, where are we? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8983.72s)]
*  I mean, we were a sprout of grass on a dirt field of people. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8985.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, we were the only ones. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8988.6s)]
*  We were hyped. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8990.16s)]
*  I know all the words. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8990.72s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8991.76s)]
*  But that was the genius of Howard Stern that I fucked up. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8993.72s)]
*  When I started getting the broadcasting, I broadcasted always [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=8998.88s)]
*  like it was going to be me talking to a friend or friends shooting the shit. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9001.560000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9005.12s)]
*  Not that you're going to come across these people. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9005.560000000001s)]
*  So I would have played more. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9006.800000000001s)]
*  What Howard Stern was always great at is like, take the lunatic. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9008.6s)]
*  But he's always going to be like, no, you're great. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9011.04s)]
*  Dude, you're the best. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9013.76s)]
*  And let the world make the joke. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9015.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9017.0s)]
*  Instead, like I go at it. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9018.0s)]
*  But I was like, man, I would have loved to just have Corey Feldman come in [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9019.04s)]
*  bi-monthly to do it. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9022.08s)]
*  Hey, you got a new song? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9023.2s)]
*  Play it, dude. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9024.04s)]
*  I'll bite my fucking finger. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9024.880000000001s)]
*  Poor Corey. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9028.08s)]
*  Poor Corey. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9029.560000000001s)]
*  The thing about Corey that really does bother me, like legitimately. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9030.2s)]
*  We're so happy. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9033.6s)]
*  Oh, this is him? [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9036.04s)]
*  Let me hear this. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9036.76s)]
*  He yells at his band. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9049.28s)]
*  It's such a weird. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9050.2s)]
*  The guitar solo. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9056.560000000001s)]
*  He doesn't know how to play the guitar. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9058.400000000001s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9059.8s)]
*  But he just does a solo. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9060.64s)]
*  How can you do a guitar solo if you don't know how to play a guitar? [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9061.679999999998s)]
*  Does he actually not know how to play a guitar? [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9064.519999999999s)]
*  Like, do you know how to play? [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9066.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9067.48s)]
*  But you don't have to know how to play to know he does not know how to play. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9068.359999999999s)]
*  I could do what he's doing for sure. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9071.679999999998s)]
*  But then here's what he did. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9073.64s)]
*  I don't know what the trickle back is. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9075.72s)]
*  But I said after that was going viral, the guitar, I was like, why doesn't this [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9077.08s)]
*  guy just come out and say like, like if he's kind of like, no, I get it. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9081.48s)]
*  I get the joke, too. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9085.439999999999s)]
*  Like then it kind of puts people in there and stops them in their tracks. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9087.160000000002s)]
*  And then he kind of did that. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9090.52s)]
*  He came and goes, of course, it's the worst guitar solo ever. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9091.560000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9094.28s)]
*  That's why I'm doing it. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9095.12s)]
*  Like, it's funny. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9096.12s)]
*  And it's like, no. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9096.800000000001s)]
*  And Fred Durst came out to watch him do it to prove he was doing it. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9098.640000000001s)]
*  Because Fred Durst is smart, like Howard Stern. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9102.240000000002s)]
*  He makes him think he's his friend. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9105.68s)]
*  But he's a way bigger enemy than I could ever be to him. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9107.36s)]
*  Because he's going like, dude, go make an ass of yourself in front of all these [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9110.960000000001s)]
*  people. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9114.0s)]
*  He's a young star guy that grew up to become a man. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9114.800000000001s)]
*  And they're all weird. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9118.72s)]
*  There's no way you could be a star at six years old and come out normal. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9120.32s)]
*  You don't have a normal life. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9124.64s)]
*  It's impossible. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9125.800000000001s)]
*  Is there nobody? [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9126.84s)]
*  I don't think there's one. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9127.76s)]
*  Everyone that I've met. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9129.24s)]
*  I mean, there's some really talented people like Miley Cyrus and people that [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9130.0s)]
*  were childhood stars that are cool to talk to. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9133.16s)]
*  But they struggle. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9135.800000000001s)]
*  It's a struggle. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9137.2s)]
*  All of them struggle. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9137.92s)]
*  Everybody struggles. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9139.0s)]
*  Like, Punky Brewster's probably fine right now. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9139.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9141.76s)]
*  I don't even know what that is. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9142.32s)]
*  Punky Brewster? [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9143.32s)]
*  You don't remember that show? [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9144.0s)]
*  I don't remember. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9144.56s)]
*  So Leo Moon Fry. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9145.24s)]
*  She had the biggest titties when we were kids. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9146.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9147.599999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9147.839999999998s)]
*  She made a great documentary a few years back. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9148.4s)]
*  That's right. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9150.16s)]
*  But then she became a mom and got out of the business. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9150.64s)]
*  Yeah, you can do that. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9154.08s)]
*  But if you want to still try it, if you're still clamoring for the fame. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9155.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9159.0s)]
*  But I don't know how many people came out of the fame as a young person and were [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9160.24s)]
*  fine. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9164.64s)]
*  But the people that stay and keep doing it, they're not fine. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9165.359999999999s)]
*  Most of them. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9169.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe there's a few. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9170.24s)]
*  I'm not saying it's impossible to do, but I'm saying the challenge of becoming [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9171.76s)]
*  a normal person with a normal view of the world when you're getting doted on, [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9175.68s)]
*  when you're six, and you're the moneymaker in the house when you're a little kid. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9182.16s)]
*  Like, your parents stop working to manage you, like that kind of shit. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9187.0s)]
*  Like those Carter kids. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9189.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's brutal. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9191.56s)]
*  Aaron Carter kid was lost. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9192.32s)]
*  He was doing gay porn at the end. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9194.880000000001s)]
*  Not gay porn, but like, gay cam stuff. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9196.16s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9199.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9200.08s)]
*  Just whacking off on camera with face tattoos. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9201.480000000001s)]
*  Didn't they have like a boxing match against Lamar Odom? [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9203.52s)]
*  They supposed to. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9206.12s)]
*  I don't know if it ever ended up happening. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9206.68s)]
*  I think they did. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9207.84s)]
*  I think they did. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9209.0s)]
*  And it's so crazy, because he's like this skinny guy with like not a muscle on his [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9210.12s)]
*  body, and Lamar Odom used to play for the NBA. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9213.880000000001s)]
*  Isn't that true? [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9217.44s)]
*  They did have it. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9219.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9219.720000000001s)]
*  It did happen? [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9220.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9220.800000000001s)]
*  Lamar just beats the brakes off him. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9220.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, you have to assume. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9222.800000000001s)]
*  He's a former professional athlete. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9223.800000000001s)]
*  The fact that Chuck Liddell is the fucking... [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9226.28s)]
*  Look at the size difference. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9228.52s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9229.88s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9231.439999999999s)]
*  He's trying to punch him. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9232.039999999999s)]
*  Aaron Carter's... [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9233.0s)]
*  He's letting him hit him. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9233.72s)]
*  He just kind of... [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9236.24s)]
*  He touches him once. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9237.359999999999s)]
*  He's like letting him hit him. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9239.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9241.839999999998s)]
*  It's sad to watch. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9242.92s)]
*  It's almost like he looked like, oh, there you hit him with a left hand. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9244.16s)]
*  What's really sad about it is people is... [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9247.24s)]
*  It's not just people watching you fight that wigs me out so much. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9251.24s)]
*  It's that there's something that knowing how to fight and the form of what you're [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9254.8s)]
*  doing looking any kind of good, especially if you're fight... [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9259.24s)]
*  Street fights, I mean, when they devolve into like men swinging like this, [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9261.16s)]
*  you're like, oh, man, we really all suck at the end of the day at this. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9266.24s)]
*  It's so hard to keep a fighter's composure on a street fight. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9269.4s)]
*  Especially if shit's going down. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9273.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, unless you do it all the time. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9274.56s)]
*  I remember watching these two guys fight in front of the comedy store. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9276.16s)]
*  And it was across the street when the House of Blues was over there. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9279.52s)]
*  So it was right in front in the parking lot. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9283.64s)]
*  These guys start yelling at each other and blah, blah, blah. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9285.32s)]
*  And they get out like almost in traffic. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9287.6s)]
*  They're like on the sidewalk, like right where the street tumbles out. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9290.72s)]
*  And I see these two guys facing off and I see the white guy. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9294.039999999999s)]
*  There's like a white guy and this looks like an out of shape [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9298.88s)]
*  African American fella. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9304.519999999999s)]
*  And the white guy starts swinging with almost like with his eyes closed. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9306.199999999999s)]
*  And then the bus goes in between them so I can't see them. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9312.0s)]
*  And then as the bus goes back, the white guy's out cold, flat on his back, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9315.640000000001s)]
*  spread eagle, and the black guy's already running away. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9320.68s)]
*  He's out cold. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9325.68s)]
*  They were just squabbling in front and I don't remember how it was. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9327.04s)]
*  I just remember this. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9330.640000000001s)]
*  I remember this and then the bus. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9331.92s)]
*  And then out cold. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9334.2s)]
*  Do you have to deal with, because I mean I know from like when Louis was working [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9336.2s)]
*  with Biz Bing and stuff and he'd go to Vegas. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9339.24s)]
*  He'd be like, they were all surprised at how many drunk guys at the casino try to [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9342.16s)]
*  like give him shit. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9345.92s)]
*  There's a bunch of idiots out there. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9346.960000000001s)]
*  I was like, do people come to you all the time? [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9348.08s)]
*  It's like, you know karate for real, dude? [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9349.36s)]
*  No. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9351.92s)]
*  If you hang out with enough drunks long enough, someone will just avoid those areas. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9353.44s)]
*  It's just, it's drunk people. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9359.6s)]
*  But if you're one of them and you're hanging out and you're drinking with people, [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9360.880000000001s)]
*  yeah, there's a bunch. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9363.12s)]
*  There's people who used to get stupid with Chocolate Dell. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9363.84s)]
*  And Chocolate Dell was the light heavyweight champion. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9365.68s)]
*  He was the scariest fucking human on the planet. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9367.52s)]
*  And people would get stupid with him. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9369.76s)]
*  They're on coke. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9370.96s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9371.839999999998s)]
*  They're out of their fucking minds. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9373.439999999999s)]
*  You think you could win that fight. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9374.4s)]
*  People are gagged up, fucked up. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9375.519999999999s)]
*  They're all, they're crazy anyway. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9377.679999999998s)]
*  They're schizophrenic. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9379.039999999999s)]
*  People are, there's so many nuts out there in this world. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9380.64s)]
*  The most thing about fighting too is endurance. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9383.119999999999s)]
*  That's what most people don't have in any kind of fight. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9385.759999999998s)]
*  If it's not over in 30 seconds, everyone's holding each other. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9388.4s)]
*  One of my favorite things I watch, I watched a lot of like body cam crime shit on YouTube. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9391.919999999998s)]
*  And there's one, it's a Key West. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9397.519999999999s)]
*  It's a couple. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9399.6s)]
*  The guy's hammered. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9401.84s)]
*  He essentially, he's got money for sure. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9403.52s)]
*  This guy, he's just trying to like, you know, pay his bill with a library card or something [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9405.92s)]
*  where he's like, he doesn't know what's going on. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9409.44s)]
*  And he's barking at the staff and then someone on the staff pushes his face. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9411.6s)]
*  And then it breaks into this melee, but it's, you know, [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9415.68s)]
*  50 something year old white people getting into a fight. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9419.12s)]
*  And one guy gets him in a side headlock, useless. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9421.84s)]
*  And then they both sort of fall down. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9426.640000000001s)]
*  The husband and this guy who intervenes and the guy who intervenes eventually [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9428.48s)]
*  puts his like legs, you know, puts in his hooks basically, but does nothing. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9433.279999999999s)]
*  Doesn't choke the guy out. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9438.96s)]
*  There's kind of sitting there, two old exhausted guys. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9440.16s)]
*  10 minutes later, at least they get up and they kind of have like the [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9443.359999999999s)]
*  you're a pussy, you're a pussy kind of thing. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9446.88s)]
*  And they leave. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9449.119999999999s)]
*  Then it cuts back to the cops outside and they want to talk to the guy who intervened. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9450.08s)]
*  Not mad at him. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9454.48s)]
*  They just want to get his side of the story what happened. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9455.119999999999s)]
*  And this guy is just an old man and the cops are questioning him. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9457.359999999999s)]
*  And they start to lose their patience because he just wants to keep telling his hero story. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9461.599999999999s)]
*  He just watched what happened. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9465.679999999998s)]
*  It's just two old men holding each other on the ground. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9466.72s)]
*  He goes, guy came out of nowhere and punched me and I grew up doing this shit, man. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9468.08s)]
*  So, you know, I told the guy, I go, you got two ways this can go tonight. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9473.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9478.0s)]
*  He goes, you could, you can knock it off or I could beat the fuck out of you. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9478.88s)]
*  He's telling this to the cops? [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9483.84s)]
*  Yeah, you might be able to find we're very classy. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9485.92s)]
*  Body cam, we're very classy people. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9489.52s)]
*  Maybe, hopefully you could find it. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9493.84s)]
*  But it's, but when he's telling the cop, then he goes, [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9494.960000000001s)]
*  he's like, I told him I could beat the fuck out of you. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9497.84s)]
*  He goes, all right. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9499.52s)]
*  So then you were able to like subdue him. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9500.560000000001s)]
*  He's like, yeah. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9502.480000000001s)]
*  He goes, I took him down. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9503.36s)]
*  I'm like, he goes, I don't want a problem with you. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9505.28s)]
*  And I go, you, you want no parts of what I'm about to bring to you, my man. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9507.44s)]
*  And it's all this. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9512.160000000002s)]
*  None of this happened. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9513.04s)]
*  You just watched the video where you just grabbed them. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9514.0s)]
*  They, they flopped on the ground and laid there exhausted for 10 minutes while the, [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9516.0s)]
*  while the lady screams. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9520.08s)]
*  It's nothing. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9521.84s)]

*  Will we lose the YouTube rights? [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9535.04s)]
*  What happens? [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9536.88s)]

*  No, my, I was probably the first guy. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9581.2s)]
*  These guys fucking with the waitress. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9584.64s)]
*  So I said, dude, what are you doing? [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9586.24s)]
*  The guy fucking punched me. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9587.36s)]
*  I said, dude, you don't want to get into this with me. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9588.4s)]
*  I grew up doing this shit. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9591.76s)]
*  I said, don't do it. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9594.8s)]
*  I drugged him. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9595.6s)]
*  Nothing around. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9596.0s)]
*  I said, you got two options. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9596.56s)]
*  You either stop or I'm going to beat the living fuck out of you. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9598.32s)]
*  Okay. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9601.12s)]
*  So I said, that's how it's going to go. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9602.0s)]
*  And he said, I want a problem with you. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9603.52s)]
*  I said, you want nothing to do with what I'm going to bring to you. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9604.880000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9611.92s)]
*  No, it's right there. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9612.24s)]
*  And then he goes, there's only one more thing where the cop cuts them off. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9612.960000000001s)]
*  So you were on the ground with him holding on to him. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9616.32s)]
*  I held on to him and said until he said. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9618.24s)]
*  Yeah, right there. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9620.4s)]
*  The cop cuts him off. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9621.2s)]
*  He doesn't want to hear what he says anymore. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9622.0s)]
*  He goes, so you were able to get him on the ground. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9623.12s)]
*  He goes, got him on the ground. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9624.4s)]
*  And I said to him, he had him on the ground. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9625.92s)]
*  Stop telling us you're. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9628.24s)]
*  I mean, it's the way this guy speaks. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9629.76s)]
*  It's like the Bushido code states that if the weapon is drawn, it must taste blood before put away. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9631.04s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9637.04s)]
*  White people fighting. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9637.84s)]
*  That's what this is hilarious. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9638.640000000001s)]
*  And it goes nowhere. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9640.240000000002s)]
*  No one's going on the ground. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9642.240000000002s)]
*  What's going on? [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9643.04s)]
*  This is a lie. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9643.84s)]
*  Oh, now they're on the ground. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9645.28s)]
*  He's a guy drug him on the ground. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9647.28s)]
*  Really? [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9648.560000000001s)]
*  The husband drags him on the ground. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9648.880000000001s)]
*  Technically. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9650.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a disaster. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9651.2s)]
*  But tell us that my friend Justin Silver used to have my favorite joke about that kind of [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9653.28s)]
*  personality though. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9657.68s)]
*  He's like, he's because I'm a liar because I lie about everything. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9658.240000000002s)]
*  And he was like, I'm the guy who like, you know, gets into a situation with somebody in the street. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9661.04s)]
*  And then I don't do anything. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9666.720000000001s)]
*  And then I go home, shadow box and call my friends and tell them all the things that I wish I did. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9668.160000000002s)]
*  Like it actually happened. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9671.84s)]
*  And his line was, if I did all the things I told my friends I did, my name would be Indiana Bon Jovi Balboa. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9673.36s)]
*  When you're a kid and you you have a situation like that happen, the rest of the day you play it in [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9680.960000000001s)]
*  your head like what I should have said. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9687.52s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9689.12s)]
*  Wish I had another chance. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9689.92s)]
*  I would have said, well, fuck you because this was not. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9691.2s)]
*  That's the worst. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9694.0s)]
*  When it goes away. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9694.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9695.84s)]
*  Those internal dialogue things like for the rest of the day, what should I have said? [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9696.32s)]
*  And you like plot it out and plan and scheme. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9699.84s)]
*  I'll find him again one day. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9702.32s)]
*  One day. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9704.08s)]
*  I'm going to tell him. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9704.56s)]
*  Find that asshole that I've done dumb things though, where it's like, I don't even know, [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9705.36s)]
*  with no real trained preparation for any of these situations. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9709.28s)]
*  But like I also, when I, I always had a car. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9713.92s)]
*  And when you're younger and have a car, it's destroying you financially. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9717.279999999999s)]
*  Usually like at how much it costs to have a car and everything. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9720.64s)]
*  So it means a lot to you. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9723.439999999999s)]
*  No matter how shitty it is. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9725.199999999999s)]
*  When people would fucking hit my car. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9726.16s)]
*  Some New York's a big thing with that. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9727.599999999999s)]
*  You know, you stop short and a pedestrian just like, you know, slaps the front of your car or [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9728.88s)]
*  something to this day, I would get irate by that to this day. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9733.439999999999s)]
*  I think about one guy. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9736.48s)]
*  I had a little Honda CRX and I was driving in New York and I was making my way to this intersection [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9737.84s)]
*  and I got stuck in between lights and then people started walking. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9742.96s)]
*  And I tried to find like some space where I could not be in the intersection. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9746.24s)]
*  There was a nice gap. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9750.96s)]
*  And so this guy wasn't close to the car. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9752.32s)]
*  So I started moving forward and he whacks my fucking car with a briefcase. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9754.64s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to pull over. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9760.32s)]
*  I'm going to put this guy in the hospital. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9762.48s)]
*  This crazy wild thought, like I'm going to pull over and I'm just going to go smash this dude. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9765.119999999999s)]
*  And I said, no, just drive, just drive, just drive. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9769.92s)]
*  And like for years, I would think about that guy. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9772.4s)]
*  For years, this arrogant cocksucker hitting my car with a fucking briefcase. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9776.48s)]
*  It's what unites me and Lewis. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9782.8s)]
*  We both have a crazy need for justice. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9785.52s)]
*  It's why I like those stupid revenge movies. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9789.6s)]
*  It's just that. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9791.44s)]
*  It's the thing. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9793.36s)]
*  It's like the guy who did that thing. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9793.84s)]
*  I have like a, I bet he won't do that anymore. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9795.92s)]
*  I bet he won't do that anymore after I've sorted the situation out. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9798.24s)]
*  But I mean, it's so dumb. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9801.44s)]
*  It's a dude thing too. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9804.8s)]
*  Getting out of the car. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9805.92s)]
*  One time so early when I was coming to New York and I had my, what became my ex-wife, [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9807.92s)]
*  we were just dating at the time in a car, driving a Saturn guy trying to impress two girls he's [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9813.76s)]
*  with and he goes by just like slaps the front of the car and it stayed. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9819.76s)]
*  And then they walk into Washington Square Park and I like just stewing in it. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9824.24s)]
*  Like I barked some shit out the window. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9830.24s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9831.6s)]
*  For seconds. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9832.48s)]
*  I'm stewing in it. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9834.32s)]
*  And then I pull over with my new girlfriend. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9835.92s)]
*  I go, wait here. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9837.68s)]
*  And she goes, what? [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9839.52s)]
*  And then I begin to run after this guy into the park. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9840.32s)]
*  What I'm not thinking about is as I'm running, when I finally find this guy on the other [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9844.32s)]
*  side of Washington Square Park, I turn around, dude, he could have pushed me over with a [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9848.88s)]
*  feather. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9852.56s)]
*  I was like, what's up motherfucker? [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9852.88s)]
*  You want to fucking slap your ex-wife's car? [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9855.12s)]
*  And luckily I just scared him with my size, I guess, ultimately or something because like [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9858.16s)]
*  he didn't do anything. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9862.56s)]
*  But I was like, as soon as I got there and spun this guy around, I'm like, [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9863.2s)]
*  I'm done. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9865.68s)]
*  I'm so exhausted from running. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9866.48s)]
*  I never run. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9867.68s)]
*  I sprinted to find him without thinking that I'm giving all my energy to that run. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9869.2s)]
*  And I'm like, you need like a half hour to recover. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9872.64s)]
*  He just fucking hit my car, man. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9875.2s)]
*  And he was like, luckily like apologetic and like, whoa, dude, I don't want any trouble. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9876.800000000001s)]

*  It's fucking raining, I don't want any trouble. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9882.4s)]
*  I took 10 extra minutes walking back to the car, leaving my girlfriend in the car [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9886.800000000001s)]
*  because I didn't want her to see how heavy I was breathing. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9891.28s)]
*  Either we get it all back together and just come back to the car and be like, scared that pussy. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9894.56s)]
*  Such a dumb thing to do because you could do it to the wrong guy. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9901.76s)]
*  I watched my instincts are terrible on it because I do. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9905.359999999999s)]
*  I don't get out thinking like, and then as soon as someone put a gun, I'd be like, none [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9907.519999999999s)]

*  And the guy wasn't doing it. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9958.08s)]
*  He was just arguing with the cops. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9959.44s)]
*  I don't know if that was a cop. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9962.48s)]
*  Is that a cop? [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9963.52s)]

*  White gloves. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9969.04s)]
*  The gloves are, he gets his dukes up. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9969.76s)]
*  Like both of them, he had some training, but he massively overestimated his ability. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9974.16s)]
*  Look at this shitty double leg. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9978.24s)]

*  Scared of the concrete. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9985.28s)]
*  So he's trying to double leg without his knees going to the ground. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9986.48s)]
*  He doesn't want to really drive forward. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9989.199999999999s)]
*  There's a great video of a very in-shape cop. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9991.44s)]
*  He's going at it with a teenager who's really talking shit. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=9994.72s)]

*  And he just, when he gets in his face one time, he just grabs him by the shoulders, [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10017.04s)]
*  puts his foot behind him. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10020.560000000001s)]
*  I mean, places him on the concrete. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10021.36s)]

*  Well, kids are just- [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10030.080000000002s)]
*  And fat women getting tasered. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10030.720000000001s)]
*  That's my other favorite thing. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10031.76s)]
*  I bet that young man was under 25. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10032.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, no doubt. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10034.800000000001s)]
*  His brain was mush. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10035.6s)]
*  No doubt. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10036.96s)]
*  And then, but it's funny when they have to come back and they go, [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10037.679999999998s)]
*  I was being crazy back there. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10039.92s)]
*  That's why they send those young boys out to war. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10041.199999999999s)]
*  Because they're all fucking piss and vinegar. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10043.599999999999s)]
*  All piss and vinegar with a non-fully deformed brain. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10045.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10048.56s)]
*  Non-fully formed brain. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10048.8s)]
*  They just fucking take that gun and here's some math. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10050.16s)]
*  Let's fucking go. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10052.96s)]
*  There was a guy in the audience last night, we did story wars at mothership. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10054.16s)]
*  And there was a guy in the front who wears a brace around his body. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10056.64s)]
*  Like, we asked him why. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10059.839999999998s)]
*  He was stabbed in Afghanistan, hand-to-hand combat. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10062.08s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10064.56s)]
*  It was a gunfight and it ended up being hand-to-hand combat. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10066.0s)]
*  He said he knocked the guy down, didn't confirm that he was out. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10068.4s)]
*  And then when he took his tension away, the guy reached up and said, stabbed him. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10073.04s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10076.0s)]
*  Right in the fucking chest, basically. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10076.32s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10077.84s)]
*  And we were like, and we're looking at this guy, we go, in Afghanistan, what is he? [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10079.44s)]
*  He was 18. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10083.44s)]
*  He was 18. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10085.04s)]
*  Wow. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10086.880000000001s)]
*  I think he said the 16-year-old was the kid who stabbed him was 16. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10088.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10091.52s)]
*  It's such a wild thing. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10092.48s)]
*  It's intense. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10093.279999999999s)]
*  It's a little too intense. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10094.08s)]
*  Don't get in fights, kids. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10095.52s)]
*  That's our message, right? [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10096.48s)]
*  If you can avoid it. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10097.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10098.56s)]
*  I've avoided all of them. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10099.119999999999s)]
*  I tried to, I got into a thing, a road rage thing, where I knocked a guy out. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10100.4s)]
*  He wasn't very big. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10105.359999999999s)]
*  And I basically got out of the car and he was right away, didn't want to do anything. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10106.56s)]
*  And I mushed his face. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10111.52s)]
*  He was drunk and I kept mushing his face until he would throw up a drunken punch. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10113.119999999999s)]
*  And then I hit him and I caught him. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10117.199999999999s)]
*  Only time I'm going to fight in my life where I caught him is when I'm in the car. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10118.56s)]
*  I caught him first shot and he literally folded on the ground. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10122.08s)]
*  And then I got in my car, drove away with my current girlfriend, Christine. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10126.24s)]
*  And when we got a few blocks away, my adrenaline started going down. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10130.56s)]
*  And I was like, and so jokingly almost, I just look at her and I kissed my bicep, one shot. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10135.92s)]
*  And she goes, she was really pissed. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10142.4s)]
*  She didn't think it was funny or anything. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10145.44s)]
*  And I was like, but it wasn't even kind of hot that I just knocked that guy out one shot. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10148.08s)]
*  And she was like, no, like what if you killed him? [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10152.08s)]
*  Like his head bounced off the ground. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10154.72s)]
*  What it's all for what? [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10156.08s)]
*  And I was like, man, that is a great point, I guess. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10156.88s)]
*  It's a real good point. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10159.12s)]
*  What a great fucking point. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10160.0s)]
*  Because I'm walking away from that like, hey, I didn't even get touched. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10161.12s)]
*  And I got sweet, beautiful justice, you know, the way I'm always searching for. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10164.48s)]
*  And she was like, no, what if you killed him? [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10167.92s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, there is a point there for sure. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10169.84s)]
*  I often think about that with that guy. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10171.36s)]
*  You know, but yourself getting killed. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10172.72s)]
*  What if you kill somebody? [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10173.92s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10175.2s)]
*  Yeah, you never punch somebody in the face on the concrete if you can. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10176.08s)]
*  Like a good trained fighter probably punching the body. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10179.6s)]
*  Just because they don't want to go to jail forever. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10182.72s)]
*  Like Kevin James friends went to jail for like seven years. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10184.8s)]
*  He was a bouncer at a nightclub in Long Island. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10188.56s)]
*  Knocked the guy out, the guy falls, hits his head, dies. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10191.52s)]
*  Happens. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10194.4s)]
*  Yeah, but didn't like didn't Harry Houdini get killed from a gut shot? [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10194.8s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10197.36s)]
*  Yeah, like a punch to the stomach. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10198.0s)]
*  He died days later. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10199.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10200.72s)]
*  Because like an organ busted. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10200.96s)]
*  You never think about that. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10203.68s)]
*  You want to give everything you got to a face punch. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10204.48s)]
*  And then you're like, boy, I sure hope I don't blind him forever. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10206.24s)]
*  These are all things could happen. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLLmFpomLM&t=10209.12s)]
