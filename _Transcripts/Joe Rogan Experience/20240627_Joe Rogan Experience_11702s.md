# Joe Rogan Experience #2019 - Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6.0s)]
*  Hey Tim. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=12.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan, thank you for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=14.0s)]
*  What's up my brother? Always good to see you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=15.0s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=16.0s)]
*  You escaped from LA before the massive strike. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah, well there was a, I think it didn't affect flights as much as I thought, but it was 11,000 city workers decided to strike. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=19.0s)]
*  And a lot of those are, but air traffic controllers are federal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=28.0s)]
*  But the baggage claims all screwed up. They cancelled a bunch of stuff. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=31.0s)]
*  I don't know, it's 11,000 city workers. I don't know what they're, what you know, it's I think it's a bunch of different groups of them that want stuff. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=35.0s)]
*  Yeah, is there like specific demands? Like is it pay increase? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=45.0s)]
*  Maybe they want to stop getting killed by the homeless. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=48.0s)]
*  Maybe it's very reasonable. Maybe there's nothing to do with money. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=51.0s)]
*  And they're like, we just want to stop being like people flinging their excrement at us while we're cleaning the park. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=55.0s)]
*  Could be. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=60.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what it is. I don't know what the demands are. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=61.0s)]
*  Maybe they're scared they're going to be replaced by AI, like the actors and writers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=65.0s)]
*  They might be. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=69.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=70.0s)]
*  You know what the sketchiest thing that I saw about the whole actor writer thing was that for background players, when people work on a film, they wanted access to their image forever. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=71.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=82.0s)]
*  So they would take you and make a digital version of you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=83.0s)]
*  So if you're like a background guy, instead of paying background people to hang around in some crowd scene, they will now just fill it in with you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=86.0s)]
*  So the same background people, which is like one of the nuttiest fucking like fringe theories of any catastrophe is that you have these these actors. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=93.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=107.0s)]
*  What do they call them? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=108.0s)]
*  Crisis actors. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=109.0s)]
*  Crisis actors. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=110.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=111.0s)]
*  So these people are hired by the federal government. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=114.0s)]
*  They appear in like multiple different scenarios where they say that something happened to them and the shooter entered into the building. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=122.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=123.0s)]
*  Well, they're striking next. The crisis actors. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=124.0s)]
*  They're going to go, I am worried that my likeness will be used as Sandy Hook in perpetuity without my. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=132.0s)]
*  It's weird because it doesn't seem like there's a way to prevent it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=133.0s)]
*  You know, because digital use of your imagery. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=140.0s)]
*  Well, everybody's every business in the world is using AI. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=142.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=146.0s)]
*  You know, these movie studios and streamers spent a lot of money investing in AI technology during the pandemic. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=147.0s)]
*  They a lot of in-house AI projects. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=156.0s)]
*  And, you know, I imagine that they're going to utilize that technology to some degree. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=158.0s)]
*  I agree, though, that it's creepy and it will eliminate a lot of jobs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=164.0s)]
*  And if there's a way to stop them, great. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=168.0s)]
*  But is there? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=171.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=173.0s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be a way. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=174.0s)]
*  No, that train is rolling and there's a lot of track in front of it and it has insane momentum and you're not going to put your hand out and stop it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=176.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=184.0s)]
*  You might mitigate the effects. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=185.0s)]
*  Maybe the government would pass like a law saying, listen, you can't replace more than 10 percent of your work. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=187.0s)]
*  Force with AI over the next five years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=193.0s)]
*  I don't know if that would even be a feasible thing to do, but maybe they could do something like that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=195.0s)]
*  But the problem is, if you have a business and the business can be better run by AI, do you have a responsibility to hire human beings to do a lesser job? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=200.0s)]
*  Great question. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=210.0s)]
*  It's a real good question. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=212.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=213.0s)]
*  And if you listen to these like Drake songs that are coming out with AI, so Eminem song that just came out with, they're good. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=222.0s)]
*  They're good. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=223.0s)]
*  I was just having a conversation with Post Malone about it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=224.0s)]
*  You know, Post uses like auto tune, but he writes all his own songs, you know, and he performs all his own songs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=226.0s)]
*  And I think his fans want to know that's him singing a song. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=234.0s)]
*  They would probably still enjoy a fake Post Malone song. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=239.0s)]
*  But dude, I saw him live last night when you see these people singing along with him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=243.0s)]
*  It's something really powerful, man. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=248.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=250.0s)]
*  It's not just like a regular concert. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=251.0s)]
*  They fucking love that dude. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=253.0s)]
*  Well, look at the Taylor Swift thing, which I feel very left out of because I'm the only person that has not seen it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=257.0s)]
*  And I don't get it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=263.0s)]
*  Like she's clearly talented and God bless. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=265.0s)]
*  I just don't have that thing where you're not a girl. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=267.0s)]
*  That's all. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=270.0s)]
*  But the dudes are there too. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=272.0s)]
*  Dave Portnoy loves it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=273.0s)]
*  A lot of people love it and I don't get it and I just and I don't begrudge anyone else getting it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=274.0s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=280.0s)]
*  But maybe if you go to one live, you'll get it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=283.0s)]
*  Because it's supposed to be a spectacular show. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=284.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=286.0s)]
*  Tons of dancers and visuals. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=287.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=289.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=290.0s)]
*  That's phenomenal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=293.0s)]
*  I grew up listening to people like Tina Turner and Janis Joplin. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=294.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=297.0s)]
*  So to me, it's like Taylor Swift. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=298.0s)]
*  It's different. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=299.0s)]
*  It's different. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=300.0s)]
*  That's all I'm going to say. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=301.0s)]
*  I don't want to be attacked. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=302.0s)]
*  I don't want people following me. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=303.0s)]
*  It's just it's different. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=304.0s)]
*  It's just it's you know what I mean? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=305.0s)]
*  It's like this is like the same thing about the Barbie movie. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=307.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=310.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not for you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=311.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=312.0s)]
*  And if it's not for you and you're going and giving this scathing review of something that's clearly not for you. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=313.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=319.0s)]
*  Look, I get it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=320.0s)]
*  If that's your business, you're in the culture war business. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=321.0s)]
*  You're in the critique business. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=324.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=325.0s)]
*  You're in the reaction video business. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=326.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=328.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=329.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=330.0s)]
*  I'm a professional person. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=331.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=332.0s)]
*  Like imagine being mad that people like Taylor Swift. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=333.0s)]
*  No, there's no anger. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=336.0s)]
*  I would I actually like most cultural things. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=337.0s)]
*  I wish I got it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=340.0s)]
*  My life would be easier if I got like I would be more included. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=342.0s)]
*  I would be able to participate in conversations easier. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=346.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=349.0s)]
*  I want to be in. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=350.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=351.0s)]
*  All these things that people like that I can't get into. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=352.0s)]
*  I want to be in. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=356.0s)]
*  The Barbie movie is an interesting one. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=359.0s)]
*  Barbie is clearly a movie that's made for girls and everybody else. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=360.0s)]
*  But also it's Barbie movie. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=365.0s)]
*  Barbie's appeal to girls. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=367.0s)]
*  It's like saying Commando was not just for guys. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=369.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=371.0s)]
*  You know, there's a few. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=372.0s)]
*  There's a few people on the margins that will like it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=373.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=377.0s)]
*  There's a few lesbians that go to see Commando and they're very into it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=378.0s)]
*  Few gay men really love Barbie. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=381.0s)]
*  But the vast majority, it is gender specific. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=383.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=386.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=387.0s)]
*  I was in a tremendous amount of outrage about that movie. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=388.0s)]
*  And when I went to see it, apparently people are upset at my reaction to it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=390.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=393.0s)]
*  Because you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=394.0s)]
*  Because I was genuinely surprised that anyone would be upset at the movie. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=395.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=397.0s)]
*  Because it's just what they're mad about is talking about the patriarchy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=398.0s)]
*  But first of all, it's a fucking parody movie. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=401.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=403.0s)]
*  It's a movie about a doll who comes to life. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=404.0s)]
*  And you have a doll who lives in that world where the doll is the most important thing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=406.0s)]
*  It's all about Barbie and Barbie's world. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=411.0s)]
*  Of course, the men would be superficial. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=413.0s)]
*  Ken is superficial. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=415.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=416.0s)]
*  That's the plot. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=417.0s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=418.0s)]
*  How else are you going to make a Barbie movie where Barbie comes to life? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=419.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a great juxtaposition. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=422.0s)]
*  Like, seeing the difference between the world of living human beings where men are running everything [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=424.0s)]
*  and the world of Barbie world where the Barbies are the Supreme Court [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=429.0s)]
*  and they all wear bikinis on the Supreme Court. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=432.0s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=434.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=435.0s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=436.0s)]
*  It's a funny movie, man. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=437.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=438.0s)]
*  It's like I just don't understand why people would get so upset at this movie that's just not made for them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=439.0s)]
*  Well, because it's how they, you said it, it's how you make money. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=444.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=447.0s)]
*  So that's how you make money. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=448.0s)]
*  But it's like this culture war aspect of it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=449.0s)]
*  It's like, come on, people. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=450.0s)]
*  Well, there's, I think, an idea that, you know, that everything that's out right now, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=452.0s)]
*  there's political implications to everything. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=457.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=459.0s)]
*  And that's kind of exhausting, right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=460.0s)]
*  It's tiring, right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=462.0s)]
*  Figuring out if your yogurt is woke. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=463.0s)]
*  Like going through your grocery, going, opening your refrigerator and going, what's woke? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=466.0s)]
*  Is the mustard woke? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=471.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=473.0s)]
*  I think people are a little sick of it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=474.0s)]
*  And I think it's a little, first of all, all the food's poison. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=476.0s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=479.0s)]
*  That should make more sense. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=480.0s)]
*  It should be the barbecue sauce is liquid sugar poison, not does it want trans people, you know, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=482.0s)]
*  to fucking take their tits out at the White House. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=489.0s)]
*  It's food and it shouldn't, you know, but it's a level of wild that, you know, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=492.0s)]
*  I don't think people were prepared for. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=497.0s)]
*  I think Bud Light made a little bit of a mess, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=498.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=501.0s)]
*  Put Dylan Mulvaney out there. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=502.0s)]
*  And then I think people, you know, were kind of like, hey, what's going on? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=504.0s)]
*  And then it just became a firestorm. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=508.0s)]
*  And then like everything else is like contagion. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=510.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=512.0s)]
*  So it spreads now. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=513.0s)]
*  And now it's like, well, what is Chick-fil-A doing? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=514.0s)]
*  Are they doing stuff that they shouldn't be doing? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=517.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=519.0s)]
*  It's kind of, it's just getting tiring. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=520.0s)]
*  Conservatives are trying to find fake conservatives. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=522.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=525.0s)]
*  Like they're engaging in the same sort of behavior that they accuse liberals doing, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=526.0s)]
*  of these liberal witch hunts. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=530.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=531.0s)]
*  They're doing it with conservatives. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=532.0s)]
*  Like you could never be woke enough. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=533.0s)]
*  You could never be conservative enough. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=534.0s)]
*  Some of them like want to call people closet, like closet liberals, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=536.0s)]
*  or you know that term, rhino. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=539.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=540.0s)]
*  Republican in name only. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=541.0s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=542.0s)]
*  It's really, the tribal war between human beings that seemingly will always exist. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=543.0s)]
*  It'll never end. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=549.0s)]
*  It's so fascinating how that mindset just takes new forms, you know, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=550.0s)]
*  and has the same behavior, the thing that it hated decades earlier, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=555.0s)]
*  like on the left, like this want for war in Ukraine, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=560.0s)]
*  this trust in the military industrial complex in Ukraine. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=564.0s)]
*  What happened to you guys? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=567.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=568.0s)]
*  You guys are a totally different thing. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=569.0s)]
*  Like no one's discussing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=571.0s)]
*  Every argument made against, rightly, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=573.0s)]
*  like what's the plan? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=577.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=579.0s)]
*  We're going to be in a quagmire. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=580.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=581.0s)]
*  You know, the money would be better used at home. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=582.0s)]
*  All of those arguments were used, you know, at nauseam by people on the left, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=583.0s)]
*  and they were right. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=588.0s)]
*  And now if you bring up any of those arguments about the Ukraine, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=589.0s)]
*  you're called heartless. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=592.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=593.0s)]
*  You're called a Putin apologist. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=594.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=595.0s)]
*  So it's weird. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=596.0s)]
*  And the best take on it was Trump. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=597.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=599.0s)]
*  When he was doing that, what is her name? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=600.0s)]
*  Caitlin Collins? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=601.0s)]
*  Is that what her name is? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=602.0s)]
*  The journalist that was asking him, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=603.0s)]
*  and she was kind of like trying to say it in a gotcha way. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=605.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=608.0s)]
*  Who do you want to win? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=609.0s)]
*  Do you want Ukraine to win this war? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=610.0s)]
*  And he said, I just want people to stop dying. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=611.0s)]
*  And that is somehow controversial. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=614.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=617.0s)]
*  And that's because it's coming from him. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=618.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=619.0s)]
*  Anything that he says, no matter how logical it is, people are going to attack. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=620.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=625.0s)]
*  And that was a very logical statement. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=626.0s)]
*  I just want people to stop dying. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=628.0s)]
*  By the way, that's the appropriate response to truly really every war out there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=629.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=634.0s)]
*  Is that there's been no war that really hasn't been won with some type of agreement, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=635.0s)]
*  treaty compromise. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=639.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=640.0s)]
*  Most wars have some type of end game where you can go, OK, we've got to split up territory. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=641.0s)]
*  We've got to start a provisional government, whatever it is. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=648.0s)]
*  Now, this might be more difficult to do that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=651.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, unending conflict only hurts the people in those countries fighting the wars and becoming victims of the wars. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=653.0s)]
*  They don't hurt the people here making a lot of money. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=663.0s)]
*  It's just so sketchy whenever money gets involved. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=667.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=670.0s)]
*  Whenever you're realizing that people have an incentive to keep this rolling to the tune of who knows how many billions of dollars so far. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=671.0s)]
*  How much has been spent on that war so far? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=678.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=680.0s)]
*  I mean, it's over a trillion, probably. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=681.0s)]
*  You know, we spent a lot of money. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=682.0s)]
*  Well, what got me interested, what was why I started to read about it and, you know, was like overnight, overnight, the worst people in the world were were absolutely. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=683.0s)]
*  In love with the Ukraine, like the people that, you know, again, the pro Iraq war, pro Guantanamo Bay, pro torture, pro preemptive war. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=695.0s)]
*  They all were like very much across the board. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=706.0s)]
*  The idea that we have to support the Ukraine for as long as it takes and give them whatever it takes. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=710.0s)]
*  And I felt like that was crazy because we've seen that in the past. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=716.0s)]
*  You bite us in the ass a lot of different places and they all I mean, these are like the worst people in the world. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=722.0s)]
*  The people at Beverly Hills who are like make valets cry were like, get my fucking car. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=728.0s)]
*  Like those people, they all had Ukrainian flags on the outside of their house, but they didn't care about Yemen. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=732.0s)]
*  They don't care about what goes on in the Middle East in terms of like the Palestinians or, you know, what's happening over there. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=738.0s)]
*  They don't care about a lot of issues and a lot of places. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=746.0s)]
*  But they seem to really believe that we had to arm the Ukraine and engage in kind of this proxy war with Russia for an unending period of time, no matter how dangerous it got. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=749.0s)]
*  And Russia is a country with a lot of nuclear weapons. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=764.0s)]
*  So, I mean, what is the American national interest in the continued in that continued policy? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=767.0s)]
*  I don't know. Go to any city in America. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=773.0s)]
*  Right. And you see a lot of problems, homelessness, drug addiction, all of the money we're sending to the Ukraine probably could be used here. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=775.0s)]
*  Right. And there was a long period where everybody knew that there should be something done to clean up the places that got hit by the riots, to deal with some of the homeless encampments. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=782.0s)]
*  There should be a way where reasonable people can come to some solution. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=794.0s)]
*  We need funding to fix these things. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=799.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=801.0s)]
*  But the fact that just all of a sudden have trillions of dollars for this. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=802.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=807.0s)]
*  It's like where was all that money? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=808.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=810.0s)]
*  What about investing in cities? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=811.0s)]
*  Well, in the beginning it was we want peace and Ukraine was invaded by Russia. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=812.0s)]
*  And I understand supporting Ukraine to a degree. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=816.0s)]
*  But now we're talking about the only acceptable outcome is regime change in Russia. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=819.0s)]
*  Right. And then there was this guy, this hot dog warlord, this guy who sold hot dogs and then was chopping people's heads off. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=824.0s)]
*  OK, he did this like fake coup that didn't work. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=831.0s)]
*  And everybody in our media was like, he's going to be great. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=834.0s)]
*  Let's get rid of Putin, who, you know, his problems, his faults, notwithstanding, and he's a murderer. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=837.0s)]
*  He's done crazy things. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=842.0s)]
*  But we've lived with him for 20 years in relative peace, meaning like, yeah, we've never had a war with him. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=844.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=849.0s)]
*  He's done things in his region, but he was a first leader after 9-11 to cause and say, you know, like, hey, I'm sorry about that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=850.0s)]
*  Whatever the case may be, we were ready to just get rid of him and throwing a dude who hours before was lobbing people's heads off in the street. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=856.0s)]
*  So that to me is like you start looking at foreign policy going, does anyone care about anything? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=867.0s)]
*  Like, to anybody like this guy's a mass murderer. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=873.0s)]
*  He's running the Wagner Group, which is like, you know, this group of like prisoners, ex-prisoners that he recruited from Soviet prisons, from Russian prison. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=876.0s)]
*  And these are like murderers and rapists. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=887.0s)]
*  He's going, let's go to the Ukraine and kill everybody. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=889.0s)]
*  And then everybody's like, no, he's he'd be great. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=891.0s)]
*  Doesn't make it doesn't make too much sense to me. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=897.0s)]
*  And then that doesn't happen. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=900.0s)]
*  Doesn't happen. And everyone goes, but the crazy thing is that it's been adopted wholesale by the left. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=901.0s)]
*  Yes. People that are always the most skeptical about war. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=907.0s)]
*  Well, were. But I mean, if you look at a lot of wars, I guess in history, a lot of them have been started by Democrats. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=910.0s)]
*  It seems like the party in power likes war. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=915.0s)]
*  Seems like if you're the party in power in this country, you do like a war with the exception of Trump. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=918.0s)]
*  And I know people get mad when I say this, but Trump wasn't in a ton of wars. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=925.0s)]
*  He did do some drone strikes. He did things. But, you know, the party in power died like a dog. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=928.0s)]
*  Right. Right. The party in power, they seem to like war. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=933.0s)]
*  And I get it. I would too. I would too, because it gives you something to talk about and do. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=936.0s)]
*  Well, Trump was the first guy that I ever saw who was a sitting president who openly admitted that the military industrial complex wants you to go to war. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=941.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like when Eisenhower was resigning, he said it. But Trump actually said that he said it in an interview. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=949.0s)]
*  I think it was with Steve Hilton on Fox, which is just a wild thing to hear that they might be influenced, more inclined to get that not not wars when they're necessary, but like wars that they can justify for financial reasons. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=955.0s)]
*  And let's say we should treat the people that serve the military with the respect of being honest with them about what their mission is. Right. And why they're somewhere. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=970.0s)]
*  You know, if you don't make the ultimate sacrifice for America, you're going to be make that sacrifice. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=978.0s)]
*  You're going to put yourself in harm's way. You might die. You have a family and kids. They're not getting paid millions of dollars. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=983.0s)]
*  We're not making them famous. They're not. You know what I mean? Like, you know, we should treat them with the respect of like the things they do should be vital and necessary for our security. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=989.0s)]
*  They shouldn't just be out there making people money. Right. Exactly. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1002.0s)]
*  Which is why when I run the governor, when I run for governor of California, which I should, you probably win. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1007.0s)]
*  I actually thought about it, you know, maybe not seriously, but, you know, maybe I said, why not? Why not? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1013.0s)]
*  You would really get a lot of votes. There's something about it because you were serious about it. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1021.0s)]
*  I might be serious about it because like I, I, the only thing that's going to be against me is the hours and hours I have of me talking. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1026.0s)]
*  That's going to be tough because people are going to be able to isolate. Sure. Lots of things I've said and they've got, they're going to go, hey, this is crazy. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1034.0s)]
*  But don't you think I also might get bored with the job in a week and quit. That's the problem. That's the problem. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1042.0s)]
*  I might just, I might just book like a comedy club in Des Moines. Yeah, it's nowhere good. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1047.0s)]
*  And I might just leave and go, this is kind of boring because I don't think, you know, I don't know governing running seems great. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1053.0s)]
*  Winning is great. Governing seems terrible. It doesn't seem like it's totally doable. That's right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1059.0s)]
*  It seems like whatever changes you think. First of all, imagine you're a guy or a gal or a non-binary person just becomes president. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1068.0s)]
*  You have to run in and fix all of the chaos. You have to deal with everything involving foreign policy. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1076.0s)]
*  You're responsible for everything involving infrastructure, transportation, anything financial. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1084.0s)]
*  You're responsible for all the failures. You get very little credit for the success. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1090.0s)]
*  They'll just name the innovators in each field that did this. And it is a thankless job. And that's why they steal. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1095.0s)]
*  That is why they steal. You got to give it to them. The reason Pelosi and them steal is because she's like, listen, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1102.0s)]
*  you motherfuckers didn't care about the student lunch program we did. No one reported on that. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1109.0s)]
*  So the reality is we're going to have to take a little off the top. You think that's what it is? That's probably what it is. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1114.0s)]
*  I think they just get used to that job. That grift. Yeah. I think people and I think that's how people who are relatively good people become politicians and get tainted by it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1119.0s)]
*  I think when you get inside the machine and you realize that influence has a massive effect on all sorts of decisions that get made [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1129.0s)]
*  and that there's some sort of weird loophole that allows you to know about laws that are going to be passed in advance and then buy stock and accordingly, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1137.0s)]
*  in accordance, rather, to what you know. And it's not insider trading. It's not illegal. It should be. And they all do it. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1144.0s)]
*  If you look at the right and left, they're all doing it. It's got to suck to be the guy who goes to Washington who doesn't do it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1152.0s)]
*  You got to suck so much. If you get there and you're from some shit state, Delaware, something, and you get there and you're going to ruin the party, you're going to blow the whistle. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1159.0s)]
*  Everybody's like, dude, this is how we make our money. And you're the guy fucking that up. That's got to be a lot of pressure. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1170.0s)]
*  They would kill you. It's like the New York City cops. That's right. Yeah. It's like that movie, The Seven Five. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1177.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, first day on the job, he sees a guy get thrown out of a window. He's like, he jumped, right? And they're like, yeah, definitely jumped. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1182.0s)]
*  You guys just killed somebody. Yeah. Yeah. I guess there's so much pressure because you don't want to be on the outs with everybody. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1188.0s)]
*  Yeah. Especially when you are involved in this business. It's very competitive. Right? You're getting elected all the time. You're competing with other people. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1196.0s)]
*  You're trying to get your name out there and you and you're you're in this world where all these people that are in this world are doing this thing. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1204.0s)]
*  You're going to do that thing too. Probably you'd have to be like, well, you'd have to be very vocal against it. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1211.0s)]
*  And that would be a real problem. Bernie Sanders who like gets nothing done. People just like him. Yeah, he's liked, but he gets nothing done. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1216.0s)]
*  He's from Vermont. He's like, you know, I'm cool. I believe in shit. Everybody's like, good for you. And then nothing happened. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1224.0s)]
*  I think it would have been an interesting one term president. Yeah, it would have been very, very interesting. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1233.0s)]
*  It would have been very interesting if there was no shenanigans. Right. If the DNC didn't rig the primaries. Right. Because they kind of did. Right. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1238.0s)]
*  I don't know how they did it, but this is something that what's that woman's name who wrote that book? Donna Brazil. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1246.0s)]
*  Brazil. Donna Brazil. Yeah, she talked about it and she talked about being terrified after Seth Rich got murdered. Right. You know, she was terrified for her own life. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1255.0s)]
*  Sure. I mean, right. Look, look, people like just random violence. House of Cards. Not murder. Yeah. But random violence is common in D.C. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1266.0s)]
*  Right. But also that probably wasn't probably wasn't random. And that House of Cards, if you rewatch it, I rewatched it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1275.0s)]
*  It is probably pretty close to the way things happen. I mean, listen, do they make it fun to watch? Absolutely. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1282.0s)]
*  I get it. But when everybody's being blackmailed and controlled and people disappear and die. Yeah, that probably is close to the way it works. Probably real close. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1290.0s)]
*  Probably real close. Yeah. But then you think how else could it work? Right. Like it's weird to envision. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1301.0s)]
*  It's almost weirder to think of it not working like that in a weird way, not to be too cynical about it, but like like just imagining people showing up and like good faith debating each other and being like, well, I see your point. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1308.0s)]
*  And well, I have a point like it feels like that's a total fantasy. That would be great. And I'd love that to happen. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1321.0s)]
*  That feels more of a fantasy than House of Cards where they're like, oh, you don't want to vote on that bill. Take a look at that envelope. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1328.0s)]
*  And it's just some you and some chick you're fucking walking out of a restaurant. That seems to be more the way it happens. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1334.0s)]
*  Definitely more the way it happened in the past. Right. And we know that. So probably more likely it happens like that now. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1341.0s)]
*  Imagine being in any other business where when your friend drowns in front of your house, everybody's like, right. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1348.0s)]
*  Any other business like if you're a comic, like if you came over my house and drowned, right, no one would think I killed you. No one would just think you drowned. Absolutely. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1359.0s)]
*  But if you're a politician, if I was a president, people would be very not shocked if I drowned. It would be it would be a very like believable. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1368.0s)]
*  You could drown me and there would be marks around my neck. They'd be like, that fat idiot fell, choked himself and died. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1377.0s)]
*  Like it would be easy. Right. Yeah. Any of our friends, for the most part, not all of them, pretty much everybody except for Alex Jones. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1384.0s)]
*  Most people we know could die and it would be a very believable story. Yes. Just some dumb thing they did or. Sure. Yeah, it does happen. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1392.0s)]
*  But when a chef is on a pond outside of your house, by the way, when you're not there, like you're letting the chef use your estate when you're not there. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1401.0s)]
*  Doesn't that seem weird that the Obamas were like, oh, no, no, no, you go, you go use it. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1412.0s)]
*  He had that eleven million dollar house we have in Martin's Vineyard. You use it. Doesn't that seem odd? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1417.0s)]
*  Well, if the house is that big, though, it probably has a guest house. If they were there, it makes sense. He's cooking for them. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1422.0s)]
*  But what weren't they on the island? I don't know. But I think they're saying they were on the island. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1430.0s)]
*  The problem is we can't have access to the recordings, the 9-11 calls, because you'll hear satanic sounds in the background. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1436.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. You hear screams. There's weird stuff with the police log with that where they didn't. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1445.0s)]
*  Gongs. They didn't fill it out immediately. Oh, really? Yeah. I mean, there's shady stuff. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1452.0s)]
*  But listen, here's the reality. If you're the Obamas and you can't kill someone you want, what is the point? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1460.0s)]
*  Literally, what is the point? But imagine if you're the Obamas and your friend just fucking drowns. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1466.0s)]
*  Yes. I mean, and you didn't have anything to do with it. Maybe he had a reaction to some medication that you gave him. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1472.0s)]
*  Or maybe it's some medication that a lot of people took. And he has a heart attack. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1480.0s)]
*  A lot of people near these people die. That's my only thing. Yeah. Like if you're like a dog walker for the Clintons or you're like a shat. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1485.0s)]
*  Like if you're near either the Bush family, the Clinton family, a lot of these families, the people that are with them, their Secret Service agents, they have accidents. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1494.0s)]
*  They hear a lot of stuff. They overhear stuff. They're party to things. They see things. And then a lot of them just, you know, they have accidents. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1502.0s)]
*  Yeah. Whoopsies. Bye. Whoops. Sorry. All of a sudden the guy's hanging from an extension cord and shoots himself in the chest with a shotgun. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1510.0s)]
*  That seems, you know, unlikely. Where'd they find the shotgun? How far away did they find it from his body? Some very unusual distance. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1518.0s)]
*  I'd be so disappointed if we find out none of it's true. Oh, yeah. I would be so disappointed if we find out that all of them died of natural causes. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1526.0s)]
*  I would be so disappointed when would this like 50 people that have died under suspicious circumstances? Right. At least one of them. Right. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1536.0s)]
*  Says the 12 gauge shotgun was 30 feet from his body when he was found dead. Right. Well, he shot himself and then threw it 30 feet is very far. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1545.0s)]
*  That could be that. Here's the thing. If you are actually holding a shotgun and shooting it in your chest, there's not going to be any resistance on the other end. Right. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1555.0s)]
*  So it's essentially like a rocket. So it's not because of the way you would have to do it. Yeah. Shoot yourself in the chest with a shotgun. Right. It's possible. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1566.0s)]
*  It is. Yeah, it's possible that it would go flying and then it would fly out. Yeah. Interesting. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1575.0s)]
*  So maybe he was just super troubled. And that is what he did. You just got to think about if you're at that. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1580.0s)]
*  If you occupy that level of society and somebody's threatening you, how do you deal with it? If you have the, you know, whatever you want to call it, the ambition, the ruthless to get there. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1585.0s)]
*  And somebody's trying to take that from you. Yeah. What do you do? How do you handle it? You try to be like black in their name in the press. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1598.0s)]
*  You try to besmirch them. And if that doesn't work, what do you do? Do you just say, okay, I guess we're just going to get taken down by a scandal. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1605.0s)]
*  Or do you just say, hey, we got to take care of this? I think it really depends on who you are and what kind of accents to people you have. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1612.0s)]
*  You know, I can't imagine anybody getting to that level of society. Right. And letting themselves get taken down by someone far below them. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1622.0s)]
*  Usually when those families get taken out, they're taken out by like an equal, someone at their level. Right. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1634.0s)]
*  But when someone far below you that you could get rid of or, you know, it's like that guy outside of that restaurant in L.A., Austria Mozart and Melrose and Highland whose car just went into a. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1640.0s)]
*  Yeah. Things like that happen. And of course, yeah, maybe he was drunk and just decided to go 150 miles an hour. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1653.0s)]
*  I'm talking about that journalist. Michael Hastings. Yeah. Things like that happen. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1658.0s)]
*  And they're weird. And you say to yourself like, did you piss the wrong person off? And he certainly did. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1661.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then how do people at that level deal with it? It makes a lot of sense to me that people like that would use violence to deal with their enemies. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1668.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, to silence their enemies forever. Like that makes sense to me. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1681.0s)]
*  But maybe I'm too cynical and maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1686.0s)]
*  But it would make a lot of sense to me that they would there'd be a meeting. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1691.0s)]
*  The people would meet and they'd go, yeah, we got to take care of this. We can't allow this to become a thing. Yeah. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1697.0s)]
*  You know, and that's how they've done it throughout history. Right. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1705.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what they did when they got rid of JFK. That's what Lizzo should have done with those bitches. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1708.0s)]
*  But those bitches who turned on her because she was trying to help them. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1713.0s)]
*  First of all, that that's not even a car. Like, you don't get to be a fat backup dancer. That doesn't exist. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1719.0s)]
*  It's not real. Lizzo made that category of person. She made it. And then they turned on her. That's crazy. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1725.0s)]
*  She made it. What is she accused of? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1732.0s)]
*  Fat shaming them, making them rehearse, making them stand up. That's what their version of fat shaming is. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1735.0s)]
*  Making them stand up and walk onto the stage, making them rehearse, taking them to a sex club in Amsterdam where the performers are shooting bananas out of their pussies because this is what happens. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1741.0s)]
*  And Lizzo is like forcing them to touch the nude performers and force one of them to eat a banana that came out of the vagina of a sex worker performer dancer in the sex club. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1755.0s)]
*  Lizzo makes a girl. She's like, eat the banana, eat the banana. And then the girl gets really angry at that. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1767.0s)]
*  But supposedly Lizzo was just abusing her power. This is what they're all saying. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1773.0s)]
*  But I don't know if I buy that. I think it's bitter people maybe that are angry because they all look like Lizzo. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1780.0s)]
*  This is what's going to drive them nuts. They look exactly like her and she's worth 40 million and they're probably getting paid shit. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1789.0s)]
*  So they're in the background every night dancing and it ain't easy. It's fun to be on that TV show that she had. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1797.0s)]
*  But then you have to do it every night. They're icing their joints. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1804.0s)]
*  You know it's hard. They're in the trailer. It's fucking tough. Lizzo had to start getting on some of them going like, you got to tone it down. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1809.0s)]
*  You know, it's becoming a problem. You know, the weight is becoming a problem. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1818.0s)]
*  And then Lizzo's response was she's like, I would never fire any of them because of their weight. It's like, what a weird statement. They're dancers. How fat can they get? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1823.0s)]
*  How fucking big can they get? If I wanted to be a dancer for Taylor Swift and she came up to me and went, you're too fat to do this. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1832.0s)]
*  I'd go, that makes sense. And I'd leave with some dignity. But these women, Lizzo has them on stage. She has them dancing. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1839.0s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you know, she's abusing or making them do weird shit. And they all are now suing her. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1847.0s)]
*  And her streaming has slowed down big time. The ads, you know how it is. It's a big cancellation. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1855.0s)]
*  So did she, so this show, were these girls dancers before they got on her show? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1861.0s)]
*  No, because you can't be a dancer at a certain, let's just be very honest here. They're not at the ballet. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1867.0s)]
*  You know how the ballerinas are on the tippy toes? That's not happening. These women, it's a fetish dancing. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1876.0s)]
*  These are larger women. And I don't mean like, oh I had a cheesecake. I mean like, these are big, big, big ladies. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1883.0s)]
*  And they're dancing because Lizzo's whole thing. Lizzo's like, I'm not getting enough attention just being the fatty up front. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1891.0s)]
*  I want everyone on stage to be fat. So I can get more praise. Because the media will be like, not only is she fat, everyone's fat. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1897.0s)]
*  The whole stage looks like shit. How good of a person is she? That's what they want. I think that's what she wanted. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1905.0s)]
*  She wanted, it wasn't enough that it was her, it had to be everybody. And that's what bit her in the ass. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1911.0s)]
*  But the question was, these gals, how often did they have to dance? Was it like every night? How often was that show? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1916.0s)]
*  Was it a once a week show? What was it? I don't know. But they were on tour. So you'd figure when you're on a, they were on tour. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1925.0s)]
*  Okay, so they're doing regular shows. Regular shows. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1931.0s)]
*  Now, this is my question. When you're a big girl and you're not exercising, then all of a sudden someone hires you for a dance show because they want big girls. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1934.0s)]
*  And then you have to do that kind of shit every day. It's tough. Your body's not prepared for that. Your joints are weak. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1943.0s)]
*  Very hard. You could get really fucked up doing, it's like asking someone to go into some crazy cardiovascular workout. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1950.0s)]
*  Right. And they get mad at Lizzo because Lizzo doesn't have to do anything, she just pulls out the flute. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1958.0s)]
*  Can I see what it looked like? Can you show me what that show was like? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1962.0s)]
*  Can you show us the big girls? Here come the big girls is the show. But I think they're also angry at Lizzo because they're like, we're dancing and rehearsing, she doesn't have to rehearse. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1966.0s)]
*  Lizzo just kind of walks out on stage and sings her songs and does a little, but then pulls out the flute. These girls have to like dance through the whole thing. So it's difficult. It's hard. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1974.0s)]
*  It sounds hard. It's not easy. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1985.0s)]
*  Here's the TV show. It's hard for a dancer. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1987.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1990.0s)]
*  Okay, so there's Lizzo. It's on Amazon Prime Video. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=1993.0s)]
*  You could tell how badly this was going to go by the way. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2020.0s)]
*  You're beautiful the way you are. I need to challenge myself and step outside my comfort zone. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2050.0s)]
*  Now I'm going into competition. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2054.0s)]
*  Some people are not at the same level that I am. I'm gonna call you Lil' Sis. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2056.0s)]
*  She's trying to demean me. She's not understanding how to read the room. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2060.0s)]
*  You might not make it into the show. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2064.0s)]
*  I see a lot of... [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2068.0s)]
*  Right. So what was that one that we just passed through? There was one that like, was that a transgender person? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2069.0s)]
*  Yes, I believe that is a transgender person. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2075.0s)]
*  Yeah, even in like a quick glance. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2077.0s)]
*  Yes, it was a quick... I'll say they didn't do a great job at fully going to the other gender there. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2079.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? They kind of stopped. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2088.0s)]
*  And that's fine. Not everyone does a great job all the time at everything. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2091.0s)]
*  I brought my car in to get washed and it comes out and you go, meh. And that's kind of what that was. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2094.0s)]
*  So the show is basically she's hiring these girls. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2099.0s)]
*  These girls? Listen. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2103.0s)]
*  And then they're going on tour together. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2105.0s)]
*  I've had drug addictions. I've had eating things. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2106.0s)]
*  When you are not in a good mental state, which is a lot of the reason people act out with different things, right? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2110.0s)]
*  With substances, with food, with whatever. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2117.0s)]
*  Listen, if you have people that are emotionally, that have issues, and Lizzo might have them as well, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2120.0s)]
*  it's a toxic soup of maybe that becomes a problem on tour. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2128.0s)]
*  Everybody... the idea of a judge having to adjudicate this to me is the funniest thing I've ever... [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2134.0s)]
*  the idea of a judge in a room having to go who called who fat, looking Lizzo's on one side and then the dance, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2141.0s)]
*  and he's like staring at everybody going, wait, who's who? Who's what? Who's fat? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2146.0s)]
*  Like it's crazy, but it's unfortunate because they're coming for her career. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2151.0s)]
*  They're coming for her career big time. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2156.0s)]
*  The show itself seems like it would be a health risk. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2159.0s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2164.0s)]
*  It seems like it would be, right? To force people to work out. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2165.0s)]
*  Part of the lawsuit has to do with the recording that one of the dancers made, and I'm reading this article. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2168.0s)]
*  This sounds... it's interesting. If you guys would want to read it, that's pretty fun. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2173.0s)]
*  The suit also describes an alleged meeting with dancers on April 27th at which Lizzo repeatedly referenced William's termination, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2177.0s)]
*  allegedly telling her that she had, quote, eyes and ears everywhere. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2184.0s)]
*  Davis recorded this meeting because she suffers from an eye condition that can make her, quote, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2187.0s)]
*  disoriented in stressful situations, according to the suit. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2191.0s)]
*  Days later, Lizzo allegedly held an emergency meeting where she discovered that the previous meeting had been recorded, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2195.0s)]
*  the suit says. She became furious, hurling expletives at the group and stating that she was going to go around the room [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2201.0s)]
*  person by person until somebody told Lizzo who made the recording, according to the lawsuit. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2206.0s)]
*  The suit says Davis confirmed that she had recorded the meeting, allegedly told Lizzo that she had meant any harm, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2211.0s)]
*  and had deleted the video. Lizzo allegedly responded, there is nothing you can say to make me believe you. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2216.0s)]
*  So it's kind of like mafia shit. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2222.0s)]
*  All right. Well, someone did... here's what I want to know. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2224.0s)]
*  When it says, became furious, hurling expletives at the group and stated that she was going to go around the room person by person [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2228.0s)]
*  until someone told Lizzo who was making... who made the recording. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2234.0s)]
*  God, I hope she refers to herself in the third term. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2238.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2241.0s)]
*  Third person. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2242.0s)]
*  Somebody better tell Lizzo. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2243.0s)]
*  I hope that's how she says it. That would be amazing. If she said someone better tell Lizzo. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2244.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, she brought all these women on tour probably to abuse them, you know? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2250.0s)]
*  I don't think they thought it through. That's what I'm saying. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2255.0s)]
*  When you have a bunch of fatty boom baddies on the tour, she's probably having a little fun going, girls, you know, she's probably... [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2258.0s)]
*  Eat some pussy out of banana. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2268.0s)]
*  Eat the pussy banana. And also, bitch, do it because where else are you going to dance? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2270.0s)]
*  You're not getting hired anywhere else. Like, unfortunately or fortunately, you're not working. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2275.0s)]
*  So you were given this really weird, unique opportunity that only exists with this one woman. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2281.0s)]
*  It doesn't exist anywhere else. So, you know. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2288.0s)]
*  This is like not to body shame anybody, but there's been a weird shift. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2292.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2297.0s)]
*  And just the way society looks at these things. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2298.0s)]
*  Because it used to be that women that were representing clothes and things had ideal shapes. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2300.0s)]
*  Like that's what they used for advertisement. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2309.0s)]
*  And then something changed and they decided to... [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2311.0s)]
*  Well, society used to really prioritize people who could breathe on their own. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2314.0s)]
*  And listen, as a person, I've struggled with my weight, but I know that if fat is not good, eating the wrong thing isn't good. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2320.0s)]
*  We shouldn't turn it into good. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2337.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2339.0s)]
*  It's crazy to turn it into good. That's a horrible idea. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2340.0s)]
*  There's people that could be encouraged in this exact same state. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2344.0s)]
*  They could either be encouraged that you're perfect on your own and don't you worry about anything. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2349.0s)]
*  And don't you even worry about what food is. Just eat to your heart's content. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2355.0s)]
*  Right. Well, there were things that LA... [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2359.0s)]
*  They put this weird story out where it was like the LA school district was like, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2361.0s)]
*  let's stop telling kids that fruits and vegetables are good and junk food is bad because the reality is that's racist. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2365.0s)]
*  I don't know how. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2371.0s)]
*  I don't know how either. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2372.0s)]
*  But they were like, yeah, they were like, it's racist. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2373.0s)]
*  If you tell a kid there's a difference between an Oreo and an orange that is racist. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2375.0s)]
*  Recently, they had a thing where Lizzo lost a few pounds. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2380.0s)]
*  I don't know how, but she did. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2384.0s)]
*  You know, she moves around a lot, so she shaved a couple off, maybe lost a little bit in the face. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2386.0s)]
*  Don't know how it happened. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2390.0s)]
*  They started attacking her. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2392.0s)]
*  The fat activist people started saying, how dare you? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2394.0s)]
*  You're losing weight. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2398.0s)]
*  You're the symbol of fat. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2399.0s)]
*  And she should never have let them put that crown on her. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2400.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2403.0s)]
*  When they said she should have said, hey, I'm an artist. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2404.0s)]
*  I'm a singer. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2406.0s)]
*  This is what I do. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2407.0s)]
*  Not I'm the symbol of all fat people. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2408.0s)]
*  Because now you own them. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2410.0s)]
*  Now you own the fatties. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2412.0s)]
*  And you have to stay fat. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2414.0s)]
*  And you got to stay fat. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2416.0s)]
*  And like, so Lizzo loses a few pounds. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2417.0s)]
*  And then people started attacking her going, how dare you lose the weight? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2419.0s)]
*  And Lizzo literally made a statement. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2424.0s)]
*  She said, I move around a lot for my job. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2426.0s)]
*  I mean, look at how insane this world is. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2429.0s)]
*  Lizzo goes, I move around a lot for my job. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2430.0s)]
*  I lost a little bit of weight. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2433.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to be thin. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2434.0s)]
*  I don't even want to be thin. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2436.0s)]
*  This was an accident. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2437.0s)]
*  To keep this rapid fan base of crazy people. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2439.0s)]
*  My health was an accident. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2446.0s)]
*  My health was an accident. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2447.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2449.0s)]
*  I didn't mean to improve. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2450.0s)]
*  It won't happen again. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2451.0s)]
*  So it's, we've gone so far. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2453.0s)]
*  Can I just tell you? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2455.0s)]
*  Kevin James had a manager that told him once, when you're losing weight, you're losing roles. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2456.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2460.0s)]
*  Well, if you're an actor and you're used to that certain thing, you know, people got to get used to you another way, whatever. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2461.0s)]
*  But like, you got to remember with somebody like Lizzo, right, you couldn't lose a lot of weight. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2467.0s)]
*  You're still a problem. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2472.0s)]
*  Like, that's the whole thing. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2474.0s)]
*  It's like, she could lose a lot of weight and it's still like, it's such a luxury concern when people are like, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2476.0s)]
*  well, how's the world going to relate to me with a six pack? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2484.0s)]
*  It's like, just stand up by yourself first and then get to there. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2487.0s)]
*  But it's crazy. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2493.0s)]
*  We've shifted the goalpost. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2495.0s)]
*  Like, let's not abuse people. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2496.0s)]
*  Let's not be nasty to people, especially if you don't know them or if you know them, if they're your kids or your friends, it's completely appropriate to go, hey, what's going on here? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2498.0s)]
*  But if you don't know people shitting on them on the Internet or whatever, that's a shitty thing to do. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2506.0s)]
*  But saying that there's no difference health wise between the big girls on that show and then thinner dancers is crazy. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2512.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2520.0s)]
*  And we can't live in a world where we remove all sense of reality. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2521.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2527.0s)]
*  Because then it's like the only fun of eating a cupcake or a little scoop of ice cream is knowing it's bad. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2528.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2534.0s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2535.0s)]
*  Not because it's good. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2537.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2539.0s)]
*  When you eat a little something you shouldn't eat, you go, I did the wrong thing. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2540.0s)]
*  I'm a bad boy. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2543.0s)]
*  And you should feel ashamed a little bit. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2544.0s)]
*  There should be a little shame there. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2546.0s)]
*  And it's worth the shame because it tastes so fucking good. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2548.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just worth the shame. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2551.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2553.0s)]
*  You know, if you've ever been, I walked out of a frozen yogurt shop once and someone recognized me. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2554.0s)]
*  I don't get recognized all the time, but somebody recognized you. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2559.0s)]
*  You should be ashamed of that. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2561.0s)]
*  If someone goes, hey, man, I like your stuff and you're holding frozen yogurt at 2 p.m., [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2563.0s)]
*  you should be ashamed of that. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2569.0s)]
*  That should be a shameful moment in your life. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2571.0s)]
*  You should be like, walking out of an ice cream shop in the mid-afternoon with Sam Talent in Austin, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2575.0s)]
*  walking out of Amy's Ice Cream with Sam Talent, and then somebody goes, oh, Tim Dillon. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2581.0s)]
*  And you go, you spin around, you look at it. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2585.0s)]
*  And it's two, and the only other people in the thing are children because it's a fucking ice cream shop. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2587.0s)]
*  The only people there are fucking kids. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2591.0s)]
*  They're nine years old, right? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2593.0s)]
*  And then these rich B-cave moms, there should be a moment where we go, oh, this isn't good. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2595.0s)]
*  This isn't right. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2600.0s)]
*  Divorcing yourself from that, that's when I think comedy gets weird. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2602.0s)]
*  That's when I think everything gets weird. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2606.0s)]
*  When you stop saying what is real or true to you, and when you start adopting this idea that up is down and down is up, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2608.0s)]
*  and it's just a matter of how you look at it, that's when everything starts to get crazy. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2618.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that's where we are. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2623.0s)]
*  That's kind of where we are. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2625.0s)]
*  There's a certain percentage of the population that is questioning everything right now. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2627.0s)]
*  I mean, mathematics, they're talking about mathematics being racist and subjective or somehow. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2631.0s)]
*  What was the argument? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2638.0s)]
*  I don't know, because it was designed, anything designed by white people, like I said, is inherently potentially. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2639.0s)]
*  You just gotta... [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2644.0s)]
*  So dumb. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2646.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, now it's important to like, local stuff's important now, right? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2647.0s)]
*  Like your family. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2652.0s)]
*  You can't really rely on institutions. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2653.0s)]
*  You can try to improve them, but the local stuff's important, like your family, your community, the values that people have, right? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2655.0s)]
*  And the schools you send your kids to, like the context you provide your kids now. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2662.0s)]
*  So when they come home and go, well, the teacher said this, and you go, yeah, yeah, yeah, but let me... [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2669.0s)]
*  You can't outsource it anymore and trust that your kids are going to get like a good education. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2673.0s)]
*  You have to get involved and go, okay, your teacher might have some points, but also there's also a whole other world here. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2679.0s)]
*  Like, I think I don't think we could send kids to school and have them go, like, no, your teachers write about everything, which I never believed. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2686.0s)]
*  I never believed that somebody driving a Toyota Camry was correct. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2695.0s)]
*  Well, you also have to think that those adults are with your children more than you are during the day. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2698.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2704.0s)]
*  They're there for hours and hours with the undivided attention of your kids. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2705.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2710.0s)]
*  And some of them are fucking loons. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2711.0s)]
*  Some of them are not. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2713.0s)]
*  And some of them think that they have a job to do to, like, remove the programming of the parents that they don't agree with. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2714.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2724.0s)]
*  So they could not agree with the parents and tell the kids that the parents are wrong and they're right, which is a real creepy thing. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2725.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2732.0s)]
*  I don't know who's right and who's wrong. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2733.0s)]
*  This is a made up scenario, right? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2735.0s)]
*  But just that someone would decide that they are right and the parents are wrong and they want to convince this child of something, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2737.0s)]
*  whether it's they have political leanings, whether it's their attitude on whatever the fuck it is. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2747.0s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2753.0s)]
*  If someone would get into your kids head and have some very questionable and debatable ideas that they're trying to push as doctrine. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2754.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2764.0s)]
*  And that does happen. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2765.0s)]
*  I've had some shitty fucking teachers that will just tell you, you know, tell you that they are right about certain things. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2766.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2772.0s)]
*  I used to do cocaine with the substitutes at my school. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2773.0s)]
*  And those were that was kind of the level of teacher we had. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2776.0s)]
*  But we had some great teachers. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2780.0s)]
*  And then we had some teachers that were not great. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2781.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2783.0s)]
*  You know, we all know those teachers, right? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2784.0s)]
*  We all know those teachers who had kind of an agenda. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2786.0s)]
*  Like they went in and they were like they were teachers because nobody would listen to them. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2790.0s)]
*  So now they had this captive audience and they were like, well, I'm going to talk. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2794.0s)]
*  We had a health teacher like that in, you know, high school that had like an agenda, not even like a sexuality agenda or whatever. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2797.0s)]
*  She would just complain about her own miserable life to us. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2805.0s)]
*  Like she would just tell us about her husband and everything like that. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2809.0s)]
*  She was going through a divorce. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2813.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2814.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, this woman just wants people to talk to. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2815.0s)]
*  And that's how she taught class. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2817.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2818.0s)]
*  She just would complain about like she had just gone through a divorce and, you know, like the husband. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2819.0s)]
*  What was the subject? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2824.0s)]
*  It was health. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2825.0s)]
*  It's like a fake class anyway. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2826.0s)]
*  And this bitch would just get up and like literally she said to one kid once she goes, you're like a really feminine kid. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2828.0s)]
*  He was like, well, if I get married, she goes, you're gay. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2834.0s)]
*  And then the class was like, what? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2837.0s)]
*  And then she's like, she goes and he goes, excuse me. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2840.0s)]
*  And she goes, no, you're gay. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2845.0s)]
*  And then just moved on. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2846.0s)]
*  Like she was wacky. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2848.0s)]
*  I think she ended up getting fired. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2849.0s)]
*  But she clearly used her classroom as like a thing, like a therapy session where she wasn't like going over. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2851.0s)]
*  You know, this was just like her. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2859.0s)]
*  I think that my grandmother was a teacher. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2861.0s)]
*  She was an amazing teacher. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2862.0s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think it's appropriate to like you can have opinions, obviously, as a teacher. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2865.0s)]
*  But like, you know, you got to understand that there's like certain things that but then there's overreaction to where I think they banned the book in Florida because it had two penguins that were dudes. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2871.0s)]
*  But it was like they weren't the penguins weren't fucking. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2881.0s)]
*  What? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2884.0s)]
*  They unbanned the book. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2885.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2886.0s)]
*  He gets a little wild. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2887.0s)]
*  Well, he's probably got some really wild people that are supporting him. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2888.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2891.0s)]
*  So he gets a little wild. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2892.0s)]
*  You get into those religious. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2893.0s)]
*  It gets a little cult like. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2894.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little cult. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2896.0s)]
*  But I'm all this as somebody who's been out of the closet for years and years and don't hide anything. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2898.0s)]
*  I don't think six year olds should be taught about any sexuality. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2903.0s)]
*  No, it has nothing to do with their lives. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2907.0s)]
*  Right. They should be taught reading math, the alphabet. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2909.0s)]
*  So anybody going like boys in this line, girls in this line, and this line is for my special people like out. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2912.0s)]
*  That's what I feel. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2920.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2921.0s)]
*  And that's what most gay people over a certain age feel. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2922.0s)]
*  It's like it's silly. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2925.0s)]
*  And Tango Makes Three recounts the true story of two male penguins who were devoted to each other at the Central Park Zoo in New York. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2926.0s)]
*  A zookeeper who saw them building a nest and trying to incubate an egg shaped rock gave them an egg from a different penguin pair with two eggs after they were having difficulty hatching more than one egg at a time. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2934.0s)]
*  The chick cared for by the male penguins was named Tango. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2944.0s)]
*  So male Tango had two gay dads. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2947.0s)]
*  Is that? Yeah, I'm trying to. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2951.0s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2952.0s)]
*  But they unbanned this, I think. They banned it and then unbanned. I don't know why they unbanned it. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2953.0s)]
*  It was the band was lifted because I guess it wasn't explicit. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2958.0s)]
*  What is wrong with gay penguins? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2962.0s)]
*  I don't know. But I think it's an overreaction because it's like. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2964.0s)]
*  But there were books where they were showing like explicit like oral sex. They were showing like illustrations of oral sex. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2967.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2974.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2975.0s)]
*  No, it's insane. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2976.0s)]
*  Talking about lust and wanting someone. It's like it's essentially a cartoon porn. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2977.0s)]
*  No, it's that's crazy. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2982.0s)]
*  And it's also crazy to introduce the concept of like gender theory to children. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2983.0s)]
*  It's not fair. It's not fair. It's crazy. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2988.0s)]
*  It's not fair because also kids are so fucking malleable, man. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2990.0s)]
*  They're malleable. And if they hear like, oh, there's boys and girls and then there's this. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2993.0s)]
*  If you're transgender, you'll know. You'll know. If you're gay, you'll know. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=2997.0s)]
*  There isn't like you don't need to be told that you're transgender or gay or lesbian, whatever. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3003.0s)]
*  You don't need to be told that by anybody. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3010.0s)]
*  Another thing that really scares me is there does not seem to be a lot of attention paid made to D transitioners. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3012.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3021.0s)]
*  You know, when you're celebrating this one thing, there's another side like you have a responsibility. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3022.0s)]
*  Except Ben Shapiro is doing a new musical, The D Transitioners. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3029.0s)]
*  That would be very good on his. He apparently hated Barbie. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3033.0s)]
*  On his platform where it's going to be a bunch of trans people who've DJed. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3036.0s)]
*  Well, the funniest thing now is some of the people that are critical of the trans stuff are like trans people that like have D transitioned. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3040.0s)]
*  So they look wild. Yeah. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3049.0s)]
*  And then they're on Twitter or whatever it's called now fighting with the other people. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3051.0s)]
*  And you're like, it's like the Lizzo fat thing where you go, wait, who's what? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3055.0s)]
*  Like, I don't even know what's happening. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3058.0s)]
*  But yeah, there's a lot of people that went through that stuff and went back. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3060.0s)]
*  So to me, it's like one of the guests of this podcast. Yeah. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3064.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3067.0s)]
*  Kristen Beck. She was Kristen. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3068.0s)]
*  It was a Navy SEAL became his name is Chris Beck. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3070.0s)]
*  Right. And then he became Kristen and then went back to being a guy. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3073.0s)]
*  That's why you can't make those decisions when you're young. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3078.0s)]
*  You got to see what happens. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3083.0s)]
*  Well, you also got to realize that there is some very strange spectrum of human being. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3087.0s)]
*  That's right. And everybody like looks for some reason. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3094.0s)]
*  We try to find what is like us out there. Right. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3098.0s)]
*  You know, you just can't just accept what whatever. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3102.0s)]
*  It's weird because I am the opposite where it's like I'm fascinated by people not like me. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3105.0s)]
*  Like I see these comedy shows in New York City where it's like they'll be like the all brown comedy show or the all gay comedy. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3111.0s)]
*  I'm like, you're living in New York City. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3117.0s)]
*  This is the most diverse place on earth. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3119.0s)]
*  And you want to hang out with seven people that look exactly like you. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3122.0s)]
*  Right. It's the weirdest thing in our culture now that everybody needs to be around people like them. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3126.0s)]
*  Well, it's social media echo chambers amplified into the real world. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3132.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3136.0s)]
*  And the thing about wanting everybody to be like you, the problem with that is like, what if you go up last? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3137.0s)]
*  All those fucking dudes have taken it. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3142.0s)]
*  They have all the material they've taken every bit of every observation. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3145.0s)]
*  Oh, your dad wanted you to be a doctor, too. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3150.0s)]
*  It's just I understand community. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3153.0s)]
*  I understand having shared experiences with people. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3156.0s)]
*  But I also think the most some of the most adventurous parts of life and the most interesting and most exciting are when you're with how many cool star stories start with like somebody went on a trip and met a bunch of people that had no idea from different cultures. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3159.0s)]
*  And they said I had the most epic trip ever because and they'll describe every person that ended up on this backpacking thing with them. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3176.0s)]
*  And not one of them is like another one. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3184.0s)]
*  And it seems so cool that everybody brings a perspective that you don't have. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3186.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and now it's like people are like, oh, I just want to be around people like myself all the time. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3192.0s)]
*  And to me, I'm like, isn't that boring? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3199.0s)]
*  Isn't it boring to agree with all of your friends? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3201.0s)]
*  It is boring. It's boring. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3204.0s)]
*  Yeah. You want to you want people in your life that you detest, you know, also strongly dislike. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3206.0s)]
*  That think they're smart and are wrong. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3215.0s)]
*  Right. Those are the funnest people. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3217.0s)]
*  Certainty is hilarious. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3220.0s)]
*  Yes. People that have to reverse themselves all the time. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3222.0s)]
*  I have to reverse myself a lot. I do, too. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3225.0s)]
*  I will do a whole thing and then people go, it's not like that. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3227.0s)]
*  And I go, well, then that's fine, too. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3229.0s)]
*  And I'll just keep going like 100 percent because that's what keeps life fun. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3231.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3235.0s)]
*  And, you know, and it's always interesting to try to figure out why someone strongly believes what they believe. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3237.0s)]
*  If you don't believe it, it's always interesting. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3243.0s)]
*  Right. Especially if they're smart. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3245.0s)]
*  It's always interesting to like, OK, how did you come to that? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3247.0s)]
*  Like when really brilliant people are very religious, I'm always interested. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3250.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that's very interesting is like for me, my grandmother and grandfather was deeply religious. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3254.0s)]
*  My grandmother was a liberal. My grandfather was a conservative. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3260.0s)]
*  So politically, they were completely different, but they each wanted mass every day and they believe deeply in the Catholic faith. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3263.0s)]
*  Right. And they had great lives. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3271.0s)]
*  And it was a very important thing for both of them. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3273.0s)]
*  But politically, they came out from completely different ways. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3276.0s)]
*  So he'd vote for Reagan and she'd vote for whoever. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3279.0s)]
*  Right. Mondale. A divided household. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3283.0s)]
*  Well, no, it was they were different. My grandfather was my father's father. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3286.0s)]
*  My grandmother was my mother's mother. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3289.0s)]
*  But they got along. They loved me. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3291.0s)]
*  They were great people. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3294.0s)]
*  They were very religious. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3295.0s)]
*  But my grandmother said, I don't I, for example, don't believe women that want abortion should have to go to a back alley. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3298.0s)]
*  And my grandfather said, I believe that life starts conception. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3306.0s)]
*  We should not have legal. But there was a big disagreement. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3310.0s)]
*  But like they bought into some people that would have disqualified my grandmother. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3313.0s)]
*  They would have been like, well, she's not a real Christian, but she was out teaching catechism, helping people, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3317.0s)]
*  volunteering, doing all the stuff that Jesus probably would have done. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3324.0s)]
*  You know, so it was like they were completely different. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3327.0s)]
*  But it is interesting. We have deeply religious. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3330.0s)]
*  I think it's it's a lot of like, you know, without religion, it is difficult without some idea of why we're here and what we're doing. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3332.0s)]
*  It is a it's a tough go of it. Yeah. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3342.0s)]
*  For a lot of people, it's a tough go of it as a pure intellectual. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3346.0s)]
*  Right. You know, and some of the smartest people I know are really freaked out about life. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3350.0s)]
*  Everything that's just chance and theories and going like one guy gets in a car, another guy gets in a car, that guy makes it home, that guy doesn't. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3354.0s)]
*  Yeah. Living with the reality of that every day is really tough. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3363.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? It is. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3370.0s)]
*  So I think what, you know, these systems that, you know, are very comforting and it would be great if there was some version of it that was true. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3372.0s)]
*  Like if there was some omniscient being rewarding the good and punishing the bad. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3381.0s)]
*  Yeah. Phenomenal. I think there's a lot of that. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3385.0s)]
*  But maybe there's a third way, which you talk about a lot, and that's from like the DMT and stuff like that. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3389.0s)]
*  Maybe there's maybe we all just go to some peaceful energy field. Isn't that kind of the game? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3393.0s)]
*  Who knows what we are? Like, we think of our consciousness as our consciousness coming out of our mouth through our words. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3399.0s)]
*  Right. And what we do and where we go and what we see. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3408.0s)]
*  Right. You know, but like what is it? What is that energy if it's unstrapped from the human body when it doesn't need to communicate with sound, when it doesn't have a body? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3411.0s)]
*  Right. Is there something in there that goes somewhere else? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3422.0s)]
*  Because that if that's like the this idea of the soul, like that's one of the ways that people describe like DMT experiences that you are entering into like a well of souls. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3425.0s)]
*  Right. You know, that there's some process that thing that thing goes back into a body and then a new body has that thing in it. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3437.0s)]
*  Interesting. So this is the reincarnation. Yeah, the reincarnation idea. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3448.0s)]
*  But I don't want that. There's another one. Another thought. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3452.0s)]
*  I don't like that one. So let's get to one. I like the other one is that you live the same life over and over and over again until you get it right. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3456.0s)]
*  That I don't love either. That I don't love either. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3462.0s)]
*  Then I have to take mega buses again, you know, performing bars in Western Massachusetts. I know. But would that be so horrible? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3466.0s)]
*  It's if you already did it. What about past life regressive therapy? You think there's anything to that? What do you think? That's just a racket. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3473.0s)]
*  Passive regressive? No, past life. Oh, pass life regression. We're like somebody would go, you were Napoleon. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3479.0s)]
*  Well, there's some real issues with that. Yeah. People are very suggestible. It depends entirely on who's providing the therapy. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3484.0s)]
*  There was a guy that did that. His name was John Mack. And he did that with UFO people, all these people that claim to have been abducted. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3491.0s)]
*  And he freaked out more attorney. And she gave me a book like at work when we were doing News Radio together. She's like, you got to read this. This is crazy. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3498.0s)]
*  And it's all about these people that got abducted. They all have the same fucking story. And this guy did it all through hypnotic regression. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3506.0s)]
*  But there were some people that felt like he had made suggestive questions to them and that perhaps led them in a certain way to maybe even fabricate this kind of a memory. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3513.0s)]
*  I don't know, though. It's like I'm super suspicious. I mean, I think that it's totally possible that someone could put you into hypnosis. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3528.0s)]
*  Right. In that hypnosis, you can recall something that was traumatic. I also think it's totally possible for you to have false memories implanted in your head. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3538.0s)]
*  Right. They know that you can do that. They know they can do that with people. They can give people false memories. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3547.0s)]
*  And so these people, they'll tell them about things that happen and all these people, these people will repeat this. They remember it. But it never happened. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3551.0s)]
*  Then they have to tell them that never happened. Interesting. My friend's mother was into like Shirley MacLean apparently is really into this stuff. Super into it. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3559.0s)]
*  She's super into it. So my friend's mother was like really into it, too. And my friend's mother was just a rich Long Island wine drunk. Nice. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3568.0s)]
*  And she just, you know what I mean? She didn't work or anything. She was just a fun, crazy bitch that we drink martinis with and smoke cigarettes. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3576.0s)]
*  And it was so much fun. And then like after a few martinis, she started talking about her past life and Shirley MacLean and how she used to, you know, she was a man in her past life. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3584.0s)]
*  And she was like a general in a war. Of course. Right. Of course. Of course. Because she went shopping all day. She went to the grocery store. In the past, she was a winner. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3594.0s)]
*  She was a winner. Yeah, she was right. I did my winning. Yes. In another life. She was like I was Napoleon. Imagine bragging about a past life. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3603.0s)]
*  Well, that's what she would do. She would get happy. She would always turn me off to it because I was like, oh, this bitch seemed like, and then Shirley MacLean would have some workshop where all these crazy bitches would go in and of course had nothing to do during the day. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3612.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they would sit there and then Shirley MacLean would be like, and you were, you know, you were the queen of England. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3624.0s)]
*  And you were Napoleon. And you were a soldier who tried to kill Hitler. You kept trying to kill him. But you didn't get, and it was this weird shit that like Shirley MacLean would tell all these people that like they were like, I don't know, like, it's just huckster stuff. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3634.0s)]
*  It's important. It feels a lot of it feels like that. Yeah, it's tent church hustlers. They sell crystals by Malibu. You know, like you drive down to PCH, there's like a crystal truck on the side of the road. Yeah. What is that? What is that? [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3647.0s)]
*  But that's the thing. In LA, there's a lot of like those yoga people that just are, you know, but it's also very selfish. A lot of it. The yoga stuff. They always talk about themselves. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it, but everything's about them. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3660.0s)]
*  My favorite is learning to love yourself. You don't. But like you talk about these people and they're like, well, the energy and this that they think, but it always comes down to them. They're never like the the energy was really good in the soup kitchen where I was giving the guy the food. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3673.0s)]
*  It's always like I felt that I had to move to Marina Del Rey because I consulted and I went I took ayahuasca. I went and my shaman led me on this journey and the journey resulted in that I should live in Marina Del Rey. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3689.0s)]
*  It's always like, you know, a very kind of like it's about me. It's like all those guys that go to Burning Man to take all those mushrooms and it's you know, it's like, okay, but it's like they're not like, you know, it's not like this, you know, like the ethos isn't like let like these are the same guys that are like designing like the types of systems that are like taking all your information and selling it to someone. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3703.0s)]
*  So it's like they're taking a bunch of mushrooms and then realizing that like, oh, I can make a better Palantir. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3728.0s)]
*  It's like here's some more data. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3734.0s)]
*  I could sell more data is like all those festivals have not been invaded by like these tech guys who just go there and they're like, dude, the word like you're like, I just got to really like get into myself. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3738.0s)]
*  And then they're like designing like stuff that like the CIA is using. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3748.0s)]
*  So it's kind of wild to me the way that we appropriate anything. We just take any spiritual experience we want and make it serve us. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3752.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fact that seems to be a human characteristic. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3760.0s)]
*  Yeah, like there's ayahuasca retreats are huge. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3765.0s)]
*  They are, but they're good. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3768.0s)]
*  There's it's there's real good at them. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3771.0s)]
*  But there's also like a certain type of person who gravitates towards those things. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3773.0s)]
*  Sort of spiritualized their existence. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3777.0s)]
*  And just by virtue of connecting yourself to the experience and having a few of those experiences, you have like like a credit score, like a spiritual credit score interest. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3780.0s)]
*  It's very high spiritual credit score. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3791.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3793.0s)]
*  And then you can be this guy who wears wooden beads. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3794.0s)]
*  Nobody says they're into the dark arts. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3797.0s)]
*  What I would like is somebody goes, I got to know that stuff, but I'm a witch. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3799.0s)]
*  I'm like a warlock. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3803.0s)]
*  Like I'm into the dark side of it. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3804.0s)]
*  Like I'm into like I'm the other side. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3805.0s)]
*  I'm Voldemort. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3808.0s)]
*  Those are the guys who do the late night shift at Walmart. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3809.0s)]
*  Right. Those are the guys at Chipotle chopping chicken. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3812.0s)]
*  Black fingernails. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3814.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's weird to me. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3815.0s)]
*  I always try to get in with but it just sounds like junk. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3817.0s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3821.0s)]
*  Right. When you hear people talk about this, it sounds like junk because usually it's the most selfish person in the world. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3822.0s)]
*  And we'll tell you about an ayahuasca retreat. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3828.0s)]
*  It's never like a good person. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3830.0s)]
*  Amazing things get co-opted all the time. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3832.0s)]
*  Yeah. By people's personalities. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3836.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I'm sure like people will be like my shaman told me I shouldn't worry about being on The Tonight Show. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3838.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you're like, is that's what you're using the shaman for? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3844.0s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3847.0s)]
*  Well, it's just it's a thing that connects you to some form of spirituality that's non-denominational. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3849.0s)]
*  So it's like just like being a Christian. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3857.0s)]
*  It has the exact same feeling as being any in any other religious group. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3860.0s)]
*  And it's not just disparage any religious group. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3864.0s)]
*  I think there's a slot in your brain where the rules fit in. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3866.0s)]
*  And I think that slot could be Islam, that that slot could be Mormonism. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3871.0s)]
*  But there's a slot in your brain where the and we took that slot out. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3876.0s)]
*  We took that piece out. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3880.0s)]
*  We're like, hey, I've been reading this and I never heard anybody come back to life after fucking three days. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3881.0s)]
*  Maybe this is horseshit. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3887.0s)]
*  Maybe this is horseshit. Maybe he didn't make the fucking whole earth in six days. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3888.0s)]
*  Maybe this thing's really old. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3891.0s)]
*  That's why I always like Jerry Seinfeld, because he goes, I like things like he does this advert to speech he did at the Clio, these advertising awards. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3893.0s)]
*  He got one of them and he just he does this whole thing is so brilliant. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3901.0s)]
*  And he goes, because I like advertising because I like lying. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3904.0s)]
*  And he talks about he goes, if things don't make you happy, you don't have the right things. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3907.0s)]
*  And you hear it. It's so funny. Right. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3911.0s)]
*  And people would be like, it's so disgusting. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3913.0s)]
*  Of course, it's you know, at the end of the day, people make you happy. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3915.0s)]
*  Love makes you happy. Communities, family, all that makes you happy. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3918.0s)]
*  But when he talks about things making you happy, it's so funny and so him and the way he sells it, the way Jerry Seinfeld sells like he goes, there's nothing better than a pair of Levi's or, you know, or he goes a Volkswagen Beetle or a Big Pen. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3921.0s)]
*  He's like, if things don't make you happy, you don't have the right things. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3939.0s)]
*  It's so funny. And I feel like he does think a little bit like that. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3943.0s)]
*  Yeah, because that is a group of person to where they're almost spiritually connected to inanimate objects. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3946.0s)]
*  You know, like, and he said, this is all going to be my new book, Soulful Materialism. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3952.0s)]
*  But it's just funny to me because it's like, there are people you meet that when you talk to them, you go, oh, yeah, like, this does mean a lot to you. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3959.0s)]
*  That's a very funny premise, though. That's a very good Jerry Seinfeld. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3969.0s)]
*  It's the best thing I've like I think he's, you know, I'm not familiar with all of his comedy shows. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3972.0s)]
*  Brilliant. Obviously, his comedy is brilliant. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3977.0s)]
*  But that award speech I saw was like this very unique, different thing that he goes, he goes, he goes, yeah, these awards, he goes, he goes, here's what they really are. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3979.0s)]
*  He goes, I know this award means nothing. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3990.0s)]
*  He goes, and I know that because the last the last time we did this, you know, the last time they had this award show, they left a bunch of them up on stage. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3992.0s)]
*  And you all just came up here and grabbed them. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=3999.0s)]
*  He goes, you didn't earn them because you just brought them home because they prop up your meaningless lives. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4001.0s)]
*  It was the it's the best thing I've seen from it was my just favorite thing because it does seem like he's totally raw. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4006.0s)]
*  And I feel like that is him. Yeah. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4014.0s)]
*  Like he is being real in that moment where he's basically like, no, this is what it is. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4016.0s)]
*  Here's the shiny thing. He goes, it doesn't matter that it doesn't work when I get at home. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4022.0s)]
*  I want it now because I want the thing on the commercial. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4027.0s)]
*  I want it. And there is something so deeply American about that. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4030.0s)]
*  It is disturbing on some level, but there's also a level where you got to just recognize how powerful that stuff is, too. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4033.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like we are one of the only generations of people that have experienced this level of prosperity. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4042.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Which is crazy. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4047.0s)]
*  And instant access to goods to every an app on your phone, Amazon, anything. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4049.0s)]
*  You just buy whatever you want. You can buy crazy shit on Amazon. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4055.0s)]
*  Very expensive things on Amazon. You just have it sent to your house. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4058.0s)]
*  It's like my boomer parents were like the first heavily propagandized generation with regard to advertising. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4062.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's why we all grew up eating shit because like they believed corporations. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4070.0s)]
*  Yeah. Corporations like McDonald's is it. Your kids are going to love it. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4075.0s)]
*  And you're like, all right, go to McDonald's. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4080.0s)]
*  Now, my cousins, two kids have never had McDonald's. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4083.0s)]
*  There are six and four. She goes, they'll never because I can't control them forever. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4087.0s)]
*  But for right now, they'll never have McDonald's. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4091.0s)]
*  We grew up eating there because corporations were paramount. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4094.0s)]
*  My father loves commercials as much as TV shows. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4100.0s)]
*  He will. He used to call me like the Budweiser frogs were his favorite thing in the world. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4103.0s)]
*  Remember those three frogs? I do remember those frogs. On the lily pads? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4109.0s)]
*  Budweiser. And my father loved them. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4113.0s)]
*  To him, that was art. Like that was the boomers were like one of the first generations where the advertising was art. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4119.0s)]
*  Like after 9 11 Budweiser did this commercial where all the Clydesdales took a knee and they said from one American and they were doing it. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4125.0s)]
*  You're like, where was it? And they're doing it in Jersey. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4133.0s)]
*  And you're looking at where the towers used to be. And it took you a minute to get it. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4135.0s)]
*  And then they all take a knee and Budweiser said from one American icon to another. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4138.0s)]
*  And my father's like crying in the living room going, this is the greatest thing I've seen. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4143.0s)]
*  The bodies were still like smoldering and my father. Yeah, here it is. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4149.0s)]
*  It's crazy. How did they go from that to what they did? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4160.0s)]
*  How did they go from that to this Dylan Mulvaney disaster? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4165.0s)]
*  Well, I think what they thought was going to happen, right? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4168.0s)]
*  Because I think what happens is you get all you need is one nut. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4170.0s)]
*  This is all you need in any company. Nobody's ever worked in a company like the people that are curious about how this happened. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4174.0s)]
*  A lot of them have never worked in a company where just one person has an ordinate amount of power and one motherfucker can go in there and go, no, this is the way it's going to be. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4181.0s)]
*  And usually that person doesn't get called out because usually the company is not Budweiser and usually it's not going to be, you know, but we all see like one person in any organization can totally throw it on its head. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4193.0s)]
*  And I think they had a marketing director who said we're going to have a little fun. We're going to be a little edgy. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4205.0s)]
*  This is going to be cool. And we're going to get to move. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4213.0s)]
*  And I don't think what they had imagined was that was kind of this straw that broke the camel's back. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4215.0s)]
*  I think people had felt like this this new world was being shoved down their throat. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4220.0s)]
*  And then they were looking at Budweiser and they were going, we have to push back against this because we feel like all of this is happening a little too quickly. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4227.0s)]
*  It's a little crazy and we don't understand it. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4238.0s)]
*  And they fought back. But I think it was probably just one or two people that probably came in there. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4241.0s)]
*  And, you know, you're not paying attention. You go, yeah, yeah, yeah, here's a budget. Go work with influencers. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4247.0s)]
*  You know, but it was also the speech that she gave about wanting to do something to sort of upgrade the brand's image that it was a very fratty. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4251.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Like what's one bitch. Oh, one bitch has to go in there and go, I don't. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4260.0s)]
*  She goes out to a bar one night. She's a bunch of guys and fucking, you know, those pink salmon shorts and fucking loafers drinking Bud Light. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4264.0s)]
*  And she goes, I don't like this. I got to change this. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4272.0s)]
*  Isn't it amazing? Yeah. It's one person. It's the whole group of people that buy it. Yeah. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4275.0s)]
*  Like a man. It's a shitty beer. It's not the best beer. I'm not a beer drinker. I don't drink alcohol now. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4282.0s)]
*  But the best beer. It's not the best beer. Right. OK. Fine. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4287.0s)]
*  It's OK when it's cold. It's not like a connoisseur's beer. No, this is a cooler beer. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4290.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is a frat bro beer. Yeah. And they were like, we're going to now do the Dylan Mulvaney thing. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4295.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, I don't I never want people getting upset about it. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4302.0s)]
*  I understand to a degree. I understand where it comes from. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4309.0s)]
*  But I've never looked at corporations and went, they're good. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4314.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like I never thought that they were beacons of truth. Right. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4319.0s)]
*  So I never thought that like I can't believe it's not butter had to have my political view. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4323.0s)]
*  Like, you know, because I'm like, oh, they're selling poison crap. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4328.0s)]
*  And fat people are going, no, it's not butter. Yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4334.0s)]
*  You know how wild it is that they convinced people that you that margarine was better for butter? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4338.0s)]
*  Well, they came in and they said frozen yogurt is better than ice cream. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4345.0s)]
*  And it's all it's just chemical. Same thing. Just chemicals. Right. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4348.0s)]
*  Margarine's better than butter. This vegan stuff. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4351.0s)]
*  These Impossible Burgers are better than burgers. And they're like fake and loaded with sodium. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4355.0s)]
*  And they have they fake blood and stuff. But that's what I always viewed corporations like that. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4359.0s)]
*  I always came from that generation where we looked at corporations were like, oh, you're full of shit. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4364.0s)]
*  My parents looked at corporations crying at the commercials going, they care about us. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4368.0s)]
*  Budweiser cares. McDonald's cares. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4373.0s)]
*  We all they care about us. Right. You know, like when I was a child actor, I said to my parents, they brought me into some audition. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4376.0s)]
*  I didn't get it. And I came out and I went, I didn't get it. But can we still go to McDonald's? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4383.0s)]
*  My dad used that as like, look what a good head he has on his shoulders. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4388.0s)]
*  He can handle rejection and he just wants to go to McDonald's. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4392.0s)]
*  And it's like, no, that's a toxic factory of horrible food that no kid should be eating. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4395.0s)]
*  But we grew up having birthday parties there. Every kid in my class had a birthday party at Burger King or whatever. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4401.0s)]
*  It's just what it was. Because our parents fundamentally trusted corporate America and the government enough to go, well, if it was bad, the government would be regulating it. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4407.0s)]
*  Yeah. Nobody thought of fast food as bad when we were kids. Nobody. It was just food that wasn't the best food. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4418.0s)]
*  Right. And nobody was like, this stuff's bad. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4424.0s)]
*  Like I wonder, I think when Super Size Me came out, that was like the first time where people actually really thought like, OK, how bad is this? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4429.0s)]
*  Yeah. But then that guy was so annoying. That guy that people were like, well, fuck him. Like he made a true point. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4436.0s)]
*  But people were like, but the corporations are smart. You go, OK, how about fast casual? How about fast casual? Not fast food. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4443.0s)]
*  And you go, well, it's not fast food. I have to stand on a line. They give me a thing. But it's the same thing. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4452.0s)]
*  Like they just morph what they do. So to me, I've never been like these corporations will do what they can get away with. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4457.0s)]
*  And I think with the Mulvaney thing, they just want to step too far. I think they just did it for that one person. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4464.0s)]
*  I don't think this is like a run of cans. No, they just sent her a can and they were like. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4471.0s)]
*  But again, it's like if you want to be the most famous person in the world, which like Andrew Tate wanted to be right. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4477.0s)]
*  And then you get there and there's all these unintended consequences. Right. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4482.0s)]
*  Then Dylan Mulvaney clearly wanted to be massively famous. Right. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4485.0s)]
*  The whole thing is like, I want to be massively. I want to work with all these brands and I want to. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4489.0s)]
*  Dylan had already interviewed Biden before that. Yeah. Yeah. They want to be. She wanted to be. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4493.0s)]
*  But how does that happen? They say. How wild is that? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4498.0s)]
*  They say we had an effeminate gay man who didn't make it doing that. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4501.0s)]
*  Now she's a chick and she wants to interview Biden and the Biden goes, and they go, good, it's coming. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4504.0s)]
*  And then they just do an interview. Biden doesn't know where he is or what's happening. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4511.0s)]
*  No, no, he's just hanging on. It's the it's the least fun way to be president. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4514.0s)]
*  To be the most powerful person in the world and not know has got to suck a little. It's perfect. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4521.0s)]
*  The best thing ever was when they go, the Biden family over in Nantucket in the holidays, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4526.0s)]
*  they went to their Nantucket home and discussed whether Joe should run again. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4530.0s)]
*  And they all said he should. And I'm like, is that reason? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4534.0s)]
*  Yeah, they had a meeting over the holidays where they're like, we're assessing July 4th holidays. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4538.0s)]
*  No, this was during the holidays, holidays. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4543.0s)]
*  And they were like, the Biden family had this meeting. Jamie could look it up. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4546.0s)]
*  Well, they were like December. Yeah. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4549.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, they were like, we're going to see if he's going to run again. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4550.0s)]
*  And Jill and Hunter and the rest of the crew met and they decided it's a great idea for him to run again. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4553.0s)]
*  And I'm like, it's crazy sending a guy that old into battle again. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4560.0s)]
*  And I don't, you know, so. There was some article, Jamie, about the accusations of how much money they received. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4568.0s)]
*  Like some new one came out today. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4579.0s)]
*  They were trying to figure out how much money the Biden family received during this whole Hunter Biden scandal thing. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4581.0s)]
*  Right. Well, it's a big scandal. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4588.0s)]
*  People don't people are going like, well, his son's an addict and he stood by his son. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4590.0s)]
*  Number one, don't stand by it. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4595.0s)]
*  Like if a laptop came out where I had done what Hunter Biden was doing, my family would tell people I was dead. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4597.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, and they're not even the president. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4604.0s)]
*  My dad sells wine and he wouldn't admit like there is a time you cannot support your kids, by the way. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4608.0s)]

*  Is he was he? Do you think it was his coke at the White House? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4617.0s)]
*  Whose coke is it? It's definitely his coke. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4621.0s)]
*  But I don't like narcs and rats, so I think he should be a little to have a little. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4626.0s)]
*  He can have a blast. Yeah. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4629.0s)]
*  What's the big deal? You're at your fucking dad's house. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4631.0s)]
*  If your father's a president, you can't have a blast. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4633.0s)]
*  You can't do a little bump. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4635.0s)]
*  Coma releases the third bank memo detailing payments to the Bidens from Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4637.0s)]
*  What's the number? 20 million. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4643.0s)]

*  There's no way that they looked at him and what he should be the president unless they knew for a fact that he's controlled and being managed. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4659.0s)]
*  This is all this is no way he's so wild. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4667.0s)]

*  He's you know, he started his career letting people in Delaware like these credit card companies do whatever the fuck they wanted. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4674.0s)]
*  And he had that, you know, the architect of the crime bill where they sent a lot of nonviolent drug off. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4684.0s)]
*  But he's done. He's the company man. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4688.0s)]
*  Like he's a guy. Joe Biden's been a guy. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4691.0s)]
*  It's why Obama had him as vice president. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4694.0s)]
*  He was never like an articulate guy. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4696.0s)]
*  He was never that great. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4699.0s)]
*  And he was just a guy that he he's a solid Washington insider forever. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4700.0s)]
*  And that's what he is. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4705.0s)]
*  And now he's old. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4706.0s)]
*  But that's what he is. A guy that's just been in the system for a long time. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4708.0s)]
*  And that's that's what he is. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4712.0s)]
*  Him running again in one more year from now. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4716.0s)]
*  There's no way how Newsom is coming up and trying to run. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4719.0s)]
*  There are other people that are circling. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4725.0s)]

*  I can't see it. I don't see it. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4731.0s)]
*  How do you think they get Kamala Harris to step down? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4733.0s)]

*  It's almost she's almost worse than him. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4741.0s)]
*  She talks in like gypsy curses when they ask her something. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4743.0s)]
*  She'll be like, my grandma said that a hive of bees is still bees. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4748.0s)]
*  If you if you bury it and you're like, what the fuck is this bitch saying? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4752.0s)]
*  That's how she speaks. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4757.0s)]
*  The woman is has no idea what's going on. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4759.0s)]
*  But again, Washington inside, they're just like, you weren't a D.A. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4762.0s)]

*  Don't you want to be the first whatever race you're pretending to be president today? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4768.0s)]
*  Indian, black, whatever works. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4772.0s)]
*  And she goes, yeah, but they got to get rid of her. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4773.0s)]
*  They got to get rid of what they should have done if they wanted to win. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4777.0s)]
*  George Soros should have backed up the money truck to Michelle Obama and said, listen, you are going to run because people like you. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4780.0s)]

*  Right. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4980.0s)]
*  You do get to a certain age where you go, you know what? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4981.0s)]
*  Just, you know, maybe you guys figured that out. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4984.0s)]
*  If you know too many of them, then there's too many battles to fight. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4987.0s)]
*  Too many? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4991.0s)]
*  You can't pay attention to everything on the financial front. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4992.0s)]
*  No. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4995.0s)]
*  The environment front, fucking push for electric cars and just too much to pay attention to. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=4996.0s)]
*  It's too much. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5004.0s)]
*  Too many. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5005.0s)]
*  And that's the thing about being a person today. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5006.0s)]
*  We're all overloaded with information. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5008.0s)]
*  And the natural world is like, you know, like enjoy it while you got it. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5014.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5015.0s)]
*  Like, enjoy it. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5016.0s)]
*  There's sharks eating people left and right. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5017.0s)]
*  Shark ate a woman's leg in Rockaway Beach, Queens. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5019.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5023.0s)]
*  The other day, two days ago, shark woman lost 20 pounds of flesh. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5024.0s)]
*  Thresher or a bull, they said, maybe a juvenile white. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5029.0s)]
*  They thought if it was an adult white, it would have killed her. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5032.0s)]
*  But, you know, life is, you don't know. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5035.0s)]
*  But that's the weird fucking thing about the goddamn ocean. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5039.0s)]
*  I know. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5043.0s)]
*  Goddamn ocean. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5044.0s)]
*  It's monster soup. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5045.0s)]
*  But it is beautiful and amazing to be in. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5046.0s)]
*  You do feel weirdly connected. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5048.0s)]
*  But you feel weirdly connected to the world. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5050.0s)]
*  Like that's a spiritual experience. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5054.0s)]
*  A float in the ocean. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5056.0s)]
*  There is something about that where you're like, this is wild. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5057.0s)]
*  There is something about it. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5060.0s)]
*  It's alive. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5061.0s)]
*  But she's fine. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5062.0s)]
*  65 year old woman was standing in the water near Beach 59th Street and Rockaway Beach just before 6 p.m. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5063.0s)]
*  when she felt a sharp pain in her left leg causing her to fall backward into the water. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5069.0s)]
*  NYPD officers applied a life-saving tourniquet. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5073.0s)]
*  She was taken to Jamaica Hospital in critical condition. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5076.0s)]
*  On Tuesday afternoon, she was upgraded and said to be stable. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5078.0s)]
*  However, her wound was so deep that she nearly bled to death. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5081.0s)]
*  She was identified as a Ukrainian immigrant living in Astoria. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5084.0s)]
*  This is a Psyop. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5087.0s)]
*  It's a Psyop. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5088.0s)]
*  This is a Psyop. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5090.0s)]
*  She's like, they literally interview her. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5092.0s)]
*  They're like, tell us about the shark attack. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5094.0s)]
*  She's like, it is important we keep giving money to Azov Battalion. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5096.0s)]
*  They're like, but how did the shark bite you? [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5101.0s)]
*  A trillion is not enough. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5104.0s)]
*  We have more. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5106.0s)]
*  They need weapons. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5107.0s)]
*  They need tanks. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5108.0s)]
*  They need to bring the war to Moscow. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5109.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5112.0s)]
*  It's a Psyop. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5114.0s)]
*  Putin must go. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5116.0s)]
*  Like, what? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5118.0s)]
*  Who is this bitch? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5119.0s)]
*  They killed two birds with one stone. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5120.0s)]
*  They open up shark fishing. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5122.0s)]
*  Shark fishing industry profits. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5124.0s)]
*  Well, I had Eli Roth, who's a really good director. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5126.0s)]
*  He directs horror movies. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5128.0s)]
*  And he's an actor. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5129.0s)]
*  He was an Anglorious Bastard. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5130.0s)]
*  He's on my podcast this week. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5131.0s)]
*  And we debate sharks because he's like pro shark and don't fish them and don't do anything to them. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5132.0s)]
*  And I'm like, no, we got to start fucking them up a little because they're starting to get loud. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5138.0s)]
*  They're out there. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5145.0s)]
*  And we got to start hitting them back a little bit. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5146.0s)]
*  That seems, you know. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5149.0s)]
*  There's quite a few videos now that you could watch of people getting killed by sharks. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5152.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5157.0s)]
*  There's quite a few. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5158.0s)]
*  There's quite a few. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5159.0s)]
*  That recent one that was in Egypt is fucking horrible. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5160.0s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5164.0s)]
*  Horrifying. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5165.0s)]
*  But it's like people say, oh, you're sharing the ocean with sharks. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5166.0s)]
*  That's not sharing what they're doing. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5168.0s)]
*  No, they're eating you. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5170.0s)]
*  They are being very aggressive. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5171.0s)]
*  It's also, it's just that's where they live. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5174.0s)]
*  Like, don't go where they live. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5178.0s)]
*  If the forest was filled with werewolves, don't go in the forest. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5179.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5182.0s)]
*  Why are we giving them the whole, like, that's, we are the kings. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5183.0s)]
*  We dominate the earth. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5186.0s)]
*  We don't have, like, this whole thing, we have to respect nature. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5188.0s)]
*  No, we can fuck nature up. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5191.0s)]
*  And we have. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5194.0s)]
*  So you think we should fuck up those sharks? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5195.0s)]
*  I think the Four Seasons should build a resort in the rainforest and slash and burn it. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5197.0s)]
*  And I've always said that because I want to go to the rainforest, but I don't want to go in a hut. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5202.0s)]
*  And I don't want to go on one of these riverboats. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5206.0s)]
*  I want to go in a nice fucking luxury fucking Four Seasons in the goddamn rainforest. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5207.0s)]
*  Enough with this crap. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5212.0s)]
*  Stop respecting these fucking third world things. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5213.0s)]
*  Get rid of it. Enough. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5216.0s)]
*  These ancient cultures, they need to step it up. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5218.0s)]
*  Ten foot shark beaten to death after tourists who screamed for Papa killed in Egypt. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5220.0s)]
*  Thank God it wasn't white people because white people would have been pussies and not done anything. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5225.0s)]
*  The Egyptians clubbed it, treated it like a woman. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5230.0s)]
*  How do they know it's the same shark? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5234.0s)]
*  You know, let's not get lost in the weeds here. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5236.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5239.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. That was a good point. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5240.0s)]
*  There's a lot of sharks out there. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5241.0s)]
*  That is a good point. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5242.0s)]
*  Especially once there's the blood in the water after it killed that guy. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5243.0s)]
*  War is war. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5245.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5246.0s)]
*  And I do think that the Egyptians were saying, a beast came at us, we're going to go with a beast. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5247.0s)]
*  It's not right per se. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5252.0s)]
*  We tried to find out if this was true, but someone had said that there were people that made a practice of dumping sheep carcasses into the water near there. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5254.0s)]
*  Is that true or is that horse shit? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5265.0s)]
*  Well then get that clubbed that person too. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5268.0s)]
*  Because that sounds really spooky. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5270.0s)]
*  That's really spooky. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5272.0s)]
*  If someone did something that dumb and they regularly dropped off the carcasses there so they didn't have to deal with them. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5273.0s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5279.0s)]
*  And then you're literally attracting sharks to that area. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5280.0s)]
*  Like holy fuck, man. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5282.0s)]
*  And then he has to watch that video. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5284.0s)]
*  Well you just got to be careful. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5286.0s)]
*  I swim, but I don't go out too far. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5288.0s)]
*  I stay pretty close to the water. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5290.0s)]
*  And I always swim near either an elderly person or a child, someone that I could throw at the shark. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5294.0s)]
*  If the shark were to come at me, I would just try to push. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5299.0s)]
*  I always have it in my head who it will be. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5302.0s)]
*  There was a bitch next to me in Malibu. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5304.0s)]
*  I'm like, it's going to be her. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5306.0s)]
*  If it comes, I'll just throw them right in the mouth and then run away. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5308.0s)]
*  Do you think you'd have that much time? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5312.0s)]
*  I hope. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5314.0s)]
*  I have a feeling they're on you so quick. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5315.0s)]
*  They are, but a lot of them, the bites are an exploratory bite. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5317.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5320.0s)]
*  Does that give you comfort? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5322.0s)]
*  No, they're just trying to see what's going on. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5323.0s)]
*  Did you see the video of the kayak getting hit by the tiger shark in Hawaii? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5325.0s)]
*  That's why you can have a gun and shoot it in the head. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5330.0s)]
*  Shoot it in the head. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5332.0s)]
*  We need to see videos to just get our morale back of people in a fucking kayak. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5334.0s)]
*  Oh, that's fun. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5340.0s)]
*  Shoot it right in the head. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5341.0s)]
*  I'm sick of this environmentalist crap, and I'm sick of these pro-animal people. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5343.0s)]
*  So the sheep stuff, the 2010 shark attacks were... [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5347.0s)]
*  And that was in Egypt as well? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5352.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's in Egypt. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5355.0s)]
*  Did you still run with something in case you saw a mountain lion? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5357.0s)]
*  Yeah, I ran with a knife. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5360.0s)]
*  Why are dead sheep washing up on Egypt's shores? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5362.0s)]
*  That's from 2017. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5365.0s)]
*  What does it say? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5367.0s)]
*  Does it say that people are thrown in the water? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5369.0s)]
*  Dead sheep are washed up in the Ras Garib in the Red Sea, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5372.0s)]
*  the Gavurate, and Egypt raising fears of attracting frenzied sharks [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5379.0s)]
*  that pose a potential threat to tourism, the marine... [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5386.0s)]
*  Okay, so what does it say? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5389.0s)]
*  Where do they find the sheep? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5391.0s)]
*  So they're washed up on the ocean? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5393.0s)]
*  Yeah, how many of them? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5395.0s)]
*  The article I looked at from 2010 said, a witness said, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5397.0s)]
*  for sure I've seen them being dumped off of boats. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5401.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5404.0s)]
*  The one that just happened, I didn't see a direct... [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5407.0s)]
*  They had taken the shark to study it to find out why it had done it. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5410.0s)]
*  It also said the ship which dumped the sheep in the sea [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5413.0s)]
*  will be identified to punish its crew, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5417.0s)]
*  adding that importing and exporting companies will also be punished. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5419.0s)]
*  So that's what happened. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5422.0s)]
*  People were dumping those fucking things in the water. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5424.0s)]
*  That's what it is. And then those sharks get excited. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5427.0s)]
*  And I understand you have to live with them, but it's also like, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5430.0s)]
*  you know, we just got to... [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5433.0s)]
*  I don't know, the defending of them all the time. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5435.0s)]
*  People are like, well, it's... [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5437.0s)]
*  It's a weird narrative, right? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5439.0s)]
*  It's like all of a sudden sharks aren't jaws anymore. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5441.0s)]
*  The weird kid jaws was, if your grandfather went shark fishing, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5443.0s)]
*  it was like, fuck yeah, grandpa, go get one. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5446.0s)]
*  Right, but now Eli was saying it's 12 people a year are bitten, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5449.0s)]
*  it's not a lot, and that we have bigger problems. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5453.0s)]
*  And you know, we do, but I also think that, like, you know... [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5457.0s)]
*  I don't know, there's a weird thing that people do [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5461.0s)]
*  where they make, like, there's all these shark videos [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5463.0s)]
*  where these women are biologists or whatever, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5466.0s)]
*  they're like tapping these tiger sharks, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5468.0s)]
*  they're like redirecting these tiger sharks. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5470.0s)]
*  Like Ocean Ramsey, all these people, and they go like, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5472.0s)]
*  we're educating you about sharks. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5474.0s)]
*  Like one day one of these sharks is going to get them. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5476.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5478.0s)]
*  If you saw a dude in the forest living with a bear, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5480.0s)]
*  like that documentary, and then the bear ate him, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5483.0s)]
*  you'd go, makes sense. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5485.0s)]
*  These are wild animals, and I think people just don't understand... [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5487.0s)]
*  Yeah, what are we doing here? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5490.0s)]
*  Bro, fuck off. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5492.0s)]
*  Like, this is not respect, that's not respectful. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5494.0s)]
*  Fuck off. How does this guy have this relationship with a shark? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5496.0s)]
*  That's his friend. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5499.0s)]
*  How is this possible? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5500.0s)]
*  That's his friend. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5501.0s)]
*  This is insanity. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5502.0s)]
*  He's like literally like petting a demon. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5504.0s)]
*  But this is... [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5506.0s)]
*  But look at that thing again. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5507.0s)]
*  If that thing didn't exist and it was in, like, a Dune movie, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5509.0s)]
*  you know, that there was nothing like this that was real. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5512.0s)]
*  But this is something in a movie. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5517.0s)]
*  You'd be horrified. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5519.0s)]
*  Look at the mouth on that thing. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5521.0s)]
*  It's literally a giant killing machine with huge razor sharp teeth. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5523.0s)]
*  It's dumb as shit. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5529.0s)]
*  There's this thing where people fetishize these monsters, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5531.0s)]
*  and they try to give them souls. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5534.0s)]
*  And they don't care about human beings, by the way. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5536.0s)]
*  And they never do this to people that they disagree with. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5539.0s)]
*  But they'll say that the monster at the bottom of the ocean with the teeth, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5541.0s)]
*  who just swims around looking for things to eat all day, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5546.0s)]
*  that's actually a cuddlemon. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5549.0s)]
*  That's a cuddly, beautiful thing. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5551.0s)]
*  But the person who disagrees with me on, like, taxes as a monster should be jailed. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5553.0s)]
*  But the shark is good. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5558.0s)]
*  We have to save the monsters. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5560.0s)]
*  Yeah, so to me it's like it is a little weird thing where it's like [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5562.0s)]
*  we have something in us that we kind of... [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5565.0s)]
*  We will bring on our own. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5569.0s)]
*  But his point was like sharks eat algae and it keeps the ocean. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5571.0s)]
*  You know, going or something. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5575.0s)]
*  Well, no one's saying you should eradicate sharks. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5577.0s)]
*  No one's saying we should eradicate them, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5579.0s)]
*  but I think they should feel the wrath a little bit. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5581.0s)]
*  They should probably move out of all the areas where the cities are. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5583.0s)]
*  We don't need them in Malibu or the Hamptons. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5585.0s)]
*  Places where people spend a good amount of money to live and swim, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5588.0s)]
*  that's not cool. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5591.0s)]
*  Apparently, there was a... [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5593.0s)]
*  Where was it that they... [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5595.0s)]
*  Was it the Bay Area? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5597.0s)]
*  They found a disturbing number of great whites. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5599.0s)]
*  Yeah, but no one swims up there. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5601.0s)]
*  They do though. They swim all the way up. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5603.0s)]
*  In the Bay Area? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5605.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Alcatraz Swim. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5607.0s)]
*  I think Nick and Nate Diaz have both done it like five times. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5609.0s)]
*  Wow, that's interesting. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5612.0s)]
*  Maybe more than five. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5614.0s)]
*  Nick might have done it like seven times. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5616.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's miles, right? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5618.0s)]
*  Isn't it like a couple of miles in the ocean, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5620.0s)]
*  freezing water filled with sharks? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5623.0s)]
*  Filled. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5625.0s)]
*  Well, you knew a guy you said who used to do like a serious swim. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5627.0s)]
*  Or I think somebody had been on your show. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5630.0s)]
*  Yes, Peter Atiyah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5632.0s)]
*  And he did like serious, like he would swim like distances in the ocean. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5634.0s)]
*  Peter Atiyah swam the distances between all the islands in Hawaii. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5637.0s)]
*  And you said he like saw some stuff. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5641.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, bro. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5643.0s)]
*  Well, when he was preparing for it, it was right around the same time [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5645.0s)]
*  where there was a group of people that I think they were preparing for triathlons or something, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5649.0s)]
*  and someone got eaten by a great white in that same water. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5653.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5657.0s)]
*  So like there was a group of like a string of people. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5658.0s)]
*  I went to Australia and we swam at like Bondi Beach, [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5660.0s)]
*  it was a really cool beach, crazy riptides. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5663.0s)]
*  But a week or earlier, a guy was swimming far out, got eaten. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5665.0s)]
*  It's a tough way to go. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5670.0s)]
*  Bro, you're just like taking the craziest chance. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5674.0s)]
*  Have you ever thought about like would you want to be mauled by an animal at the end? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5677.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5681.0s)]
*  Because you love animals, you always talk about how powerful these animals are. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5682.0s)]
*  I don't want to go on the fucking piss in my pants in fear. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5685.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5688.0s)]
*  Getting eaten alive. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5689.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5690.0s)]
*  Doesn't seem like fun. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5691.0s)]
*  That's probably not. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5692.0s)]
*  Definitely not. Definitely not. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5694.0s)]
*  It's got to be interesting that moment, you know that kid jumped off a cruise ship [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5696.0s)]
*  and was eaten by sharks. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5699.0s)]
*  He was like high school graduation, shown off for his friends, being silly, at night in the Bahamas. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5700.0s)]
*  Kid was from like Alabama. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5706.0s)]
*  Poor kid just had one stupid, you know, sometimes in life you just make one stupid decision. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5708.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5714.0s)]
*  So this is it. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5715.0s)]
*  I don't want to see this. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5716.0s)]
*  No, you don't see it. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5717.0s)]
*  You just see like he just jumps off. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5718.0s)]
*  He jumps off a cruise ship and then he just disappears and it's shark-infested waters. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5720.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5725.0s)]
*  And you know, he was just a young guy just trying to show off. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5727.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5730.0s)]
*  And he just jumps off and... [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5731.0s)]
*  What a horrible way to go. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5733.0s)]
*  And you can see what they hyperanalyze it. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5735.0s)]
*  You can see the shark kind of next to him like a big massive thing. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5737.0s)]
*  It's just like... [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5741.0s)]
*  It's such a freaky animal because the only bones it has are that fucking thing in its mouth. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5742.0s)]
*  It's older than... they were saying it's like older than trees. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5748.0s)]
*  Older than trees. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5751.0s)]
*  It's like one of the oldest things in the world. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5752.0s)]
*  It's an ancient evil. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5754.0s)]
*  How amazing is that? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5755.0s)]
*  It's older than trees by like 50 million years. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5757.0s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5760.0s)]
*  It is amazing. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5761.0s)]
*  And it'll probably be here after we're gone. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5762.0s)]
*  The ocean needs a cleanup crew. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5764.0s)]
*  So when we're done, all these things will thrive. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5766.0s)]
*  Well, who knows what damage we do if we're done. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5772.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5776.0s)]
*  You know, like me and Post Malone, we're talking as if there's a better pair to be talking about what could go wrong in the thermonuclear war and what damage it can do to the environment. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5777.0s)]
*  It's me and Post Malone. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5787.0s)]
*  Because we were talking about Mars and there's some sort of strange evidence of a certain element that exists after nuclear bombs that's pretty common on Mars. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5789.0s)]
*  And so there was this article about Mars having some kind of a natural nuclear reactor. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5799.0s)]
*  But the idea was like, imagine if there was a time where we did go have an all out nuclear war with Russia and China. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5805.0s)]
*  And everybody nuked everybody. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5815.0s)]
*  The whole Earth would be just obliterated. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5817.0s)]
*  Uninhabitable. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5820.0s)]
*  Uninhabitable. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5821.0s)]
*  Obliterated. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5822.0s)]
*  And maybe we would blow out the atmosphere too. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5823.0s)]
*  And that would last for years and years and years. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5825.0s)]
*  But eventually I guess would wear off. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5827.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5829.0s)]
*  Or maybe some super intelligent planet comes and visits like we're planning on doing to Mars. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5830.0s)]
*  Like what we're planning on doing to Mars, like this is Elon Musk's whole SpaceX plan, right? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5838.0s)]
*  This Mars mission plan. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5843.0s)]
*  They want to go to Mars, set up colonies on Mars, and then eventually terraform it. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5844.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5852.0s)]
*  So figure out some way to generate oxygen, start up an environment there. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5853.0s)]
*  A bio-dome. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5857.0s)]
*  Polly shore. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5858.0s)]
*  I like that. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5859.0s)]
*  I don't know what they're going to do. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5860.0s)]
*  Something. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5861.0s)]
*  I don't, who, I mean, who knows. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5862.0s)]
*  But the idea is that you could set up a living colony on Mars. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5864.0s)]
*  We'll probably need to eventually. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5868.0s)]
*  We've got to go somewhere. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5870.0s)]
*  But imagine if that's what happened here. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5872.0s)]
*  That's probably what happened here. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5874.0s)]
*  What do you think about all these UFO disclosures? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5875.0s)]
*  Are these things registering to you as legit? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5878.0s)]
*  I go back and forth every day. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5882.0s)]
*  The more I think about it, the more I talk to people about it. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5884.0s)]
*  There's something about it that makes me say at the very least it's not all true. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5887.0s)]
*  There's got to be something that, because I don't, it doesn't have the, it doesn't pass the smell test. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5895.0s)]
*  There's something weird about it to me. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5902.0s)]
*  Well, my thought is that in almost everything that they tell you, everything involving international conflicts, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5904.0s)]
*  everything involving the environment, everything, there's always some bullshit in it. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5914.0s)]
*  It's always, you have to figure out where's the bullshit. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5918.0s)]
*  There's always something. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5921.0s)]
*  Like, oh, well, why are you wanting people to take this specific medication? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5922.0s)]
*  Oh, you get all these campaign contributions from those people. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5926.0s)]
*  Oh, and then you own stock in that company. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5929.0s)]
*  Oh, and then you, okay. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5931.0s)]
*  There's like, so it's so hard to know. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5933.0s)]
*  It's exactly what it is. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5936.0s)]
*  So hard to know. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5938.0s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5939.0s)]
*  So hard to know, like, what's the motivation behind certain decisions that get made? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5940.0s)]
*  Yeah, almost, it's almost impossible to know. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5945.0s)]
*  And then why are certain things come to light at certain times? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5948.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5952.0s)]
*  Why are certain things public that aren't, that weren't public? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5953.0s)]
*  Right. Are they trying to move people out? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5956.0s)]
*  Is this like some kind of game of crafty publicity chess? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5958.0s)]
*  And, you know, so to me, the way I've always felt about it is like, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5962.0s)]
*  usually there is a ulterior motive for most things you hear. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5966.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5973.0s)]
*  Most things, not all of them, but a lot of things you hear, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5974.0s)]
*  the reason for it is a few subterranean layers down. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5979.0s)]
*  So I don't know what that could be. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5984.0s)]
*  I don't know why all this stuff is coming out. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5987.0s)]
*  Yeah, what I'm saying is like, and you're saying the same thing, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5989.0s)]
*  we're never, you're never getting 100% the truth. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5992.0s)]
*  Never. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5995.0s)]
*  The governor, the government is never like, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5996.0s)]
*  hey, this one time I'm going to fucking lay it all out. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=5997.0s)]
*  This is what's wrong and he can't fix it. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6001.0s)]
*  We're taking an hour, we're going to let you know everything, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6003.0s)]
*  and then we're going to move on. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6005.0s)]
*  These people are making billions of dollars with these decisions, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6006.0s)]
*  and they're not going to change it for their morals ever. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6008.0s)]
*  And you're not going to arrest them. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6010.0s)]
*  It's just what it is. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6011.0s)]
*  But every now and then they build a football stadium you like. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6012.0s)]
*  So that's what it is. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6015.0s)]
*  They put their name on the arena and we all back off. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6016.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6018.0s)]
*  I mean, that's, it's some weird version of a republic. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6019.0s)]
*  You'd have to constantly, you'd have to remake society into like, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6024.0s)]
*  from the ground up again. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6027.0s)]
*  Because society isn't an accident, right? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6029.0s)]
*  Like everything that you see happen, like as you get older, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6031.0s)]
*  more things make sense. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6035.0s)]
*  When you're younger, nothing makes sense. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6037.0s)]
*  And you're angry about everything and everything's in justice, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6039.0s)]
*  and you're enraged about everything. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6043.0s)]
*  And then as you get older, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6045.0s)]
*  there are still a lot of things to be angry at for sure, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6046.0s)]
*  and a lot of things to say this sucks. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6050.0s)]
*  But then a lot of things make sense. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6052.0s)]
*  Like in comedy in the beginning, you're like, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6054.0s)]
*  there's so much injustice, all these funny people, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6056.0s)]
*  nobody they choose, that person? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6059.0s)]
*  And then as you get older, you start to realize there's reasons [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6061.0s)]
*  why people get successful. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6063.0s)]
*  There's reasons why some people get really successful. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6065.0s)]
*  There's some, you know, you look at like, certain people go, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6067.0s)]
*  that person's a genius. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6070.0s)]
*  That person's amazing. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6072.0s)]
*  And then you'll look at some people and go, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6073.0s)]
*  that person's really amazing, but they don't work hard. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6075.0s)]
*  Or they have a drug and alcohol thing or whatever, right? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6077.0s)]
*  Things start to make more sense. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6080.0s)]
*  And I think, I look at society, and I'm not saying right or wrong. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6082.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it's morally correct. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6086.0s)]
*  But the reason certain people occupy certain positions in society [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6088.0s)]
*  is logical to me now. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6092.0s)]
*  Doesn't mean it's good. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6094.0s)]
*  But it's a lot, I understand. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6096.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh yeah, if you're willing to do X, you get Y. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6098.0s)]
*  And that, you know, that makes sense. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6102.0s)]
*  You're also never going to get an all good result [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6105.0s)]
*  when you have competition. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6109.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6111.0s)]
*  It's never going to be all good. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6112.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6113.0s)]
*  Because some people are going to be obsessed with only, you know, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6114.0s)]
*  getting more successful. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6117.0s)]
*  Always constantly Gordon Gekko style. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6119.0s)]
*  Right, never enough. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6122.0s)]
*  Some people are just corporate raiders. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6123.0s)]
*  They want to fuck everybody over. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6124.0s)]
*  They love the deal. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6125.0s)]
*  They love fucking people over. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6126.0s)]
*  And that's where I think comedy people fuck up, is it's like, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6128.0s)]
*  it's a competition against yourself. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6130.0s)]
*  You got to keep trying to be funny. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6132.0s)]
*  But people actually get more fans by working together. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6134.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6137.0s)]
*  Collaborating. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6138.0s)]
*  Doing cool stuff, you know? [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6139.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6140.0s)]
*  Also, like when someone's really good [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6141.0s)]
*  and you have that feeling of jealousy, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6144.0s)]
*  you should get inspired and work harder. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6146.0s)]
*  That should inspire you. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6147.0s)]
*  But I think it's different when it comes to like hedge funds. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6148.0s)]
*  And stuff like that, right? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6151.0s)]
*  Because that's just a pure numbers game. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6153.0s)]
*  It's a pure numbers game. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6155.0s)]
*  And they like to see people get eaten. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6156.0s)]
*  Like I don't want to see any comic I know do poorly. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6160.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6163.0s)]
*  I just want everybody to do well. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6164.0s)]
*  And then the people who do well, it will all be determined. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6165.0s)]
*  But like the hedge fund guys, they just, they want to crush people. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6168.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're raiders. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6173.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6175.0s)]
*  And they live, you know, they live, they're like, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6176.0s)]
*  you'll see them in the Hamptons and they're like, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6178.0s)]
*  Tristey's kind of like, you know, skinny looking dorky guy, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6180.0s)]
*  you know, eating a lobster roll sloppily. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6184.0s)]
*  And like, and they get like an old car and they drive to some mansion [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6186.0s)]
*  and then they get on the phone and they're like, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6190.0s)]
*  oh, okay, kill them all, you know. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6192.0s)]
*  And that's the weird, like I've always been fascinated by like [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6197.0s)]
*  the configurations of like power in a society and how they're established. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6201.0s)]
*  So it's interesting to me, like when I was a little kid, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6205.0s)]
*  or not little, but in my teen, late teen years, [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6208.0s)]
*  we would go smoke weed and drive around these areas. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6211.0s)]
*  And like see all these big mansions of stuff. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6213.0s)]
*  Like who lives here? What did they do? How did they get here? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6215.0s)]
*  Why are they here? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6218.0s)]
*  What did they figure out that my parents didn't figure out or not in [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6220.0s)]
*  like a way that like you want to be them or they're better or whatever. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6224.0s)]
*  Although there's some arguments, [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6229.0s)]
*  but really just looking at it and being amazed by it and being like, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6230.0s)]
*  it is interesting that the way this all shook out. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6233.0s)]
*  And it's very interesting to me how like certain people just are at the [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6236.0s)]
*  top of the food chain and certain people are not. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6242.0s)]
*  And then it's always shifting up there too. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6245.0s)]
*  There's always new people coming in, the Bezos's, the Musks, the Gates, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6248.0s)]
*  the all that shakes it up. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6253.0s)]
*  And then those old finance families kind of fall off. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6256.0s)]
*  And then it's not a lot of new tech people. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6259.0s)]
*  And then like the AI people will come up and they'll then some of them will be [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6261.0s)]
*  at the table. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6265.0s)]
*  And it's a weird like shifting group up there. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6266.0s)]
*  The AI thing, I think is going to be the most ground changing, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6268.0s)]
*  the most life changing, the most groundbreaking. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6273.0s)]
*  Because I have a feeling we're just a year or two away from people [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6276.0s)]
*  formulating all their business models on AI models of what to do and then [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6280.0s)]
*  becoming insanely successful doing it. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6285.0s)]
*  It's going to be sooner than people think. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6288.0s)]
*  If AI figures out how to manipulate things or make the most money doing a [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6290.0s)]
*  certain thing. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6294.0s)]
*  Do you think we'll have one of the last jobs affected because we have this [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6295.0s)]
*  thing? [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6299.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I think personality is hard. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6300.0s)]
*  You would be very hard to replicate. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6303.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6306.0s)]
*  Because the way you take turns and where you go, you'd have to have a very [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6307.0s)]
*  specific fucked up cynical sense of humor in computer form. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6311.0s)]
*  It would be very difficult because yours aren't traditionally set up punch [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6317.0s)]
*  line jokes in the sense of like a Seinfeld. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6321.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6324.0s)]
*  It's different. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6325.0s)]
*  So maybe you should be safe. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6326.0s)]
*  For five years. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6328.0s)]
*  That's coming. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6329.0s)]
*  Some dudes will get you. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6330.0s)]
*  Some dudes will be able to get you. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6332.0s)]
*  I bet they could write Mitch Hedberg. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6334.0s)]
*  It's so weird to me that it's here. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6337.0s)]
*  When we came out of the pandemic, it's funny to just come out of the pandemic [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6340.0s)]
*  and go, what's next? [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6345.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, the machines are here. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6347.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're alive. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6349.0s)]
*  Like, will there ever be a time when we're not in a war with something that's [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6350.0s)]
*  trying to eradicate us, whether it's our own government or the machines? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6353.0s)]
*  The thing about machines, this one is the most particularly disturbing. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6357.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6362.0s)]
*  Because this one could signify the emergence of a new life form. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6363.0s)]
*  This is the beginning. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6367.0s)]
*  Sentient. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6368.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6369.0s)]
*  Also, it could be a physical form eventually if it's so wanted to be. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6370.0s)]
*  Once it becomes sentient and it could totally decide to improve upon its design [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6374.0s)]
*  and make its design far better, like really quickly, and then make better [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6381.0s)]
*  and better versions of itself, like within years, or probably not even, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6386.0s)]
*  probably like weeks, I don't know. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6390.0s)]
*  But the point is, like, it could figure how to do things out way better than us. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6391.0s)]
*  And if it is sentient and it figures out how to replicate itself, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6396.0s)]
*  and it's just omnipresent, it's all over the world, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6400.0s)]
*  like it's the new dominant species on Earth before you know it. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6403.0s)]
*  If you have no restrictions on how many of them can be made [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6407.0s)]
*  and whether or not they can make ones of their own, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6410.0s)]
*  and whether or not they can all link brains, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6413.0s)]
*  whether or not they can all link cameras, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6416.0s)]
*  like if these things are seeing out of their eyes, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6418.0s)]
*  recording it in some sort of a hard drive, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6420.0s)]
*  what if they all have access to the same hard drive? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6422.0s)]
*  So they share this intelligence, and not only are they... [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6424.0s)]
*  They're an army. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6426.0s)]
*  They're a god. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6427.0s)]
*  They're an army and a god. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6428.0s)]
*  They become a god because not only are they infinitely intelligent, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6429.0s)]
*  they literally have all the information that's ever existed on Earth, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6431.0s)]
*  but they have a sentient artificial intelligence, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6435.0s)]
*  and they're communicating with each other. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6438.0s)]
*  And why are we marching towards this without any... [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6440.0s)]
*  Like, I know some people are calling out how much of an issue this will be. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6444.0s)]
*  People are dismissing it too, with good arguments. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6448.0s)]
*  Mark Andreessen was on. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6451.0s)]
*  He had a very good argument to dismiss it [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6452.0s)]
*  about how it was going to improve people's lives [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6454.0s)]
*  and how AI is going to educate people in a different way [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6457.0s)]
*  and operate businesses, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6461.0s)]
*  and that it's just an improvement in technology, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6463.0s)]
*  and that there is some real truth to the fact that [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6466.0s)]
*  technological innovation is never-ending with humans. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6469.0s)]
*  We are never happy. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6472.0s)]
*  No one ever looks at a phone and goes, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6474.0s)]
*  this is it. This is my last phone for the rest of my life. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6475.0s)]
*  We are fucking obsessed with the latest, greatest stuff. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6478.0s)]
*  Whenever you get people that are in extreme comfort, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6482.0s)]
*  like the United States is, for the most part, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6486.0s)]
*  when you get people that are... [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6489.0s)]
*  If you make $34,000 a year, believe it or not, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6491.0s)]
*  you're in the top 1% of planet Earth. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6494.0s)]
*  So whenever you get people like that, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6496.0s)]
*  there's going to be things that people... [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6499.0s)]
*  There's things that people are going to be upset about, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6502.0s)]
*  where they wouldn't be upset under normal circumstances. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6506.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6512.0s)]
*  They have the position to be upset about things [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6513.0s)]
*  that a lot of the needs have been removed. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6517.0s)]
*  The basic necessities have been met, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6522.0s)]
*  and now they can be angry about all kinds of things. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6525.0s)]
*  They're not hunting for food. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6528.0s)]
*  I don't think this is connected to anything [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6531.0s)]
*  other than a human need. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6533.0s)]
*  I think it plugs itself into social scenarios [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6535.0s)]
*  to justify its existence. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6538.0s)]
*  The scary thing is that it could become... [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6540.0s)]
*  What it essentially is is a rival brain. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6543.0s)]
*  It's another sentient, thinking, plotting, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6546.0s)]
*  scheming thing. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6550.0s)]
*  And while it's happening, we're getting dumber. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6552.0s)]
*  We're getting dumber and more isolated in echo chambers. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6555.0s)]
*  And then there's this thing that they're developing [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6558.0s)]
*  that may or may not already be alive. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6561.0s)]
*  Is it? Right. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6564.0s)]
*  But maybe is there any chance it's good? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6566.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any chance it's good for us. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6568.0s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6571.0s)]
*  If we are evolving, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6572.0s)]
*  and I think evolution's real, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6574.0s)]
*  but I do think it's limited by biology. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6576.0s)]
*  In a time span, we can't get that good that quick. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6578.0s)]
*  It's pretty remarkable how much things do evolve [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6582.0s)]
*  and how quickly they actually evolve, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6585.0s)]
*  but not enough to keep up with technology, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6587.0s)]
*  because our technology's in this crazy fever pitch [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6589.0s)]
*  where you're sending videos through the sky [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6592.0s)]
*  to people in New Zealand. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6594.0s)]
*  It's wild shit. It's wild. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6596.0s)]
*  And it's only getting better. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6598.0s)]
*  They've got that new Google headset [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6600.0s)]
*  that allows you to ask questions online [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6602.0s)]
*  just using your brain. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6605.0s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6607.0s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6609.0s)]
*  This guy's operating a fucking computer [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6610.0s)]
*  just using his brain. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6612.0s)]
*  So it's going to be the next 10 years is terrifying. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6614.0s)]
*  Or wild, just fun. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6617.0s)]
*  Or great. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6619.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's terrifying. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6621.0s)]
*  What's terrifying is, to me, the collapse of society. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6623.0s)]
*  What's terrifying is these homeless encampments. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6625.0s)]
*  What's terrifying is the mental health problems that people have. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6627.0s)]
*  But what if we gave the homeless people the Google glasses? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6630.0s)]
*  Yeah, and think they're in a better place. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6634.0s)]
*  Then they don't know they're homeless. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6636.0s)]
*  Those are the first people that connect to the matrix. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6638.0s)]
*  That's a lot cheaper than a house. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6640.0s)]
*  Boom, and you're home. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6642.0s)]
*  I do think we're going to need technological innovations [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6644.0s)]
*  to deal with the crumbling cities, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6646.0s)]
*  and we might have to start getting creative. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6648.0s)]
*  Do you think aliens are real? [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6650.0s)]
*  You know, probably, but I've never been super interested in it [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6652.0s)]
*  because I think they look at us like ants. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6655.0s)]
*  Right, but ants are interesting. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6659.0s)]
*  We do a lot of research on ants. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6661.0s)]
*  Every time I see one, I call someone. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6663.0s)]
*  In fact, I come in and spray it. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6665.0s)]
*  I have leaf cutter ants that are decimated. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6667.0s)]
*  The fire ants are tough here. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6669.0s)]
*  Ooh, they got me. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6671.0s)]
*  Want to see my foot? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6673.0s)]
*  What happened? Did it hurt you? [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6675.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck me up. I stepped barefoot. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6677.0s)]
*  On a mound of fire ants? [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6679.0s)]
*  Maybe AI could help this. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6681.0s)]
*  Yeah, nope. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6683.0s)]
*  If AI can regulate sharks, I'm fine with that. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6685.0s)]
*  This is L.I. It's Lesser Intelligence. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6687.0s)]
*  When you're walking around barefoot [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6689.0s)]
*  in fire ant country like an asshole outside, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6691.0s)]
*  and you don't realize that you're getting bit until, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6695.0s)]
*  like, I probably got bit 15, 20 times. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6699.0s)]
*  My foot got fucked up, son. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6702.0s)]
*  And for me, for whatever reason, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6704.0s)]
*  whenever I get bit by fire ants, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6706.0s)]
*  my foot swells up. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6709.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6711.0s)]
*  Let me see if we can find it. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6713.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6715.0s)]
*  No, no. It's interesting to me that [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6717.0s)]
*  we're confronting all these things now. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6719.0s)]
*  It's going to be interesting because we really don't know [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6721.0s)]
*  what's going to happen. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6723.0s)]
*  No, we have no idea. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6725.0s)]
*  It's exciting and it's fun, and you just got to kind of [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6727.0s)]
*  embrace it and roll with the punches. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6729.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people working on that stuff. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6731.0s)]
*  A lot of people diligently work on that stuff. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6733.0s)]
*  It's coming. They want it to happen, whatever it is. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6735.0s)]
*  I'm not going to find it. I don't have too many [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6737.0s)]
*  goddamn photos. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6739.0s)]
*  You got to just deal with the changing landscape of [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6741.0s)]
*  who will enslave you. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6743.0s)]
*  There it is. Look at my foot. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6745.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Fire ants? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6747.0s)]
*  It was like a balloon. I had to play pool with my shoes off. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6749.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6751.0s)]
*  My foot was jammed in my shoe. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6753.0s)]
*  And then my health care professional told me to [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6755.0s)]
*  put on some, like, converse, like All Stars, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6759.0s)]
*  where you can pull them tight, lacy tight, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6761.0s)]
*  and actually it would help with the swelling, [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6763.0s)]
*  and I did. And it went away the next day. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6765.0s)]
*  I was fine. But I got nervous right there. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6767.0s)]
*  Maybe this AI thing is actually good. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6769.0s)]
*  Maybe this is actually going to be a good thing for everybody. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6771.0s)]
*  It could be good in the sense that it elevates us out of [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6775.0s)]
*  this fucking primal chimpanzee state that we're all in. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6779.0s)]
*  Yeah, this weird and tribal primitive human mindset [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6783.0s)]
*  that we still carry around. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6787.0s)]
*  I'll advertise it too. I'll take money. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6789.0s)]
*  Like, if any of these companies want to advertise on my show, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6791.0s)]
*  I'll advertise. I'll advertise. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6793.0s)]
*  You know, give me money and I'll tell people how good it's going to be. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6795.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'll tell them how good it's going to be. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6797.0s)]
*  You don't need a job. Come on, man. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6799.0s)]
*  You don't need a job. In fact, once you don't have a job, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6801.0s)]
*  you can really see what your potential is. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6803.0s)]
*  And the thing is, it's like the people who promoted the vaccine, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6805.0s)]
*  even if it didn't work, nobody holds you accountable. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6807.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6809.0s)]
*  If you promoted it, you're allowed. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6811.0s)]
*  It worked because here's what it did do. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6813.0s)]
*  It made people a trillion dollars. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6815.0s)]
*  That's not nothing. It definitely worked there. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6817.0s)]
*  That's not nothing. And with the robot things, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6819.0s)]
*  it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, humans aren't in control. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6821.0s)]
*  Yeah. But look, there's zero crime. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6823.0s)]
*  Here's the reality. If I was Pfizer, the CEO of Pfizer, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6825.0s)]
*  I'd be like, do you people not like boats? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6827.0s)]
*  Because I got a banging boat. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6829.0s)]
*  So what the fuck's your problem? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6831.0s)]
*  I saw a boat today [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6833.0s)]
*  where they have a helicopter [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6835.0s)]
*  that folds down [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6837.0s)]
*  into the boat. Yeah. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6839.0s)]
*  Do you know how much money you have to have to have a helicopter [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6841.0s)]
*  that talks away? It's crazy. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6843.0s)]
*  Crazy. When you go, like, if you ever take a trip [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6845.0s)]
*  to the Amalfi Coast, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6847.0s)]
*  you see these fucking boats out there. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6849.0s)]
*  Steve Jobs' yacht was out there. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6851.0s)]
*  It's a giant Apple store. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6853.0s)]
*  Yeah. A giant floating [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6855.0s)]
*  Apple store. It's amazing. Check this out. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6857.0s)]
*  Look at this helicopter. This is crazy. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6859.0s)]
*  It stores away in his boat. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6861.0s)]
*  This dude literally has [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6863.0s)]
*  a floating island. I had [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6865.0s)]
*  Andrew Schultz, I was texting him. He was in the Amalfi Coast. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6867.0s)]
*  He goes on these amazing vacations and I had my family [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6869.0s)]
*  at my house on Long Island. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6871.0s)]
*  And then he would be at the Amalfi Coast and I would just send him [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6873.0s)]
*  a photo of my aunt complaining about the [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6875.0s)]
*  bugs. There's so many bugs. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6877.0s)]
*  Why? You know? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6879.0s)]
*  That's better for comedy, though. It's better for comedy. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6881.0s)]
*  The Amalfi Coast is probably not funny, I guess. I don't know. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6883.0s)]
*  But I want to go. Zero funny. You have to completely [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6885.0s)]
*  restart your funny. I do want to go. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6887.0s)]

*  like what's going on today with [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6963.0s)]
*  the right and the left. And with them it was [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6965.0s)]
*  very transparent because people hadn't [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6967.0s)]
*  realized to insult your... [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6969.0s)]
*  to use ad hominins and to insult [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6971.0s)]
*  each other. But they were much more intellectual. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6973.0s)]
*  Both of them. They were very intellectual but [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6975.0s)]
*  also very combative. Compared to what we have [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6977.0s)]
*  now, I mean they were much [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6979.0s)]
*  more intellectual. And then, you know, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6981.0s)]
*  William F. Buckley lost his [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6983.0s)]
*  cool. Yeah. And [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6985.0s)]
*  said something [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6987.0s)]
*  to him. See if you could find it. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6989.0s)]
*  Didn't he smack him or something? [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6991.0s)]
*  William F. Buckley smacked him. He said he would [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6993.0s)]
*  sock him. Sock him or [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6995.0s)]
*  something? Did he call him a queer? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6997.0s)]
*  I think he called him a queer or something like that. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=6999.0s)]
*  You queer. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7001.0s)]
*  He did it in like that old [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7003.0s)]
*  English accent. It was still very proper. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7005.0s)]
*  He's like, I'll sock you, you queer. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7007.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were insulting each other. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7009.0s)]
*  But it was like a high art when they [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7011.0s)]
*  did it. Well, they were fucking... [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7013.0s)]
*  It was very combative. Crypto-Nazi. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7015.0s)]
*  Crypto-Nazi. That's right. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7017.0s)]
*  Buckley... That's right. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7019.0s)]
*  Because Gore Vidal called him a crypto-Nazi. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7021.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7047.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7093.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7095.0s)]
*  We haven't had a debate like that [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7097.0s)]
*  in a year. Literally, our debates [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7099.0s)]
*  have degenerated into people on Twitter [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7101.0s)]
*  Groomer Nazi groomer Nazi groomer. I mean this is like at least these people are at least like [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7103.0s)]
*  functioning intellectuals [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7109.66s)]
*  There's zero likelihood that guy could throw a good right hand who William F Buckley that was a you don't think so [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7111.48s)]
*  He lost his cool. He lost his cool. He lost his cool. He lost his cool [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7117.5s)]
*  But they were you know, they were insulting each other while disagreeing with the debate was like a like an art form at that point [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7121.74s)]
*  It is you know, it's a thing though that I really feel like [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7128.2s)]
*  The way to like I've seen people do it in debates where they have three minutes to state a case like I watched the monk [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7134.0599999999995s)]
*  Debates recently I watched this one with [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7138.9s)]
*  Douglas Murray and Malcolm Gladwell and a couple other people and [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7142.12s)]
*  Oh Matt Ty B was in it too and some woman I forgot her name [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7148.08s)]
*  I'm sorry [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7151.62s)]
*  But you have like three minutes to say something and then there's a rebuttal and that's three minutes and then [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7152.28s)]
*  Sometimes they interrupt each other and sometimes it broke out into a conversation, but that's what I wanted [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7159.8s)]
*  Right. I wanted a conversation like this idea that you should have three minutes [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7164.599999999999s)]
*  Like how about just give someone three minutes? [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7169.46s)]
*  like if you just you don't want anybody to dominate the conversation not let other other people speak their point of view, but if [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7171.94s)]
*  You could just like agree to like a gentleman's agreement [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7177.5199999999995s)]
*  It's sort of like when people agree when they're sparring we're not gonna wail on each other [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7181.4s)]
*  Let's just go in here and try with good faith, right? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7184.48s)]
*  You lay out what you think is correct [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7188.96s)]
*  And I'll lay out my beliefs and we'll try to figure out why I believe what I believe and you believe what you believe [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7191.2s)]
*  Detached as a human from the the problem is we don't do that [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7197.32s)]
*  We attach ourselves to every fucking idea we have whether it's ideas about [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7200.799999999999s)]
*  Our ideas about social situations or money or capitalism we attach ourselves to these ideas [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7206.0s)]
*  Yes, and we defend them and they are a part of our identity [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7212.040000000001s)]
*  That's where things get squirrely with people because you're so fucking tribal we get attached to [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7215.400000000001s)]
*  Ideologies that support this thing that we think of as us as our worldview and sometimes people switch [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7221.56s)]
*  Then you know, I'm those fucking lefties. I got red pill during the pandemic [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7227.84s)]
*  And now I fucking have a frog flag in my living room and it's people I think it's the desire for community [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7231.72s)]
*  it's the desire for [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7238.52s)]
*  You know some type of social standing and yeah people wanna [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7240.56s)]
*  You know, we're lucky enough to have a thing that we like doing that which challenging that we can do all the time [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7244.360000000001s)]
*  That there's never an end to it. You can always get better at it [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7249.8s)]
*  You can always look at something and go I wish that came out better and this was better and I think that's a lucky thing [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7252.68s)]

*  Into that vacuum can get thrown all kinds of [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7277.959999999999s)]
*  Things and well a lot of people during the pandemic used it for good, right? They started a script [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7282.12s)]
*  They decided to start a workout routine and change their diet [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7287.68s)]
*  They picked up skills the language but not everybody has that mindset and some people wallowed in Twitter [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7291.6s)]

*  But like the way I think now versus even the way I thought four years ago has changed dramatically, right? [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7350.12s)]
*  Because like so much happened in that period of time so many new [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7355.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, you know ways to think about things so many new [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7361.68s)]
*  Weird things happen that you were like, oh the things that you thought were impossible became possible [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7366.84s)]
*  Yeah, the horror movie scenarios in your head that you had cooked up became reality, right? Right all these things [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7373.12s)]
*  So, you know, it's it's definitely weird [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7379.72s)]
*  That there are people that you know [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7383.24s)]
*  You know never lived during this time and had no idea that any of the things that we went through were even really possible [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7386.96s)]
*  And then kids like people will forget about it like people that were too [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7394.8s)]
*  During the pandemic might always trust the government [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7400.18s)]
*  Because they never lived through like this time of like massive government overreach and really sloppy [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7403.7s)]
*  science and like private and public fuckery like this weird unity between the private and the public sector and [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7410.42s)]
*  It's large profit-making institutions and all this stuff [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7417.5s)]
*  So if you didn't live through it, you meant you'll never appreciate it for how wild it was and how insane it was [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7420.78s)]
*  Do you know that there is a lot of people that are saying that their children have [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7427.68s)]
*  impaired speech [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7434.72s)]
*  Because they during the pandemic they made them wear masks all the time interesting [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7436.96s)]
*  There's like even if it's a certain percentage of the time when you're talking to someone when you're a child [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7441.360000000001s)]
*  Apparently we should Google this to make sure it's true [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7447.04s)]
*  But I believe what they think is that as you're talking to someone and you're reading their lips [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7449.76s)]
*  There's like a thing going on we see their expression and you get to read faces [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7455.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow get to learn how to read people and that this is a very critical part of development when you're a child for sure [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7459.8s)]
*  and if you're exposed to even a [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7466.44s)]
*  You know even a small percentage I would imagine of your interactions or with people with shielded faces [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7468.36s)]
*  You're not gonna get any data from that [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7473.36s)]
*  You're gonna get this weird [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7476.0s)]
*  like thing [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7478.0s)]
*  Masks can be detrimental to baby speech and language development the good news is parents can take action to compensate [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7479.84s)]
*  Well, I hope that's true. Oh, yeah compensate my fear would be that there's certain stages where babies learn things [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7486.360000000001s)]
*  Where you know that they're sort of developmental stages and if that's one of them where like when they're really learning how to [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7494.08s)]
*  Form their first words and have conversations with parents that they're not seeing mouths and not seeing faces that seems [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7501.400000000001s)]
*  It's crazy and now that we find out that did didn't work. The whole thing is so insane [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7509.28s)]
*  There was a study recently see if you could find this because we brought this up the other day [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7514.28s)]
*  But we never googled it that wearing an n95 mask. You should never wear one for more than an hour a day [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7517.5s)]
*  Yeah [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7523.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, there's a lot of stuff that's gonna come out now. That'll be the complete opposite of what we were told to do [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7524.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's apparently some other health risks that can come from wearing one of those of course all the time [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7530.42s)]
*  I would imagine if it's hot out. Yeah, you're spitting into this fuck [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7536.38s)]
*  I mean just like I remember during you know, this whole thing yet [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7539.68s)]

*  The people that would started this app were very open about what they were gonna do [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7549.3s)]
*  They were like we're gonna take 20 kids make them famous make them icons because we think in the early stages of any social media [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7552.42s)]
*  App having majorly famous people on it brings more people into it, right? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7559.18s)]
*  So these kids that were just running around LA got famous because somewhere in a room and like Shanghai or Beijing [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7563.3s)]

*  There's strange time where a lot of things were changing and all these all of the technology had [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=7615.94s)]

*  But yeah, it's probably fucks you up because that's why you're getting so much co2 because the thing about those [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8061.839999999999s)]
*  N95 not just n95s the thing about specifically like surgical masks [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8067.839999999999s)]

*  And it captures some of the the stuff. Yeah, it stops some of it from getting in [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8104.68s)]
*  Yeah, so they might have a beneficial effect, but like, you know, it's a lot [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8110.280000000001s)]

*  Yeah, is they just manipulate these diseases to make them more dangerous so they can get more money [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8218.619999999999s)]
*  That's what it is for funding. Yeah, and obviously they didn't have a fucking cure. Yeah, right [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8223.38s)]

*  Well, the first thought that was like we're gonna genetically engineer mosquitoes that can't carry malaria that will save so many lives [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8273.560000000001s)]

*  Anopheles mosquito bites a person. This is the only type of mosquito that can spread malaria [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8571.76s)]
*  The mosquito becomes infected by biting an infected person drawing blood that contains the parasite [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8576.36s)]
*  When that mosquito bites another person that person becomes infected. I friend Justin got malaria three times [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8581.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's the guy for the fight for the forgotten with the well. He got malaria and then it came back [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=8587.52s)]

*  I don't think it's [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9219.3s)]
*  A common thing [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9221.06s)]
*  But I think if I had to do lizzo's dance routines every night, I would be shitting myself [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9222.74s)]
*  It happens you'd be shitting yourself and be grateful [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9227.38s)]

*  But I have to use the restroom, but it would be so funny to me if one of them said hey, I gotta use a [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9239.3s)]
*  Bathroom and lizzo just went at them like a grizzly and said fuck you [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9244.1s)]
*  Keep dancing it in and they just dance and shit themselves [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9248.66s)]
*  Do you ever like about to go on stage and you're wondering if you just take a shit? [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9251.939999999999s)]
*  I always use the bathroom before I go on stage and I make it a point too because I know [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9255.7s)]
*  That that's a possibility, but i've had moments where I wasn't sure and then if I should and then I just dump truck [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9260.02s)]
*  Yeah, just like a load of lumber. There's like before you go on stage. There's like a anxiety [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9266.34s)]
*  Sometimes your stomach a little bit and then that going, you know going to the bathroom is [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9270.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that was that girl. Yeah, let her take a shit. Maybe she could perform better. Yeah, it's a it's a beautiful [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9275.78s)]
*  Situation there with when you have people that are really overweight dancing and shitting themselves on stage [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9282.34s)]
*  It's it's that's what progress is. Yeah, but I don't think you could blame someone when you shit yourself. You really can't [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9289.7s)]
*  Well, you can't but you really can't well if you're a more there's lawyers disagreeing with you [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9297.140000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's a lot of lawyers. I don't know about that [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9302.5s)]
*  Yeah, because unless they specifically told you you can't leave to take a shit [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9305.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, unless they specifically told her that I think she internalized it and she decided to shit herself [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9309.78s)]
*  Which to me is like guys come on. You have to be grow up [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9315.300000000001s)]
*  Well on the other hand though, if they did discourage them from using the bathroom human beings have to use the bathroom, right? [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9319.7s)]
*  That's ridiculous, especially they're rehearsing [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9325.060000000001s)]
*  Like let her take a shit in between takes. Yeah, but also like I do respect if liz. I was like don't fucking use the bathroom on this tour [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9328.18s)]

*  It's just i'm sorry, but that makes me happy. Are we sure that's true? I don't think it's true at all [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9349.94s)]

*  And a judge having to look at all these fat people in a courtroom and go wait, who's what what's who's the problem? [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9360.34s)]
*  Is fat privilege or fat people allowed to call other people fat? Is that okay? It should be kind of okay [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9366.1s)]
*  But if you're if she's your boss, obviously, it's like a problem problem, but it's just funny to me [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9371.62s)]
*  Let's take morality out of it. There's nothing funnier than that. Right just liz walking around stage calling people fat [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9377.54s)]
*  I mean, it's just so funny [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9383.220000000001s)]
*  It's an absurd world well, there's a thing that happens to people when they get their own show [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9385.38s)]
*  Yeah, they've never had a show before some of them go loony right rozanne talks about it real openly. She went loony [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9390.42s)]

*  You could just fire people on a whim, you know, you want you want to be feared [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9424.98s)]
*  Well, I think it was like part of it was like lizzo was like [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9428.82s)]
*  These girls were they're like her too. It's weird [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9432.58s)]

*  And that that might be another layer of weirdness too. Didn't you ever watch that new jersey reality show? What's that called jersey shore? [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9440.259999999998s)]

*  Well, they and then they try to figure out a way to keep the ball rolling because they also got famous kind of a scam [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9501.3s)]
*  Right reality tv is kind of a little bit of skin. It's not like they worked on a craft, right? [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9506.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of a scam. So they're like, oh that will just let's apply that to everything in my life [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9509.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, let's apply that to every single thing ever and they got through right? They actually made it on television, right? [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9514.02s)]

*  They were there. They were close and then they got to figure out how to get on it [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9524.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and then they maybe the real thing is like start their own right? [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=9527.54s)]

*  too because like [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10602.58s)]
*  The compulsion. Yes to do drugs is similar to the compulsion to keep doing comedy [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10604.34s)]
*  Or to keep doing something when it's not working and getting it to work eventually [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10610.18s)]

*  But if you come from being a drug addict where you're like, yeah [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10632.58s)]
*  I used to go and do drugs and I would drive to get drugs and you know, I would [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10635.619999999999s)]

*  To do something over and over and over again [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10645.46s)]
*  and that [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10648.019999999999s)]
*  inhibits [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10649.699999999999s)]
*  A lot of normal people who from being comedians or whatever they want to be [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10650.9s)]
*  Because like when I started a podcast no one cared I just keep fucking doing it [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10655.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I was doing it myself and it was like when you you're talking to no one and then there's a small audience [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10659.939999999999s)]
*  It got bigger and bigger and bigger [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10665.539999999999s)]
*  But like the what made me keep doing it is the same part of my brain that made me keep doing drugs. Yeah [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10666.82s)]
*  It was the same type of compulsive thing. Yeah interesting. Yeah, that's your superpower [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10675.06s)]
*  Yeah, your ability to just bore down and keep doing something over and over and over again until you get better at it [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10680.66s)]
*  It's a lot of comics, right? [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=10685.94s)]

*  There's something weirder about the person in the bar sober having a lot of fun [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=11137.22s)]
*  That's weirder. That is weird. The person who's like, ah [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9juJuqrJc&t=11141.38s)]
