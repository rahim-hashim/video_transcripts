# Joe Rogan Experience #2267 - Dan Richards
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello, what's happening? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10.0s)]
*  Good to see you again, man. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=12.0s)]
*  Good to see you too, Joe. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=14.0s)]
*  Thanks for the invite. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=15.0s)]
*  Oh, my pleasure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=16.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming on here, man. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=17.0s)]
*  I really enjoy your videos. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=18.0s)]
*  Your website, your channel, rather on YouTube, D-Dunking, is, it's really great because it's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=19.0s)]
*  so obvious, like, it's one of those things where you don't need, like, some big crazy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=28.0s)]
*  set or high production values to make something interesting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=34.0s)]
*  It's just you with a bookshelf behind you talking about stuff, and it's great. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=38.0s)]
*  Well, thanks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=42.0s)]
*  I appreciate that, Joe. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=43.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very passionate about this stuff, so it's, I'm glad that people are taking notice [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=44.0s)]
*  and that I'm sitting here talking to you right now, but it's crazy to me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=49.0s)]
*  Well, you were one of the, you, like me, were one of the early readers of Fingerprints of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=52.0s)]
*  the Gods, and that's sort of how you got into this whole subject, right? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=58.0s)]
*  Yes, I actually had that one pre-ordered from Hastings because I'd read the sign in the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=62.0s)]
*  seal, and so I was already like, Graham Hancock's pretty cool. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=67.0s)]
*  I like the way he's coming at these things, and I saw that there was a thing at Hastings [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=71.0s)]
*  to pre-order Fingerprints of the Gods for, like, 25 bucks or something. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=77.0s)]
*  So you get like $3 off, and so I did and was reading it cover to cover when I had Graham [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=80.0s)]
*  sign it and him and Santa both were just looking at how beat the hell it is, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=84.0s)]
*  Because he'd been in a construction truck where we were going job sites for like 20 years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=88.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=92.0s)]
*  So the sign in the seal, was that about Ethiopia? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=93.0s)]
*  The Ark of the Covenant? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=99.0s)]
*  What's your take on all that? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=100.0s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=101.0s)]
*  Anytime they won't let you see the evidence, I get, like, all of my alarm bells go off, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=102.0s)]
*  right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=106.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=107.0s)]
*  I understand why they wouldn't want you to see it if it really is the Ark. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=108.0s)]
*  I'd like to see, I guess the best thing we could do to test it without seeing the Ark [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=112.0s)]
*  would be to look into the claims that these guys go blind and they show signs of radiation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=116.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's explain to everybody what the claim, that they believe that this one church [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=121.0s)]
*  in Ethiopia actually possesses the Ark of the Covenant, and that these priests that are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=126.0s)]
*  supposedly guarding this, they all exhibit signs of radiation poisoning. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=131.0s)]
*  Yes, they all just exhibit signs of radiation poisoning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=136.0s)]
*  They go blind, they die quickly, and then somebody else, one priest at a time, is allowed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=139.0s)]
*  to be, like, the caretaker of the Ark. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=143.0s)]
*  How long do they live? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=145.0s)]
*  They want to say, like, a couple years, something like that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=147.0s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=149.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=150.0s)]
*  It's been not very long, yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=151.0s)]
*  They die pretty quick. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=152.0s)]
*  Imagine that job. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=153.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=154.0s)]
*  You get that call. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=156.0s)]
*  They're like, how much do I love Jesus? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=157.0s)]
*  I want to get radiation poisoning? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=159.0s)]
*  This is kind of fucking crazy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=162.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a, but there's a lot of evidence in that book that was really interesting, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=164.0s)]
*  like the Knights Templar statues and stuff, and in old Paris cathedrals that would lead [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=169.0s)]
*  Graham to Ethiopia, just all kinds of weird stuff that made it really interesting, little [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=178.0s)]
*  Indiana Jones, man. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=184.0s)]
*  It's like real life kind of Indiana Jones shit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=185.0s)]
*  And so I was just anxious for that fingerprint. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=188.0s)]
*  Well, something that has that much radiation that kills people so quickly, wouldn't that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=190.0s)]
*  be something that you could measure from outside of the church? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=196.0s)]
*  You would think that our boys would be all over that shit with the satellites and be [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=200.0s)]
*  like, yeah, that's a spot to watch out for. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=204.0s)]
*  Send a team. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=206.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=207.0s)]
*  Because that was one of the speculations about the New Jersey drones, which was really weird, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=208.0s)]
*  was that there was, allegedly, this is part of the speculation, allegedly, there was a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=213.0s)]
*  warhead that was missing from when, what was it, from Ukraine? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=218.0s)]
*  I think it was from quite a while ago. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=224.0s)]
*  So there was a warhead that was not accounted for, a nuclear warhead. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=228.0s)]
*  And the thought was that somehow or another it had gotten snuck into the United States. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=232.0s)]
*  And these drones had the capability to scan for gamma radiation, and that they were looking [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=238.0s)]
*  for excess gamma radiation, which would indicate that this thing was there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=245.0s)]
*  That would make sense. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=250.0s)]
*  I saw that on Twitter. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=251.0s)]
*  I saw a few guys talking about it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=252.0s)]
*  It would definitely make sense. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=254.0s)]
*  It's weird that the drones just kind of stopped around Christmas time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=255.0s)]
*  Well, not only did they stop, but there was also this, I don't even, I hesitate to even [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=258.0s)]
*  talk about this because so much of this is horseshit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=264.0s)]
*  But there was a lot of speculation on Twitter that there was something that broke up in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=267.0s)]
*  the atmosphere. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=271.0s)]
*  And the conspiracy was that this was a Chinese satellite that was controlling those drones. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=272.0s)]
*  And then the Trump administration recently said, no, they are our drones. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=279.0s)]
*  I mean, okay, why wouldn't you fucking tell us that they were our drones? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=284.0s)]
*  You're just flying a bunch of SUV sized drones over New Jersey for weeks at a time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=288.0s)]
*  There had to be some reason. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=296.0s)]
*  What was going on? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=297.0s)]
*  And how, you know, I get, you know, I get you can't tell us everything. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=298.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=302.0s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=303.0s)]
*  They just stopped at the Christmas time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=304.0s)]
*  I was kind of worried about that because I went to see Mark Gagnon in Brooklyn. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=306.0s)]
*  I just was there last week and I was like, man, I hope I don't see a bunch of dang drones [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=312.0s)]
*  in the sky and stuff still. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=315.0s)]
*  But because I've had that booked out for a couple of months. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=316.0s)]
*  But yeah, my friend Mark saw one. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=318.0s)]
*  Mark Norman, he saw one. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=319.0s)]
*  He said it was huge. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=320.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=321.0s)]
*  He said it was really big and it moved really fast. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=322.0s)]
*  And he said it had propellers, but it didn't sound like a regular helicopter. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=324.0s)]
*  So it was real weird. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=328.0s)]
*  I saw a lot of videos of them and I saw a few guys talking about them that seemed somewhat [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=329.0s)]
*  credible on Twitter. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=333.0s)]
*  But I didn't see that like guys that had talked about being weapons developers and stuff like [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=334.0s)]
*  that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=339.0s)]
*  But it's so easy nowadays to just bullshit your way through things and there's money [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=340.0s)]
*  in it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=345.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=346.0s)]
*  I mean, you get clicks. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=347.0s)]
*  So it's like there's the days of it needing to be a government conspiracy in my mind are [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=348.0s)]
*  like way long gone. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=352.0s)]
*  There's if I pretend I see Bigfoot and I fake it good enough to get a bunch of to get on [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=353.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=358.0s)]
*  Well, man, I'm doing pretty fucking good now. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can make some money. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=361.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=362.0s)]
*  So that is a real problem. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=363.0s)]
*  I'm really skeptical of like everybody. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=364.0s)]
*  Now, it's like treat them all like crackheads. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=365.0s)]
*  I am too. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=367.0s)]
*  And I like that about your channel that you are quite skeptical about a lot of things, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=368.0s)]
*  even things that the people that are heretics of the archaeological world, they subscribe [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=373.0s)]
*  to and you're like, not so fast. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=379.0s)]
*  Which I think is great. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=381.0s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=382.0s)]
*  But getting back to the Ethiopia thing, if we have this capability supposedly to scan [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=384.0s)]
*  for gamma radiation from the sky, why wouldn't someone fly over that church and go, yo, there's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=390.0s)]
*  a crazy hot spot here? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=395.0s)]
*  You would think probably somebody has. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=397.0s)]
*  If not, like I was saying with the satellites, in all honesty, the feds monitor that kind [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=399.0s)]
*  of shit like heavily. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=405.0s)]
*  So, I mean, if it's possible that it wouldn't be, you know, any kind of weapons, grady stuff. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=407.0s)]
*  So they might just not be looking for that particularly. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=412.0s)]
*  Can they monitor for gamma radiation from satellites? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=415.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=417.0s)]
*  I know that they can look for. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=418.0s)]
*  I know they can look for. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=420.0s)]
*  I'm not sure how they detect. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=421.0s)]
*  I'm not sure what they used to detect it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=422.0s)]
*  But I know that they can look for radioactive material from space. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=424.0s)]
*  So the thought is that if this Ark of the Covenant is there and whatever it is, is somehow [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=428.0s)]
*  radioactive, is there any sort of theory as to how they develop some sort of radioactive thing? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=436.0s)]
*  Like what is it supposed to be? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=444.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not a reactor. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=446.0s)]
*  It's in a box. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=449.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=450.0s)]
*  Like what is it? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=451.0s)]
*  Well, this episode is brought to you by BetterHelp. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=452.0s)]
*  People like to throw around all these red flags, you know, things someone says or does that you [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=456.0s)]
*  don't like, which is fine. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=461.0s)]
*  But instead of focusing on the negative all the time, why don't we focus on the positive? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=463.0s)]
*  If you're looking for a romantic partner, think about what traits you like to see in a person. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=468.0s)]
*  If you like to work out and stay in shape, you might want to find someone who's also health conscious. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=473.0s)]
*  Or if you like to travel, you probably want to find someone who's just as adventurous. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=478.0s)]
*  Now, once you're in a relationship, it's a whole different ballgame and things aren't always going to be perfect. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=483.0s)]
*  But that's what therapy is for. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=489.0s)]
*  Therapy is an excellent way to work through any problems, even the small ones. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=491.0s)]
*  Like say you and a loved one have been fighting a lot lately, but you still really want to make things work. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=494.0s)]
*  Therapy can serve as a mediary. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=499.0s)]
*  It can help you identify the problem and teach you positive ways to address it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=501.0s)]

*  The theory that a lot of people have is that it's a weapon that like in the Bible, it's described like shooting lightning and things like that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=538.0s)]
*  And what Graham mentions in the book, it's an interesting point, is the Bible records Moses going up to Mount Sinai, coming down with the Ten Commandments, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=545.0s)]
*  getting mad at the Israelites worshipping a golden calf, and he breaks the Ten Commandments and then goes back up the mountain and comes back down after another week or so with the Ten Commandments again. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=554.0s)]
*  And Graham points out that this could be a memory of him going up and getting the wrong stone, and then, damn it, smashes it, goes back and finds the right stone that he's lost. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=565.0s)]
*  He finds the right stone that he's looking for that it had the proper, you know, uranium rich or whatever speculative radiation stuff. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=574.0s)]
*  So but inside of the box, the popular theory is, you know, you got metal, wood, metal, like a transformer. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=581.0s)]
*  And so the popular theory is it's a way to generate electricity and would also describe like the way that guys in the Bible are if they if they touch it, they have to carry it with sticks. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=588.0s)]
*  And if they touch it, even to steady it, they get killed and stuff. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=597.0s)]
*  But I honestly I don't see it being a transformer that wood metal or metal wood metal thing has to be stacked. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=600.0s)]
*  You're not just getting it with one layer like the Bible describes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=606.0s)]
*  But it's an interesting thing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=609.0s)]
*  You say it has to be stacked, you mean spaced in between each layer? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=611.0s)]
*  Yeah, like if you've ever seen a doorbell transformer. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=615.0s)]
*  No. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=618.0s)]
*  OK, transformers at the bottom of it will have multiple plates. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=619.0s)]
*  It'll be like a plate of metal and then a plate of silicone or something like that, too, that's conductive, nonconductive, conductive, nonconductive. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=623.0s)]
*  And there'll be multiples of those. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=630.0s)]
*  And this is part of the electromagnetic changing of the because what a transformer does is it steps electricity up or down and swaps voltage for amperage, basically. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=632.0s)]
*  So the metal plates are part of it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=641.0s)]
*  So the idea is that this thing would collect electricity inside the box and then the Israelites would use it to throw lightning at the enemies. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=644.0s)]
*  Now, there's still a lot of speculation as to how the box would work. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=652.0s)]
*  But Moses was also said to after going up and seeing God, he was said to have had to cover his face with the cloth for the rest of his life, life because it was shown. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=656.0s)]
*  And Graham speculated in that book that it might be because of radiation sickness or something. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=666.0s)]
*  His face was covered in sores for the rest of his life. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=670.0s)]
*  So it is interesting. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=673.0s)]
*  So if this thing is radioactive, like how would that conduct electricity? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=675.0s)]
*  No idea. It would probably be if it was it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=683.0s)]
*  Maybe it's the power source like we have radioactive batteries on satellites and shit. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=688.0s)]
*  Right. And they convert that radiation into electricity. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=694.0s)]
*  So it's possible. I mean, that's I'm you know, I'm not really too big on the ancient high technology, but I'm always willing to speculate and look at the angles on it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=698.0s)]
*  And that's that's basically where they come from, the guys that are really big into the arc. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=706.0s)]
*  Some guys even will will claim that it's a capacitor like full on capacitor, which a capacitor stores and discharges electricity. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=711.0s)]
*  It's why we were told not to when you don't touch the tube on your TV when we were kids, it'll zap you the capacitor. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=721.0s)]
*  We're old. We remember tubes on TV. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=729.0s)]
*  I watched a friend of mine working on an arcade machine once and one of the leads popped off of the thing and he was bald and it tapped to the top and laid his ass right out straight to the ground. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=732.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. You OK? Wow. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=742.0s)]
*  But anyway, yeah, that's what a capacitor is. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=744.0s)]
*  So some guys believe like Billy Carson would would say that the Ark of the Covenant would fit inside of the sarcophagus of the King's Chamber, which it doesn't. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=747.0s)]
*  And that it's a capacitor to power the pyramid. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=756.0s)]
*  So it doesn't. How do you know that it doesn't? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=760.0s)]
*  But the Bible has the specifications for the size of the Ark of the Covenant. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=763.0s)]
*  And they're not the same as how different are they? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=768.0s)]
*  Considerably. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=771.0s)]
*  Is it larger or smaller? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=772.0s)]
*  The Ark is larger. Oh, it's larger. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=773.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=775.0s)]
*  Well, on the inside of the sarcophagus. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=776.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen the one that Donald Trump has at Mar-a-Lago? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=778.0s)]
*  No. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=780.0s)]
*  He has a recreation of the Ark of the Covenant at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=781.0s)]
*  No shit? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=784.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=785.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=786.0s)]
*  It doesn't look bigger than the reason why I said it doesn't look bigger than the sarcophagus. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=787.0s)]
*  Maybe I need to look at it again. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=792.0s)]
*  There's a possibility that I'm wrong there, but I know I know that the measurements are off by enough that it was like this isn't just a little mix and match. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=793.0s)]
*  This was it's way off. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=801.0s)]
*  I feel like we should have a recreation of the Ark of the Covenant here. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=802.0s)]
*  You probably should. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=805.0s)]
*  I probably should. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=806.0s)]
*  There's no reason. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=807.0s)]
*  Jamie, can you pull up that one? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=808.0s)]
*  Was it visiting the Mar-a-Lago? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=809.0s)]
*  I think I was trying to find a... [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=812.0s)]
*  But it's pretty dope, man. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=814.0s)]
*  It's like Indiana Jones type dope. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=816.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=818.0s)]
*  It's really cool. It looks awesome. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=819.0s)]
*  But if that's real and these guys are just guarding it and dying of radiation poison, like, hey, get some fucking better leadership and let the world know. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=821.0s)]
*  I mean, if you really want people to believe in God in the Bible, what better way than to say not only is the Ark of the Covenant real, but we have it here at this church in Ethiopia. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=829.0s)]
*  And we've been suffering for the past X hundred years. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=839.0s)]
*  I mean, how many priests have died? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=842.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=844.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=845.0s)]
*  A lot. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=846.0s)]
*  A lot. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=847.0s)]
*  That'd be a good thing to know. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=848.0s)]
*  Well, this would be... [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=850.0s)]
*  I mean, this was supposed...the Ark was supposed to have been brought there by the Queen of Sheba's son, Menelik. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=851.0s)]
*  So you're talking thousands of years, right? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=857.0s)]
*  So Ethiopia has a lot of...here it goes. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=859.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=863.0s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=864.0s)]
*  That's the one that was at Trump's place. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=865.0s)]
*  It's definitely a replica. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=866.0s)]
*  Oh, that's not the one? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=867.0s)]
*  No, no, it is. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=868.0s)]
*  It is the one? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=869.0s)]
*  Well, who knows, right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=870.0s)]
*  No one's seen it. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=871.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=872.0s)]
*  But I mean, that's not what I meant. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=873.0s)]
*  I mean, the one that's at Mar-a-Lago, there's photos of it at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=875.0s)]
*  This is the one that was at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=878.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=880.0s)]
*  See, that looks like that would fit inside the sarcophagus, doesn't it? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=881.0s)]
*  Scroll up a little, so I can see it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=883.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe I was wrong about that, but I do know... [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=885.0s)]
*  Except for the handles. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=888.0s)]
*  I do know that the measurements are off drastically. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=889.0s)]
*  It's not just an inch or two. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=892.0s)]
*  It's enough that you're not sliding one in the other. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=895.0s)]
*  Can you show a photo of it at Mar-a-Lago? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=898.0s)]
*  I know we pulled it up at one point in time. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=901.0s)]
*  Because when these folks are standing around next to it... [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=904.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're far left. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=908.0s)]
*  See? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=909.0s)]
*  See, that looks like it would fit in there. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=910.0s)]
*  It does look like it would. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=912.0s)]
*  But yeah, if you look up the measurements, I wish... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=914.0s)]
*  I don't have them off the top of my head. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=917.0s)]
*  I was doing that, but it's not tracked. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=919.0s)]
*  But yeah, they are... [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=921.0s)]
*  The sarcophagus in the King's Chamber and the Ark of the Covenant are... [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=923.0s)]
*  I mean, I feel like we should send the green berets into that church. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=932.0s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=935.0s)]
*  Tell us what the fuck you got. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=936.0s)]
*  Enough of this. Enough hiding. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=938.0s)]
*  This is like... [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=941.0s)]
*  If you have that, that's something for the whole human race to know. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=942.0s)]
*  That's not something for you to hide. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=947.0s)]
*  That's not yours to covet. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=949.0s)]
*  No, well, wrong. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=951.0s)]
*  No, but if they've been hiding it forever and it's a religious icon [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=952.0s)]
*  and they're like the keepers of it or whatever... [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=958.0s)]
*  Look how big the sarcophagus is in the King's Chamber. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=961.0s)]
*  Yeah, dang. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=963.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=964.0s)]
*  The King's Chamber itself is so bananas. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=966.0s)]
*  The whole thing, like why? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=969.0s)]
*  What did you do? Why did you do it this way? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=971.0s)]
*  How did you have the resources? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=973.0s)]
*  How did you get those stones that are that big up so high? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=975.0s)]
*  Oh, man, there's so much about the pyramids in general that are just so hard to even... [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=977.0s)]
*  Like I'd mentioned a little bit last time we talked the squaring of it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=983.0s)]
*  It's like 756 feet long and there's like two to three inch variation at the most. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=987.0s)]
*  So you're talking like thousands of a percent on this massive thing. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=993.0s)]
*  And if you just stretch a rope from one end of this table to the other and hold it tight, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=998.0s)]
*  it's going to sag a little. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1001.0s)]
*  You're 756 feet. You're not getting a two inch accurate measurement at that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1003.0s)]
*  With a rope. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1007.0s)]
*  With the ropes. You have to use something different. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1008.0s)]
*  So what are you using? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1010.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1012.0s)]
*  What are you using? How are you using it? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1013.0s)]
*  How do you get 2,300,000 stones all placed within 20 years? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1015.0s)]
*  The 20 years. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1020.0s)]
*  The 20 year thing is nuts. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1021.0s)]
*  Throw that one out because that's the cynical side of things. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1022.0s)]
*  That's where they are. We have to stick to what we know, what we believe. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1026.0s)]
*  Just a couple of pharaohs before that guy built three pyramids. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1031.0s)]
*  So you can't just say, well, these guys were only building them each generation for tombs. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1035.0s)]
*  It seems to me like it's a multigenerational project. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1040.0s)]
*  If these guys were the ones that built them, like the historians say, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1043.0s)]
*  it seems to me like every generation was working on three. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1046.0s)]
*  I break ground on my grandsons. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1051.0s)]
*  I'm getting my sons going and I'm finishing mine. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1053.0s)]
*  Every generation was probably doing that because it took a hundred years to build, man. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1056.0s)]
*  They're huge. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1059.0s)]
*  The only explanation outside of that, it was some lost technology. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1064.0s)]
*  That's the only explanation. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1065.0s)]
*  The problem with the lost technology thing is where's the tools? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1066.0s)]
*  Like what would you use? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1069.0s)]
*  There is some evidence that there's some sophisticated cutting methods. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1071.0s)]
*  The coring, the drills that indicate like a very high speed drill, which is interesting. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1074.0s)]
*  So it's not just as simple as getting some tube and slowly working its way through. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1080.0s)]
*  The way it's cut into some of the granite indicates that it was done at a high speed. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1086.0s)]
*  So the question is like how, what, what was the material? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1091.0s)]
*  Where is it? What happened to it? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1094.0s)]
*  And the argument, of course, would be this is the kind of stuff that we get looted right away, right? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1097.0s)]
*  If you want to watch Mad Max and they're not running around picking up bottle caps or picking up the stuff you can use. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1103.0s)]
*  But on the flip side of that, the, you know, the evidence, you know, if you look at any one of your videos or mine that are about the pyramid, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1108.0s)]
*  you're going to have thousands of comments of people that are like, here's my theory on the pyramid. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1118.0s)]
*  And most of these are pretty mundane. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1123.0s)]
*  Most of these are, I think they might have used water to, I think we kind of need to exhaust in my mind. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1124.0s)]
*  We kind of need to exhaust all that mundane shit that people can throw at this problem before we really can start saying, OK, well, now let's let's let's just step outside of history and speculate harder. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1130.0s)]
*  I'm willing to entertain the things. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1139.0s)]
*  But if you really want to find out what happened in my mind, you kind of have to be more more grounded with it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1142.0s)]
*  That's how I look at it. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1147.0s)]
*  Well, I think if we're looking at a linear timeline between the technology that was available to people, say, 15000 years ago and today, then yeah, then you have to look at it in a more mundane way. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1148.0s)]
*  Because obviously they didn't have electricity then you're thinking obviously they didn't have diamond tip cutting tools that were made out of like some super titanium or whatever the fuck the alloy was. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1159.0s)]
*  But if we're looking at lost technology and if we're looking at the possibility of, you know, when you get into Graham Hancock stuff, specifically the younger drives impact theory, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1171.0s)]
*  which I'm always fascinated by both the people that fully support it and the people that fully dismiss it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1183.0s)]
*  Both of those things are interesting to me because you don't know. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1190.0s)]
*  Just stop. Just stop. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1193.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1194.0s)]
*  That's so accurate. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1195.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1196.0s)]
*  Shut your hole. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1197.0s)]
*  We're all just guessing. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1198.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're guessing. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1199.0s)]
*  But we're all looking at some really interesting stuff. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1200.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1202.0s)]
*  We're looking at the iridium. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1203.0s)]
*  We're we're looking at the micro diamonds, the nano diamonds. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1205.0s)]
*  We're looking at the black mat. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1209.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1211.0s)]
*  Do you know about my friend John Reeves up in Alaska, the the the bone yard in Alaska? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1212.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1218.0s)]
*  John Reeves. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1219.0s)]
*  He actually this he found this. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1220.0s)]
*  This was actually sawed. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1222.0s)]
*  This isn't that's an ancient mammoth bone. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1223.0s)]
*  The cut the piece that was cut out was how it was carbon dated. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1226.0s)]
*  And I forget what the carbon date it was. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1229.0s)]
*  It wasn't that extraordinary. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1231.0s)]
*  Hundreds of years, I think. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1233.0s)]
*  Right. It was only hundreds of years. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1235.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1236.0s)]
*  Or maybe a couple thousand. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1237.0s)]
*  I forget what it was. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1238.0s)]
*  But the fact that it was sawed at the top is very interesting because they were trying to some of the bones they've dated to tens of thousands of years, including animals that they found that they found bones of that weren't even supposed to be in this area. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1239.0s)]
*  So he has a very small piece of land. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1252.0s)]
*  He has an enormous piece of land, but a small piece of it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1254.0s)]
*  I think it's only about six acres where they're finding an enormous number of woolly mammoth bones, short faced bear, all these different lions and all these different animals. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1257.0s)]
*  That some of them they didn't even think were in Alaska 10, 15,000 years ago. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1268.0s)]
*  And there's also a thick layer of dark carbon that indicates that like something happened. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1274.0s)]
*  Like there was some sort of massive burn. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1280.0s)]
*  And the theory is that there was an enormous flood and that this was a basin where a lot of these animals that died got washed into and then covered. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1282.0s)]
*  So they have this wall that is essentially permafrost and they hose it down. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1292.0s)]
*  They do it all the time and then they see a mammoth tusk and then they slowly work their way out. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1298.0s)]
*  But he has where go to this go to his Instagram page. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1303.0s)]
*  John was about he's every year he's our last guest. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1307.0s)]
*  But this year he got pneumonia. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1310.0s)]
*  So we had a delay him until recently. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1312.0s)]
*  But this is all stuff that they find. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1315.0s)]
*  He's a gold miner. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1318.0s)]
*  So this is all stuff that they find incident on his property. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1319.0s)]
*  What started out incidentally and now they search for it. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1322.0s)]
*  But there's John right there in the middle with the baseball hat on. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1326.0s)]
*  So he the big guy right there. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1329.0s)]
*  He's a giant human. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1331.0s)]
*  So I mean you got to see him in real life. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1333.0s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1335.0s)]
*  But this area that he has is extraordinary because he's got enormous. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1336.0s)]
*  See that's how they hose it all down. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1342.0s)]
*  So he set up this multimillion dollar research facility out there. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1344.0s)]
*  He's got huge warehouses store and thousands and thousands of these bones. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1347.0s)]
*  And it's just in a six acre area. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1352.0s)]
*  And then there's another additional area that's a similar size. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1354.0s)]
*  So they could see one of the bones one of the tusks sticking out. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1357.0s)]
*  But he gave us that step bison skull that's in the lobby. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1361.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1365.0s)]
*  That's ten thousand years old. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1366.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1367.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1368.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1369.0s)]
*  And so he's got a bunch of me pulls him out left and right. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1370.0s)]
*  See if you can find like some of the bins that he has. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1372.0s)]
*  He's got these enormous like look look at all those mammoth tusks. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1375.0s)]
*  Holy just stacks of them. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1379.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1380.0s)]
*  A ton of them. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1381.0s)]
*  And they're all over the place. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1382.0s)]
*  I mean his his property is really really extraordinary. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1384.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1388.0s)]
*  But it's all his. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1389.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1390.0s)]
*  So he's like hey fuck off. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1391.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1392.0s)]
*  I'm just going to dig this stuff up myself. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1393.0s)]
*  I don't want anybody coming on lying and bullshitting and controlling the area. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1394.0s)]
*  It's on all on private land. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1399.0s)]
*  So I'm just going to keep pulling this stuff out of there and hiring people to come in [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1401.0s)]
*  and do some research on it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1404.0s)]
*  Look at all these bones I found. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1406.0s)]
*  Isn't that insane. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1407.0s)]
*  That's that's wild. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1408.0s)]
*  So that's the theory. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1410.0s)]
*  The theory is that this was an area where a lot of these animals that died probably [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1411.0s)]
*  instantaneously by the impact got washed into. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1417.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1421.0s)]
*  I could see that. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1422.0s)]
*  I mean he has a lot of fucking bones. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1423.0s)]
*  You're only getting a tiny fraction of it. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1425.0s)]
*  If you actually see it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1427.0s)]
*  See Jamie see if you can find one of the images of his warehouses like from like there's [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1428.0s)]
*  some overhead views of the warehouses. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1433.0s)]
*  They're huge and they're just filled with bones and he pulls them out every day. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1435.0s)]
*  Like whenever they want they go down there they hose down the permafrost and because [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1440.0s)]
*  it's in the permafrost it's all preserved. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1444.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1446.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1447.0s)]
*  I was just saying is permafrost is preserved real well. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1448.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1449.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1450.0s)]
*  So these are just. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1451.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1452.0s)]
*  But these are all storage bins. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1455.0s)]
*  They have filled with bones. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1456.0s)]
*  I mean it's pretty extraordinary. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1457.0s)]
*  That is wild. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1461.0s)]
*  So it's sad that he doesn't want to bring the scientists in but I can understand why. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1462.0s)]
*  It's you know the way that things are nowadays. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1466.0s)]
*  It's he doesn't trust him. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1470.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1472.0s)]
*  A lot of people don't. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1473.0s)]
*  And he wanted to come on here to like spread it out to the world. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1474.0s)]
*  One of the things that he found out was that they dumped the previous owners of his property [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1477.0s)]
*  before he owned it. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1481.0s)]
*  The. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1483.0s)]
*  What museum was it again Jamie. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1484.0s)]
*  American National History Museum in New York City had acquired some of the bones and they [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1486.0s)]
*  had so much of them that they dumped some of them in the East River. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1490.0s)]
*  Now they denied it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1494.0s)]
*  So he sent divers out to the exact spot in the East River and they started pulling up [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1495.0s)]
*  step bison bones and all these different like ancient ancient animal bones from this [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1499.0s)]
*  exact area where they said to look for it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1505.0s)]
*  So it's pretty much been confirmed that it's true and he does know that they have some [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1508.0s)]
*  of them still and they won't release them to him. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1511.0s)]
*  So until they release the bones to him that are rightfully his he's like fuck off. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1513.0s)]
*  You can't come here. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1517.0s)]
*  I can understand that. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1518.0s)]
*  But his spot in my opinion is one of the best indicators that there was a mass casualty [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1519.0s)]
*  event. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1525.0s)]
*  There was some sort of a huge catastrophe that took place that killed all of these animals. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1526.0s)]
*  Now we know that humans were around back then. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1530.0s)]
*  The question was how sophisticated were they. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1534.0s)]
*  And this is where it all gets so weird. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1537.0s)]
*  You know because I've been following this for ever and ever and ever. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1539.0s)]
*  And I was following it long before they discovered Gobekli Tepe. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1542.0s)]
*  And so the question was that the archaeologists would always the really arrogant archaeologists [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1545.0s)]
*  would always throw in the faces of these heretics. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1550.0s)]
*  They would say well if this is true where's the evidence of this ancient civilization [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1553.0s)]
*  that was so sophisticated they can make massive stone structures 10,000 years ago. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1557.0s)]
*  There is no evidence. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1561.0s)]
*  Well now there is. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1562.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1563.0s)]
*  So now they have to kind of look at it and go well okay we're wrong about that but we're [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1564.0s)]
*  still we know 2500 BC maximum that's how old the pyramids are. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1567.0s)]
*  They don't. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1573.0s)]
*  They don't. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1574.0s)]
*  A lot of the scientists most of the scientists are actually scientists. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1576.0s)]
*  But the ones that we end up seeing are the ones that are invested in creating a narrative. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1580.0s)]
*  They're the ones that they want to make sure that pseudo archaeology and pseudoscience [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1587.0s)]
*  is always on its back foot and never gets a fair day in court and blah blah blah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1592.0s)]
*  These guys they don't they don't give us any real accurate interpretation of the data. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1597.0s)]
*  They'll step way outside of their lane to tell you what's going on. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1602.0s)]
*  You mean like Flint Dibble? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1605.0s)]
*  I mean exactly like Flint Dibble. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1607.0s)]
*  Well you were the guy that broke down what he was inaccurate about when he was having [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1609.0s)]
*  that air quotes debate with Graham Hancock. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1614.0s)]
*  Well yeah it's all very unfortunate because what he does know is really interesting. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1617.0s)]
*  All that stuff about ancient seeds and stuff and how they they change over the time and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1621.0s)]
*  you know how you can tell whether a seed is domesticated versus whether it's feral. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1626.0s)]
*  Yeah oh yeah he's he's he's good at what he does at least as far as that stuff goes. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1629.0s)]
*  But like like there was another there's a guy that's a trained anthropologist that made [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1634.0s)]
*  a couple of videos about him Sam Urban from Illegitimate Scholar and he I think Graham [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1639.0s)]
*  mentioned him here before. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1644.0s)]
*  He he's a he specialized in underwater shipwrecks and he just blasted the stuff that Flint said [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1646.0s)]
*  not just the three million shipwreck he just blasted on a scientific level. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1654.0s)]
*  This is wrong this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1658.0s)]
*  Yeah he got way out of his lane with that. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1660.0s)]
*  Yeah and that's you know I that's I guess one of the biggest things here though all those guys [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1662.0s)]
*  right now are laughing well you're an electrician Dan you're outside your lane every time you [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1667.0s)]
*  talk about this shit but the difference is you're outside your lane. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1670.0s)]
*  I'm outside my lane but I'm not talking about people getting beat up or cracking jokes. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1673.0s)]
*  Yeah well only you would have a painting of you busting Shane Gillis's ass. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1678.0s)]
*  I didn't make that. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1685.0s)]
*  Every time he posts that picture he's like I had a great time on JRE I'm like man I seen [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1686.0s)]
*  that on that's a that's a beautiful work of art right. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1690.0s)]
*  It's very pretty. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1692.0s)]
*  Very pretty good painting. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1693.0s)]
*  Yeah so we're all out of our lanes. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1695.0s)]
*  Yeah with something every person who's an expert is out of their lanes with a lot of things. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1696.0s)]
*  But there's a difference and this is like what you alluded to it a minute ago where it's like [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1700.0s)]
*  there's a difference between saying we know for a fact and we're not sure. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1704.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1707.0s)]
*  And you know a common atheist argument if you talk like Richard Dawkins he'll say the minute [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1708.0s)]
*  the scientist says God did it they're not worth a fuck to me in the lab because they're not [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1712.0s)]
*  working anymore they're like I've got the answer. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1717.0s)]
*  That's the same thing as the science is settled. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1719.0s)]
*  If you say the science is done we know for a fact. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1721.0s)]
*  You can't say that. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1724.0s)]
*  You're no longer worth the fuck to me in the lab. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1725.0s)]
*  Science is not settled when you don't have all the information in the universe. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1727.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1730.0s)]
*  Since we never will. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1731.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1732.0s)]
*  Well maybe we will. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1733.0s)]

*  Future selves. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1823.0s)]
*  I mean what we're looking at is a mystery. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1824.0s)]
*  And Egypt to me is one of the most phenomenal of all the mysteries. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1826.0s)]
*  The most fascinating because whatever happened however long ago those people in Africa did [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1830.0s)]
*  something that no one's been able to do since. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1836.0s)]
*  And they did it in a way that defies our understanding not just of what they could do [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1839.0s)]
*  back then but of what people could ever do including right now. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1845.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1849.0s)]
*  And there's a lot to be said like that you can't see about ancient Egypt. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1850.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1853.0s)]
*  Like you know the Bronze Age collapse. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1854.0s)]
*  You've heard of that right. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1856.0s)]
*  And the sea peoples. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1857.0s)]
*  Egypt was like the big power that survived like all these other big powers. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1858.0s)]
*  They were destroyed. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1862.0s)]
*  They were crushed. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1863.0s)]
*  They lost everything. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1864.0s)]
*  Egypt got smaller but it survived. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1865.0s)]
*  It wasn't until the Greeks came along that it was I mean they were they'd been conquered [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1867.0s)]
*  off and on but it wasn't until the Greeks came along that they were truly subjugated. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1870.0s)]
*  And that's thousands and thousands and thousands of years. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1873.0s)]
*  And by the time the Greeks showed up that shit was so old that you look on the Osirion [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1876.0s)]
*  they say that there's graffiti that's like the sacred geometry shit that was hermeticism [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1881.0s)]
*  that was popular in Greece. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1887.0s)]
*  So they're seeing hermeticist stuff when the sacred geometry on it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1888.0s)]
*  And that's like you know thousands of years later there's their minds are blown the same [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1892.0s)]
*  as ours are today. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1896.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1897.0s)]
*  And that's that's really fucked when you think about Alexander the Great going there and [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1898.0s)]
*  tripping balls on the same shit we do. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1901.0s)]
*  That's crazy man. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1903.0s)]
*  One of my favorite quotes is that Cleopatra was born closer to the age of the iPhone than [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1905.0s)]
*  she was to the construction of the pyramids. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1911.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1913.0s)]
*  When you think about it that way you're like wait what what for real. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1914.0s)]
*  That's just the conventional dating of the age of the pyramid which is much discussed [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1920.0s)]
*  and debated. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1926.0s)]
*  Very much. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1927.0s)]
*  And probably should be. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1928.0s)]
*  It really probably should be. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1929.0s)]
*  You know I know people want to point to carbon dating but the problem with that is that we [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1930.0s)]
*  know that people resurface things and they do touch ups. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1935.0s)]
*  In fact they're doing touch ups right now ill advised in my opinion on the base of the [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1940.0s)]
*  Sphinx where they've covered the feet. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1945.0s)]
*  I think that's horrible. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1947.0s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1948.0s)]
*  I should have air dropped this to Jamie. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1949.0s)]
*  I'll send it to him in a second. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1952.0s)]
*  There's a image that I've got of that I was just sent to me that's pretty amazing. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1953.0s)]
*  There's a wall of one of the magazines in one of the pyramids that has a bunch of those [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1960.0s)]
*  vases in it and this wall is like that collapsed and the magazine is the name for a room. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1965.0s)]
*  Anyway they reconstructed this room. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1972.0s)]
*  They reconstructed the wall and it's got a piece of one of those vases in the fucking [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1974.0s)]
*  wall. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1981.0s)]
*  Like right in the rubble that makes up the wall. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1982.0s)]
*  I could not I just I don't even have it saved I'm sorry. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1985.0s)]
*  Let me grab it real fast. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1988.0s)]
*  Sorry I should have done this before. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1990.0s)]
*  You're one of those dudes who use that tiny little phone. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1991.0s)]
*  Look at that little thing. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1993.0s)]
*  I'm an old guy. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1994.0s)]
*  Is that the iPhone mini? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1995.0s)]
*  Is that what it is or is that the SE or something? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1996.0s)]
*  Oh yeah the SE I think something like that. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=1998.0s)]
*  How long is the battery left on that? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2000.0s)]
*  20 minutes? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2001.0s)]
*  14. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2002.0s)]
*  20 minutes is about 30 extra. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2003.0s)]
*  My son actually he wanted an iPhone so bad I got him an iPhone had it for two years and [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2007.0s)]
*  he's like can I please have an Android I'm so tired of having to charge my phone twice [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2012.0s)]
*  a day at school. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2016.0s)]
*  Well the new iPhones last forever. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2017.0s)]
*  The new iPhones. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2019.0s)]
*  Well I think the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the X24 Ultra have the longest battery [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2020.0s)]
*  life in comparison to the iPhone. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2026.0s)]
*  You know they do those tests where they play like the Avengers and they'll play it like [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2028.0s)]
*  non-stop on a loop to see which battery dies out quicker. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2032.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2036.0s)]
*  The Androids last longer. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2037.0s)]
*  Well that makes sense. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2038.0s)]
*  But not by much. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2039.0s)]
*  Like you have to be a total psycho. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2040.0s)]
*  I have an Android I have a Galaxy S24 Ultra and I have an iPhone. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2042.0s)]
*  I've never had one of them run out of batteries. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2048.0s)]
*  If you charge it in the morning you have to be a total psycho to have it have no battery [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2050.0s)]
*  life at the end of the day. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2054.0s)]
*  You should go to a doctor. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2055.0s)]
*  You have a real phone addiction. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2057.0s)]
*  The only time I ever had that problem recently was when I went to the Met. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2059.0s)]
*  I went to the Met Museum in New York and that was I burnt. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2064.0s)]
*  I had never I was blown away by the artifacts and stuff and ended up like basically burning [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2068.0s)]
*  my phone into the ground. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2074.0s)]
*  Just taking pictures? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2075.0s)]
*  Yeah you got a dead battery son. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2076.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2078.0s)]
*  It's kind of amazing that batteries work at all. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2081.0s)]
*  One of the things I wanted to bring up to you was the Baghdad battery. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2084.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2087.0s)]
*  Do you think that's real? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2088.0s)]
*  Is that was that what that was or is there some debate? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2089.0s)]
*  Let's let's tell people what it what it is. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2092.0s)]
*  It's a clay pot. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2095.0s)]
*  There's a number of them. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2097.0s)]
*  They're clay vessels. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2098.0s)]
*  They have a copper and lead inside of them. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2099.0s)]
*  And the way that the cap is and stuff you could potentially fill them with orange juice [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2103.0s)]
*  or something like that a minor acid and get an electric charge from it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2108.0s)]
*  Now it wouldn't be much of one but you could do it. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2111.0s)]
*  And that's someone's worth noting right there is that you can. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2113.0s)]
*  This has been archaeologists have determined that well yeah I mean we don't like to admit [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2117.0s)]
*  it but yes these potentially could have been batteries. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2122.0s)]
*  So like there was a guy that do a debunking on it that's an arch a popular YouTuber and [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2124.0s)]
*  another archaeologist came around and then kind of slapped him around a little bit. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2130.0s)]
*  He had to admit he's like OK I didn't do my research good. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2133.0s)]
*  So this is the Baghdad battery. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2136.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2137.0s)]
*  What is the conventional explanation for what these things are. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2138.0s)]
*  The conventional explanation is that their pots they really don't have like a good solid [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2142.0s)]
*  debunking of it like despite what it says there on the screen. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2149.0s)]
*  But because of what I mean this is not speculative right because of what the actual materials [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2155.0s)]
*  are. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2160.0s)]
*  If you filled it with a minor acid it would conduct electricity. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2161.0s)]
*  So it does work. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2165.0s)]
*  Yeah it wouldn't make a lot but it would make a little. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2166.0s)]
*  Like how much is a little like enough to power a toothbrush. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2170.0s)]
*  I don't think that much but I know that the reports anyway was that a guy was able to [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2173.0s)]
*  make a very minor electroplating with it and that would be the kind of thing that would [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2178.0s)]
*  be most likely applications because other stuff requires serious. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2184.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2187.0s)]
*  So like plating things with gold and stuff like that. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2188.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2190.0s)]
*  So the real the craziest theory of all for sure is the Christopher Dunn. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2193.0s)]
*  The Christopher Dunn theory about the actual pyramid itself. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2199.0s)]
*  He believes it's a massive power plant and he believed that they were using some sort [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2202.0s)]
*  of chemicals and a certain frequency like vibration to generate hydrogen with all the [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2207.0s)]
*  chambers and all. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2212.0s)]
*  And you know the way he describes it it sounds very compelling because there's I don't know [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2214.0s)]
*  what he's talking about. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2219.0s)]
*  He might he might be making it all up right. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2220.0s)]
*  So the way he's saying it sounds so interesting. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2221.0s)]
*  I've never heard anybody try to break down whether or not what he's saying makes sense [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2223.0s)]
*  though. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2228.0s)]
*  Well I like Chris. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2229.0s)]
*  I get along with him well I do I talk to him on the phone probably a couple of times a [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2230.0s)]
*  month. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2233.0s)]
*  He's we and he knows that I disagree with him. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2235.0s)]
*  The thing that right off the bat as an electrician the first thing that stands out to me is the [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2239.0s)]
*  claim of getting piezoelectricity from the blocks which piezoelectricity is the electricity [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2244.0s)]
*  you get from like a quartz crystal when you stress it. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2250.0s)]
*  So like your watch or a charcoal igniter for a grill right. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2252.0s)]
*  You just there's the igniter is just a piece of quartz that they pop it with a little spring [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2256.0s)]
*  and a stick when you pop it. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2260.0s)]
*  And it's got a piece of metal on each side and wires and that harnesses the charge. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2262.0s)]
*  That's the first thing is each one of the quartz crystals in those big limestone blocks [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2267.0s)]
*  would have to have a piece of metal around it and wires coming off of it or some some way of [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2272.0s)]
*  harnessing the electricity. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2278.0s)]
*  There's tons of natural electricity happens all the time right. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2279.0s)]
*  But you have to harness it in order to do something with it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2282.0s)]
*  Is this just our understanding of how to use electricity and could there potentially be [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2285.0s)]
*  something that we missed. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2289.0s)]
*  Well there's there's definitely stuff we don't know about electricity. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2290.0s)]
*  We'll start there. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2294.0s)]
*  There's clearly things we don't know about. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2295.0s)]
*  We still have guys working on the shit all the time and they're making better and better [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2297.0s)]
*  semiconductors and whatnot all the time. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2300.0s)]
*  But having said that maybe but at that point it's we're kind of like my thinking on that is is if [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2302.0s)]
*  we're going to say this is a technological thing and here's the way we get there and then it's [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2309.0s)]
*  like well but we can't really do this. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2316.0s)]
*  Well can it be something else. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2319.0s)]
*  Well at that point why say that this is why build a technological story from what we have. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2320.0s)]
*  Why not just make shit up. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2325.0s)]
*  Also it's like what came first the chicken or the egg because if you have the technology to turn [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2327.0s)]
*  that thing into a gigantic electrical generator where did you get the technology to build it. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2332.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2339.0s)]
*  Like what do you use if this is the first one if you figure so that means you made more of these to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2340.0s)]
*  make electricity to fit or some other form of power. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2344.0s)]
*  You did something and that's what to me is so amazing about this that no one can really look at [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2348.0s)]
*  and go oh this is simple. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2355.0s)]
*  No no even even if you just it's a tomb it's a tomb alone. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2357.0s)]
*  Even those guys have to admit that it's not simple. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2363.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2366.0s)]
*  But when you look at it from a potentially technological angle I mean there's Chris I put a lot [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2367.0s)]
*  of work into his theory. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2372.0s)]
*  It's not it is intricate and he's a very intelligent person. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2373.0s)]
*  Yeah he is really he's so smart that when I talk to him I feel like I feel like I'm talking to a [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2377.0s)]
*  guy a bit smarter than me. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2384.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2385.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2386.0s)]
*  He's intelligent but I don't agree with him on some of these things and that's really I think that's [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2387.0s)]
*  one of the reasons he likes me is because I'll be chill about it just be like yeah you're fucking [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2391.0s)]
*  charlatan. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2395.0s)]
*  Yeah that's a really important point and that's one of the things that I really do enjoy about your [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2396.0s)]
*  videos when you disagree about something you're very cordial about it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2399.0s)]
*  I think that's important because you know I've talked about this many times but it's a real flaw [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2403.0s)]
*  with human beings. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2408.0s)]
*  We attach ourselves to ideas and we defend those ideas as if we're defending our worth as people [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2409.0s)]
*  and it's stupid and if you're wrong about something it's just information. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2415.0s)]
*  It should just be an idea. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2419.0s)]
*  It shows far more about your flaws if you're willing to defend ideas that are clearly inaccurate. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2421.0s)]
*  I couldn't agree with you more there. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2428.0s)]
*  Thanks for the compliment by the way. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2430.0s)]
*  But yeah I couldn't agree with you more there. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2431.0s)]
*  It's a complete mess and especially when it's science. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2433.0s)]
*  That's where archaeology really can piss me off because these guys there's a lot of it that's just [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2437.0s)]
*  made up stuff right. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2443.0s)]
*  It's one thing to say we know for a fact this was carbon dated to X and blah. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2445.0s)]
*  It's another thing to say this looks like that therefore it's this. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2451.0s)]
*  I mean that's the same. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2454.0s)]
*  The guys say that about all kinds of shit right. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2455.0s)]
*  Oh here's these stones look like pillows ergo they must be concrete. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2457.0s)]
*  Well it's like Jamie could you show that stupid image with the anime face on it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2460.0s)]
*  I'm using this one to drive that point home that the pareidolia is not just because it looks like something does not fucking mean that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2465.0s)]
*  The pareidolia. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2472.0s)]
*  Yeah it's pareidolia is when you see these see something in the clouds or whatever. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2473.0s)]
*  Oh okay. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2477.0s)]
*  Just because something looks like something doesn't mean that this is the way to suss what a fucking ancient artifact is. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2478.0s)]
*  Oh this one is the image of the eyes of is the eyes of Horus is that what that is. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2483.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2487.0s)]
*  And then so there's a lot of weird speculation as to what that means right. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2488.0s)]
*  And some people think it means the pineal gland. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2492.0s)]
*  Yeah there's a lot of speculation about that agreed. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2494.0s)]
*  But we my point is obviously we can't just assume that oh well because it looks like some anime girl it's the ancient Egyptian of course. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2497.0s)]
*  But that's one of the best ones is that the image of someone holding up something that either is a basket or looks like some sort of frequencies are emanating from some device. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2505.0s)]
*  Yeah that was interesting. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2516.0s)]
*  Yeah like maybe it's a basket. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2517.0s)]
*  It doesn't look like a basket though. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2519.0s)]
*  It looks looks like some you're trying to indicate something. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2521.0s)]
*  Yeah it does. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2524.0s)]
*  It does look like they're trying to at the very least. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2525.0s)]
*  The other ones with the is long phallus looking tubes that's that seem to be some sort of energy source or something. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2527.0s)]
*  Well a lot of and a lot of them have that like pyramid shape on their on their crotch right. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2535.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2539.0s)]
*  Just like this big straight and it's not it doesn't look phallic but I mean it kind of implies it but it implies almost like it's just like it's symbolism for something right. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2540.0s)]
*  Those long tube ones see if you could find those. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2549.0s)]
*  How would you describe that like if he's going to search for it. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2551.0s)]
*  Energy emanating from it. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2556.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2558.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2559.0s)]
*  That's yes. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2560.0s)]
*  This is one of the hardest things about this is trying to find them. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2561.0s)]
*  He found it. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2563.0s)]
*  Oh damn. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2564.0s)]
*  Oh then there are lights. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2565.0s)]
*  That's yes. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2566.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2567.0s)]
*  So like what the hell is that. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2568.0s)]
*  That's yeah. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2569.0s)]
*  There is a some people think it's that then that's an actual light bulb. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2570.0s)]
*  That's a bong to the left. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2574.0s)]
*  Some people think that that's a light bulb. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2576.0s)]
*  Well like what is that supposed to be. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2579.0s)]
*  What the hell is that supposed to be. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2581.0s)]
*  There's it looks like a serpent inside of it. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2582.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2584.0s)]
*  It's there. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2585.0s)]
*  The mainstream thing is that it's like a symbol of life and like that's the I forget which which plant that is. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2586.0s)]
*  But it's that thing above. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2594.0s)]
*  What are those little that. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2595.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2597.0s)]
*  What the hell is that. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2598.0s)]
*  Well it looks like writing of some sort but I'm not sure what it says. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2599.0s)]
*  That's one of the my main hopes for A.I. that A.I. will get so sophisticated that can start deciphering these things in a more meaningful way in a way where you could use these large language models like if we get like some you know like they have the Rosetta Stone and the Rosetta Stone allowed them to decipher a lot of the ancient hieroglyphs. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2603.0s)]
*  If they could get some sort of much more comprehensive analysis of what they were trying to say with this stuff. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2625.0s)]
*  That would be nice. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2632.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2633.0s)]
*  If it's even possible. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2634.0s)]
*  I mean I'm just guessing. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2635.0s)]
*  Well it's Dendera light. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2636.0s)]
*  It might be something that they can pull off. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2638.0s)]
*  It's you know A.I. is a tough one. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2641.0s)]
*  You don't have to ask Elon. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2643.0s)]
*  That's more his neck of the woods than mine. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2644.0s)]
*  But so it's a part of the reference is part of the Egyptian creation myth. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2646.0s)]
*  Yes the water lily or the lotus flower was it that came out. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2650.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2656.0s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2657.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2659.0s)]
*  Their iconography is weird. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2660.0s)]
*  That's one of the reasons I was taking so many pictures at the at the Met. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2662.0s)]
*  It was just like just it's so many things just weird just fucking weird. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2665.0s)]
*  You just look at you like this does not. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2671.0s)]
*  It's so old. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2673.0s)]
*  So old and so weird. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2674.0s)]
*  It's like we don't even know what their language sounded like which is also amazing. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2676.0s)]
*  That is like I just have all the places in the world where I could go back in time and observe you know just somehow undetected. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2680.0s)]
*  You know if you get a like a some sort of a sphere of time that could place you in a place where you would you wouldn't disturb anything but you could observe. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2690.0s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2702.0s)]
*  What was going on. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2703.0s)]
*  Well how they do that. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2705.0s)]
*  What did it look like. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2706.0s)]
*  What did their culture look like. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2707.0s)]
*  What did the people look like when they were going about their daily tasks. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2708.0s)]
*  You know we used to think it was slaves that built the pyramid. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2712.0s)]
*  Now they think no they were skilled workers and they think that based on what their diet was and they were eating good food and these these people were well taken care of that were involved in working around that area. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2714.0s)]
*  So who are they. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2727.0s)]
*  What was it. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2728.0s)]
*  What was it all about. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2729.0s)]
*  Yeah that's one of the things that they when they say that it's not slaves that built it that kind of makes me chuckle because yeah we know that they had you know well fed people that worked there. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2731.0s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily mean that they were the only people that worked there. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2742.0s)]
*  I mean if you go right you know what a construction over here you're going to have a guy that's eaten at zip or eating that freaking Burger King or whatever and you're going to have another guy who's eating a three hundred dollar lunch and they're going to be working the same job site. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2745.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2756.0s)]
*  But but also probably a lot of them didn't want to work there and they were forced into it which makes you a slave. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2757.0s)]
*  If you pay slaves well they're still slaves. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2764.0s)]
*  You kill them when they leave. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2766.0s)]
*  They're slaves. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2767.0s)]
*  It's like you have a job to do no matter what you want to do. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2769.0s)]
*  Oh you want to become a musician. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2772.0s)]
*  Fuck off. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2773.0s)]
*  Go push that rock. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2774.0s)]
*  Push the rock and push it some more. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2775.0s)]
*  You know what that one is another. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2776.0s)]
*  We're never going to stop being fascinated by the people of the past that we don't understand. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2779.0s)]
*  And I think again the best example that is Egypt. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2785.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2788.0s)]
*  That's where like we were talking about how the archaeology and the archaeologists and pseudo guys will argue with each other so much about and it gets so bad blooded about it. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2789.0s)]
*  It's like I talked about this a little bit last time but there's really is I see this two distinct like halves of the human psyche at work in this thing in this regard. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2799.0s)]
*  You can almost see the distinction in the way that scientists tend to be anti-social. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2808.0s)]
*  They're they're not anti-social might not be the right word but they're just a little fucking weird man. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2813.0s)]
*  They're the kind of guys that they dress weird they talk weird they act weird they just come across fucking weird talking about fun. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2819.0s)]
*  I'm talking about all scientists in general. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2825.0s)]
*  But yes he would be one of them but he's not the only one like John Hoopes is a great example of this too. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2828.0s)]
*  If you watch him the way he carries himself the way he talks he's just fucking weird. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2833.0s)]
*  And look at Einstein. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2837.0s)]
*  You watch that guy he carried himself fucking weird. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2838.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2841.0s)]
*  But my friend Chris Williamson has a very interesting take on that that I think is very accurate. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2842.0s)]
*  He said if you expect regular people to get extraordinary results you're being silly. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2846.0s)]
*  You're going to get weird people that get weird results. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2853.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2856.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2857.0s)]
*  Now I'm more scientifically literate I think than most of the people that I know. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2858.0s)]
*  So and I kind of feel like like Shane Gillis jokes about being nicked by the Down syndrome thing. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2864.0s)]
*  I feel like I was nicked by that anti-social thing. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2870.0s)]
*  I walk into a bar and if I don't know anybody my first instinct is just to go sit in the corner and watch. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2872.0s)]
*  That's part of the problem with being intelligent. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2877.0s)]
*  You're worried that you're going to get dragged into a dumbass conversation. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2880.0s)]
*  But it's stimulating. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2884.0s)]
*  It's the opposite of stimulating. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2886.0s)]
*  Oh it's terrible. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2887.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2888.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2889.0s)]
*  But if you sit in the corner and watch well then you look like the weird old guy creeper in from the fucking corner. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2890.0s)]
*  So you just go sit at the bar and talk to people. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2894.0s)]
*  But I'm aware that you know I can be a little off that way. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2896.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2900.0s)]
*  But these guys there every now and again one of them will show up. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2901.0s)]
*  It's like Carl Sagan. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2904.0s)]
*  This guy he's just a regular Joe. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2906.0s)]
*  He could talk to everybody and he happens to be a fucking great scientist. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2908.0s)]
*  And you know he got a lot of shit from his colleagues for that. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2911.0s)]
*  He got a lot of shit from his colleagues for taking the time to talk to the peasants. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2916.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2919.0s)]
*  But and the way he did it wasn't abrasive. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2920.0s)]
*  You know if somebody asked him about aliens if they're like man you know what what do you think was the aliens were up to over on Alpha Centauri. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2923.0s)]
*  What kind of technology do you think they have. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2930.0s)]
*  That's almost his initial response to be like you know he's thinking how the fuck am I supposed to do. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2932.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2936.0s)]
*  But then he well you know Alpha Centauri is about a billion years older than our star. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2937.0s)]
*  So if you were to assume that they were around for a billion years longer than us and had the same stuff. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2941.0s)]
*  And so he would entertain them and then he would do things he would interject a little bit of science when they would ask a question. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2946.0s)]
*  He would answer it and make sure that there was a little science in that so that people that really didn't give a fuck about learning about the science. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2953.0s)]
*  They just want to talk about UFOs. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2961.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2962.0s)]
*  Spoonful of sugar and the fucking medicine went down. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2963.0s)]
*  You're walking out with some science in your head like it or not. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2965.0s)]
*  Yeah that's being a science educator right which is very important and very rare. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2968.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2973.0s)]
*  To be good. It's very rare for them to be good. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2974.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2976.0s)]
*  The have you seen the recent images that they got from Mars or that big square. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2977.0s)]
*  What the fuck is that. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2982.0s)]
*  I. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2985.0s)]
*  That's one of those things where I was talking to Jamie just before the show. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2986.0s)]
*  It's is a bad day to be a professional skeptic. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2989.0s)]
*  I'm telling you what. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2992.0s)]
*  If this you've been making the last year living the last 20 years poo poo and all the aliens and UFO shit and whatnot man oh man is it a rough day for you because that same shit was LIDAR from the South American forest you'd be like yeah it's probably a village there. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=2993.0s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3005.0s)]
*  This is even more clear than live. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3006.0s)]
*  Yeah I know it's super. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3007.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3009.0s)]
*  Jamie pulled a photo of it up. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3010.0s)]
*  This is super recent right. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3012.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3013.0s)]
*  Just a few days ago. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3014.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3015.0s)]
*  This this found it recently I think it's been online for a while. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3016.0s)]
*  Oh really. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3018.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3019.0s)]
*  Oh so there's is it that there's a mass of data that they scan from the surface and then someone just detected this recently. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3020.0s)]
*  I think someone just found it on the website. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3027.0s)]
*  It might be one of those things it's like who is going to go by hand over each one of these images and I mean you're dealing with the entire surface of a planet that's what is it like three quarters of the size of Earth. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3029.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3041.0s)]
*  That might think that might even be a little small that that's smaller than that. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3042.0s)]
*  I think it's a little larger but I could be wrong. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3047.0s)]
*  Well so something smaller than Earth. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3050.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3052.0s)]
*  But bigger than the moon and you're going to go over the entire surface of it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3053.0s)]
*  A lot. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3056.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3057.0s)]
*  And this I think they think the rough estimates of this square are between 300 kilometers 300 meters and multiple kilometers. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3058.0s)]
*  They don't know how big it is. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3067.0s)]
*  You know it's because it's like it's hard to get a reference. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3069.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3071.0s)]
*  So I think the estimate is at the very smallest it's several hundred meters across. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3072.0s)]
*  So this thing this square it's really crazy because it's right angle right angle right angle right angle. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3076.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3084.0s)]
*  And doesn't look to be very asymmetrical. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3085.0s)]
*  This one says like they added that square. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3089.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3091.0s)]
*  See it better. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3092.0s)]
*  It's like superimposed on that one. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3093.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3094.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3095.0s)]
*  But this is the original image. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3096.0s)]
*  Just this alone. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3097.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3098.0s)]
*  You're like what the fuck. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3099.0s)]
*  If that was a LIDAR picture from South America I'd be like OK. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3100.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3103.0s)]
*  It's just too convenient that it makes a square. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3104.0s)]
*  It just seems so weird. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3108.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3110.0s)]
*  It's and then there's another image that goes along with this. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3111.0s)]
*  That's even more bizarre. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3113.0s)]
*  Maybe not even more bizarre but it's like almost looks like a cone like a cone structure that's emanating from the surface like surrounded by a circle. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3125.0s)]
*  Have you seen that one. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3126.0s)]
*  I've seen people talk about that one. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3127.0s)]
*  Jamie. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3128.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3129.0s)]
*  It's it's real weird stuff and no one has like the face on Mars was real interesting. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3130.0s)]
*  I got really into Richard Hoagland and all his side don't he has stuff for a while but he was making some very bizarre measurements like if you go one half of the distance between this and three quarters of the way between that's exact number that takes. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3138.0s)]
*  Like what do you but don't do that. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3151.0s)]
*  How about don't do that. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3153.0s)]
*  Don't just fucking arbitrarily look for some sort of. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3155.0s)]
*  I did that in a video once kind of being a dick making fun of the idea that there's all this data encoded in the bases. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3159.0s)]
*  I have no problem with the idea of the bases being like proof that these guys were definitely fucking exacting and whatnot. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3165.0s)]
*  But the idea that they've like hidden data is that the side don't you face. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3172.0s)]
*  I guess it's right by the square. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3178.0s)]
*  What. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3180.0s)]
*  Really. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3181.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3182.0s)]
*  I guess right. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3183.0s)]
*  Is that what that's saying. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3184.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3186.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3187.0s)]
*  It says the giant square structure just a short hike from the legendary face on Mars. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3188.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3191.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3192.0s)]
*  How do they miss that. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3193.0s)]
*  They were concentrated on the face which is like it might be a face might not be to me the original images. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3201.0s)]
*  Look really wild. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3202.0s)]
*  But then the images afterwards were like oh no it's just the weird light hitting it in a certain way. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3203.0s)]
*  Find plenty of structures on Earth that would do a similar thing. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3209.0s)]
*  But I saw this too. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3213.0s)]
*  Why is that. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3215.0s)]
*  This weird shit they're finding sticking out. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3221.0s)]
*  You find weird shit in nature. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3222.0s)]
*  That that's not as compelling as the other one. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3224.0s)]
*  There was something that looked like a cone. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3226.0s)]
*  So the actual image when they got what is that dirty stuff. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3228.0s)]
*  You got horrible feed that you. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3232.0s)]
*  I just typed in Mars photo. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3235.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3236.0s)]
*  Time for a bathroom break. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3237.0s)]
*  Twitter. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3238.0s)]
*  What's wrong with Twitterworks. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3239.0s)]
*  And I just kind of wow the Twitter has like hardcore porn. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3240.0s)]
*  It always has. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3243.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3244.0s)]
*  Very weird. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3245.0s)]
*  I'm not complaining. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3246.0s)]
*  Do whatever you want. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3247.0s)]
*  I'm all for doing whatever you want. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3248.0s)]
*  But this original tract of images it's a long one. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3249.0s)]
*  And if you scroll through it one of them is some very bizarre looking cone like structure. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3254.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3261.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3262.0s)]
*  Oh OK. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3263.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3264.0s)]
*  That is weird. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3265.0s)]
*  Like what's that. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3266.0s)]
*  I mean it could be just a mountain but it looks like a zit. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3267.0s)]
*  It does. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3271.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3272.0s)]
*  And the fact that it's so close to that other thing. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3273.0s)]
*  That's what screw. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3276.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3277.0s)]
*  The faces in it. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3278.0s)]
*  They're all. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3279.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3280.0s)]
*  So it's all this one area that's been studied for a long time as being that there's a bunch [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3281.0s)]
*  of different things there that you can interpret as being some sort of a structure. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3284.68s)]
*  Well Jimmy was sharing that video in response to this. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3289.0s)]
*  Buzz Aldrin saying that there's like a monolith a monolith on the moon. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3294.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3298.24s)]
*  I hadn't seen that before. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3299.24s)]
*  I mean I embarrassingly had always been a little out of the UFO side of things. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3300.24s)]
*  I always watched it but always you know just a little bit. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3304.72s)]
*  I'm usually looking at pyramids. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3308.16s)]
*  Wouldn't you like to feed Buzz Aldrin some mushrooms and say tell me what you know. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3309.16s)]
*  Dude yeah. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3312.68s)]
*  Tell me what you really know. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3313.68s)]
*  I like what you know. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3314.68s)]
*  Did you really go. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3315.68s)]
*  I like the clip when he punches that fucking dude. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3316.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3318.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3319.48s)]
*  Yeah that guy. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3320.48s)]
*  You're a liar. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3321.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3322.96s)]
*  He needs to work on his punch. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3323.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3325.96s)]
*  Had a clean shot and didn't do anything. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3326.96s)]
*  Hey it's a zero gravity training. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3327.96s)]
*  His bones are deteriorating. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3329.96s)]
*  He's been in space for so long. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3331.96s)]
*  That is a wild thing that does happen to them. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3333.8s)]
*  It takes forever for your body to get back to normal. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3335.76s)]
*  Yeah it's crazy. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3338.64s)]
*  It's crazy to think that like that stress is needed. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3339.64s)]
*  Like if you don't have those kinds of stresses in your life that like your body just. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3343.12s)]
*  Yeah which fucks up the whole Superman myth. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3348.16s)]
*  If Superman came over here his body would deteriorate. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3350.44s)]
*  After a while he'd be just like us. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3353.32s)]
*  Poor guy. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3355.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3356.2000000000003s)]
*  Wouldn't work. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3357.2000000000003s)]
*  He can't just fly. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3358.2000000000003s)]
*  But obviously cartoons. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3359.2000000000003s)]
*  No X-ray vision. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3360.68s)]
*  Yeah all those things. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3361.68s)]
*  The ability to go so fast you could spin time backwards. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3363.56s)]
*  Remember. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3366.32s)]
*  Same Louis Lane. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3367.32s)]
*  Water goes up the hill. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3370.8s)]
*  If you could somehow or another make sense out of the possibility that a civilization [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3373.16s)]
*  existed on Mars and was wiped out millions and millions of years ago that would change [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3380.3999999999996s)]
*  the way we think about everything. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3385.96s)]
*  And I feel like that square is one step closer to like really needing a comprehensive analysis [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3388.3199999999997s)]
*  of what's there. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3396.46s)]
*  Because before it was just like oh it's a lifeless planet but at one time it had an [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3398.72s)]
*  atmosphere. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3402.5s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3403.5s)]
*  Oh they found frozen water. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3404.5s)]
*  Oh interesting. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3406.46s)]
*  Well they actually found liquid water now. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3407.46s)]
*  More interesting. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3409.46s)]
*  Now they found a big square. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3410.5s)]
*  OK what's that. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3412.02s)]
*  That one to me is the what's that. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3414.3s)]
*  And this is where in my mind the this is where the that skeptics versus dreamers think it's [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3416.48s)]
*  really fucked because the answer should be the same for everybody. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3423.26s)]
*  Let's just next expedition. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3429.06s)]
*  Let's poke around a little up there right. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3431.2999999999997s)]
*  Let's find out the evidence. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3433.14s)]
*  But the answer is always from one side it's definitely this from the other side it's definitely [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3434.5s)]
*  not not completely but that to the point where we don't get to draw a parallel without John [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3439.3799999999997s)]
*  Aguni the site the underwater site that Graham Hancock likes to talk about. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3445.56s)]
*  The skeptics are certain that it's a geological formation. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3449.9s)]
*  Most of the other people are not. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3453.7s)]
*  We need work done. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3456.46s)]
*  The clear fucking answer is just put some money at it put some bodies on it and until [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3458.06s)]
*  then the answer in my mind is that somebody asks me what do I think about John Aguni. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3462.02s)]
*  I say well it's interesting that you know it's probably been eroded for a long time [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3466.14s)]
*  so it might be manmade and just looks naturally. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3469.76s)]
*  It might be natural. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3472.94s)]
*  We need more evidence before I'm going to hang my hat anywhere. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3474.26s)]
*  And that which is very reasonable. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3477.46s)]
*  And in all honesty it should be the scientific position. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3479.1s)]
*  It should be the position that the scientists are espousing if they wanted to have credibility [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3481.62s)]
*  in the sphere. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3485.42s)]
*  They should be the ones towing that line and then let the pyramidiates all be certain and [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3486.6600000000003s)]
*  this is how we know it was. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3492.26s)]
*  Scientists can look but instead they get in the mud and act just like everybody else. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3493.7400000000002s)]
*  They also stall progress with their arrogance. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3498.98s)]
*  They stall progress by dismissing any possibility. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3502.58s)]
*  Like what are those ones. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3506.1600000000003s)]
*  Is it near the Bahamas those enormous stones that are on the floor the surface of the ocean. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3508.1s)]
*  The Bimini Road. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3513.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3514.9s)]
*  That one's weird. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3515.9s)]
*  If you don't think that's weird like come on. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3516.9s)]
*  And they're right. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3519.98s)]
*  I would agree with a geologist that there's a really good chance that it's just beach [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3521.6600000000003s)]
*  rock. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3524.78s)]
*  However we can do work. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3525.78s)]
*  This is the stuff it's like other people that you know if you say that the rocks are geopolymers [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3529.26s)]
*  and such say huamon or whatever. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3533.78s)]
*  It's like there's no reason for us to argue about this man. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3536.1s)]
*  We just fucking do some work. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3538.78s)]
*  The Bimini Road is really interesting. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3541.3s)]
*  There's a lot of really interesting stuff that they find under the under the water that [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3543.82s)]
*  makes you think OK what is this. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3547.94s)]
*  And the Yonaguni thing like if that's the case. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3550.94s)]
*  See that to me that could easily be natural. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3553.76s)]
*  When I'm looking at it right there that easily could be natural. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3557.34s)]
*  They're not uniform enough to for bells to go off. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3561.0600000000004s)]
*  You know but that one lower right that one right below that Jamie right below your cursor [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3564.6000000000004s)]
*  to the right. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3570.02s)]
*  That one freaks me out a little. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3571.0600000000004s)]
*  That seems like those are stacked. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3573.18s)]
*  Yeah it does. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3574.7s)]
*  It seems very much like that. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3575.7s)]
*  And when you're dealing with if you want to go really crazy with like the John Anthony [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3577.7s)]
*  West version of it which is like 30,000 plus years. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3583.72s)]
*  That's probably what you would have left over. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3587.18s)]
*  That's accurate. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3589.58s)]
*  There that's there's a thought tool that archaeologists use called the Solurian hypothesis and Solurian [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3590.58s)]
*  sounds like as Dr. Who bad guy that was a went into hibernation. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3598.62s)]
*  There were lizards they went into hibernation like before the dinosaurs died out and then [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3603.18s)]
*  they wake up one day and there's all these monkeys running around on their planet and [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3606.8199999999997s)]
*  so but that's the Dr. Who thing right. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3609.98s)]
*  But the Solurian hypothesis is basically a thought tool for archaeologists and historians [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3613.3399999999997s)]
*  to say well if there was a advanced civilization on earth 10 million years ago what will we [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3617.9s)]
*  need to find in order for it to exist. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3623.2999999999997s)]
*  What would we find now 10 million years later. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3626.82s)]
*  And the answer is usually like radioactive material. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3630.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like 10 million years man. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3632.6600000000003s)]
*  You might find a couple of bones but the odds of finding anything that's going to actually [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3634.7000000000003s)]
*  prove that they had technology. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3637.34s)]
*  Not much. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3640.7400000000002s)]
*  That's also the problem with the idea of this very sophisticated construction methods of [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3641.7400000000002s)]
*  the pyramids that were using some sort of advanced technology. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3647.78s)]
*  If John Anthony West is correct and he's talking about 30 plus thousand years what would be [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3652.14s)]
*  left after 30,000 years. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3658.62s)]
*  Well certainly not much metal. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3660.3799999999997s)]
*  No oh no that's that stuff would be looted right away. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3662.2999999999997s)]
*  And even if it wasn't what would be actually left of it if it was just like sitting on [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3665.66s)]
*  the ground. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3669.4199999999996s)]
*  Be rotted and melted. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3670.4199999999996s)]
*  To nothing. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3671.8999999999996s)]
*  The video that you sent me yesterday the one with the stone nubs. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3673.22s)]
*  They talked about holes. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3680.2599999999998s)]
*  All those I can't say for all the sites but like the Colosseum and stuff they used metal [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3682.7799999999997s)]
*  to bond the bricks together and the concrete together in places. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3687.06s)]
*  So years later when the city's under attack and they need metal to make swords they looted [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3691.54s)]
*  it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3696.5s)]
*  That's recorded. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3697.5s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3698.5s)]
*  And it happened a lot in the Roman world. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3699.5s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up the nubs. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3701.3799999999997s)]
*  Because the nubs that was one of the videos that I watched of yours yesterday. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3703.4599999999996s)]
*  Where we're talking about folks is there's many places like Machu Picchu. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3708.7s)]
*  What other places have nubs? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3714.82s)]
*  All over the place. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3716.06s)]
*  Even that Montana thing. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3717.06s)]
*  Which is weird. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3718.06s)]
*  You'll see them on Egyptian sarcophagi. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3719.06s)]
*  You'll see them on the unfinished casing stones at the bottom of Menkari's pyramid. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3722.78s)]
*  You'll see them basically almost every megalithic site on the planet has some nubs somewhere. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3728.1s)]
*  All the ones if they're finished blocks you'll usually find nubs somewhere. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3733.46s)]
*  Do you think that it's possible that those nubs were used to hoist things up and move [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3736.2599999999998s)]
*  them into place? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3741.98s)]
*  Oh yeah absolutely. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3742.98s)]
*  I mean there's a technique called a lifting boss that's used to lift big things like that. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3743.98s)]
*  But there's a couple of issues with that being the only reason that they're used. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3751.8599999999997s)]
*  For one a lot of times they're small like that and they wouldn't really do you much [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3757.58s)]
*  good. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3760.22s)]
*  A lot of times we see them on the lids of a coffin for example. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3761.4199999999996s)]
*  Which you wouldn't want to leave it there afterwards because you don't want to facilitate [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3766.1s)]
*  the next guy to be able to pop the coffin lid. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3769.66s)]
*  You say that they're small but if you were trying to place something exactly and you [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3772.1s)]
*  were lifting it up from the bottom the only way you would be able to do that is if you [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3776.66s)]
*  had something like a nub sticking on the outside of it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3780.9399999999996s)]
*  In order to catch a rope or keep it from walking. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3783.22s)]
*  Or whatever it is, boards or whatever you're using to lift that and place it into position. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3786.34s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3792.34s)]
*  Like I say, lifting bosses are a thing. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3794.2200000000003s)]
*  It's not unknown. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3800.82s)]
*  There's a good possibility, I mean there's not a good possibility, quite certainly, quite [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3803.9s)]
*  frequently these were used for that. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3807.5400000000004s)]
*  Interesting also that the bottom stones don't have them. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3809.98s)]
*  The fact, a lot of people do bring up a good point, I didn't talk about it in my video, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3814.42s)]
*  but it's interesting point is that why did they get left. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3818.38s)]
*  Now like that one around the windows there, to me that's pretty clearly, to the left Jimmy, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3821.5s)]
*  sorry that one right there, that one's pretty clearly to me, that's functional. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3827.3s)]
*  Right, that looks like maybe it had an iron gate attached to it or something. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3833.06s)]
*  Or some shit, a smoking balcony. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3838.74s)]
*  Some of them on the other hand, they look a lot more questionable. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3843.42s)]
*  Those are odd. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3847.94s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3850.78s)]
*  They're just fucking weird. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3851.78s)]
*  Sometimes you see them on things that don't, like the stone was carved in the ground and [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3855.86s)]
*  they left these on. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3860.7s)]
*  Sorry, Jamie, to the one a little bit higher with the red tint to it, upper right hand [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3861.7s)]
*  side, upper right, right above that. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3865.22s)]
*  Yeah, click on that. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3866.9s)]
*  That is so strange. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3868.3s)]
*  See now like on stones like these, you don't really need a lifting boss. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3871.34s)]
*  Okay, you got like that, look at that stone that's on the right there, that's all the [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3875.42s)]
*  one to the left, that guy there. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3878.98s)]
*  You could just use that lip on the corner right below the cursor, you could use that [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3881.82s)]
*  lip for a lifting boss. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3886.7000000000003s)]
*  You could tie a rope around that thing and push it wherever the fuck you want it. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3887.7000000000003s)]
*  Right, but if you wanted to get it to sit down without having to pull out whatever's [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3891.1800000000003s)]
*  underneath it or whatever underneath it getting crushed, wouldn't you want something to assist [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3896.6200000000003s)]
*  you like that little nub? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3900.6600000000003s)]
*  No, yeah, but again you could just pop it into the corner on the side and do the same [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3902.0600000000004s)]
*  thing. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3906.7400000000002s)]
*  But if you were doing that as a method for each individual stone, and some of them you [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3907.7400000000002s)]
*  couldn't pop in like that. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3910.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3912.1800000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3913.1800000000003s)]
*  Like it would be a technique that you would use to hoist these things into position. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3914.1800000000003s)]
*  Does anybody have an explanation of what these things are? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3918.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, the lifting boss is what the mainstream explanation is. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3922.02s)]
*  All of them were for that. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3925.8599999999997s)]
*  And there's, again, it's the ubiquity that really makes it different to me. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3927.2999999999997s)]
*  And popping up on different sides of the ocean, that's where it just seems kind of weird. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3932.98s)]
*  For it to show up looking so similar, used so similar all over the place, left behind [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3940.42s)]
*  when they're done, that's kind of weird too. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3945.6s)]
*  Right, they didn't polish them down. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3947.58s)]
*  They didn't polish them down, yeah. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3948.8599999999997s)]
*  The rest of the walls, a lot of times, I mean, the stones are fitted so well together, clearly [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3950.94s)]
*  they knew how to make these stones flat as fuck. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3954.42s)]
*  Why is this part still got this big tit hanging off of it? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3956.62s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3960.2599999999998s)]
*  Despite the title of my video saying the true purpose, that's just clickbait, nobody knows. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3963.2599999999998s)]
*  There's the best mainstream explanation would be lifting bosses. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3968.38s)]
*  The most common alternate history explanation is usually like, it's like a leftover from [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3972.62s)]
*  just concrete being pulled out like the guy in the video was saying, or it's like if [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3979.46s)]
*  you have a bag of concrete and it's just like the one little spot that kind of seeps out. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3984.18s)]
*  I don't think that they're from geopolymers, but that's- [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3989.5s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard the concrete explanation too, as far as the stones and the Great Pyramid, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3992.7400000000002s)]
*  but- [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3997.86s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3998.86s)]
*  We can test, again, we can test these things. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=3999.86s)]
*  That's where some of the guys that claim that they're all everything's geopolymers will [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4002.26s)]
*  pretend that we can't test things, but the reality is we absolutely can test that for [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4007.54s)]
*  that kind of shit. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4011.1s)]
*  I mean, it's not difficult at all, actually. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4012.1s)]
*  The problem is, and this is where it gets, like you said, the archaeologists stand between [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4015.94s)]
*  things. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4020.42s)]
*  The problem is that in certain places in the world, like Peru, for example, and Bolivia, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4021.42s)]
*  it's fucking hard to get ... Look at those alien bodies right now in Peru, right? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4025.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4031.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, we've been looking at them. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4032.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure you have. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4033.7400000000002s)]
*  I keep saying they're real, but the only fucking scientist I ever see weighing in on them are [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4034.8199999999997s)]
*  Peruvian scientists. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4038.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like, well, okay, let some people from around the world ... Oh, no, no, no, fuck you [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4039.8199999999997s)]
*  guys. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4043.02s)]
*  These are us. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4044.02s)]
*  All right, man. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4045.02s)]
*  That's ... [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4046.02s)]
*  But is that like a hyper-exaggerated version of the Boneyard? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4047.02s)]
*  It could be. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4050.5s)]
*  With deeper implications? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4051.5s)]
*  It could be, but we've seen a lot of the same kind of stuff with them with ... They have [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4052.5s)]
*  a problem in Peru with archaeology and corruption with the money. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4059.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you saw my video on the elongated skulls, but- [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4063.5s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4066.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4067.8199999999997s)]
*  That video, I just covered basically how those things came in these big bundles. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4068.8199999999997s)]
*  They'd get these grave bags, and there'd be a body in there. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4072.7s)]
*  They harvested a couple of, at least like 600 of these bundles. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4076.8999999999996s)]
*  Every time they just get opened, and willy-nilly shit get moved around. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4082.4199999999996s)]
*  Rockefeller ends up trading for a few of them and to finance, because they didn't have finances [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4087.3799999999997s)]
*  to store these things properly. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4092.02s)]
*  So Rockefeller got some of those heads? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4093.5400000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4096.06s)]
*  He brought ... And we don't know how many exactly. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4097.06s)]
*  He ... Reportedly just four. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4099.900000000001s)]
*  He gives the money to these people to restore all these mummies, and the first thing that [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4102.9800000000005s)]
*  they do is they restore a bunch of textiles that other mummies that they don't have anymore [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4106.74s)]
*  were packed in and shit. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4110.54s)]
*  Even all the way up into the 60s, an anthropologist opened 70 some odd bundles, recorded what [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4114.06s)]
*  he found in four of them and put the rest back on the fucking shelf. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4120.66s)]
*  They've been stealing artifacts and selling them on the open market. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4124.34s)]
*  It's all about money. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4127.54s)]
*  So really rich people, like some billionaire guy goes, I want a mummy. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4128.54s)]
*  What do I got to get to? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4133.38s)]
*  I want a mummy room in my castle. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4134.38s)]
*  I want one with a head. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4135.86s)]
*  I want one with a really weird head. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4136.86s)]
*  Which one's got the best head? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4138.66s)]
*  Let's open 60. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4139.94s)]
*  And that's just the Kuzco tunnels. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4142.74s)]
*  They just ... This one's so fucked. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4145.58s)]
*  They just announced this January, archaeologists have discovered that there are tunnels running [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4148.78s)]
*  under Kuzco in Peru. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4153.98s)]
*  They connect the Temple of the Sun to the Fortress of Sacsayhuaman and some other places [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4155.0199999999995s)]
*  around there. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4159.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, this is crazy. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4160.0599999999995s)]
*  It's going to be great, man. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4161.0599999999995s)]
*  We did all this light art. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4162.0599999999995s)]
*  It's going to be amazing, amazing discovery. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4163.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, Brian Forrester uploaded a video like 11 years ago of him going on a tour of those [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4165.139999999999s)]
*  tunnels. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4169.54s)]
*  You could pay a guide 20 years ago to go on a tour of those tunnels. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4170.54s)]
*  They fucking were ... The Spanish were writing about them in the 1600s and the late 1500s. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4173.38s)]
*  The only reason that we didn't investigate these tunnels is because in the 30s was when [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4178.54s)]
*  archaeology started becoming a thing and going down there and checking out those skulls and [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4183.3s)]
*  shit. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4186.74s)]
*  And at the exact same time, Madame Blavatsky and Edgar Cayce was like, you know, those [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4187.74s)]
*  tunnels that are supposed to be down there, I bet they were built by the Atlanteans. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4191.66s)]
*  And so ever since then, archaeologists have poo-pooed it. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4195.34s)]
*  There was a guy in the 2000s that ... He's an Atlantis hunter. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4197.7s)]
*  He did ground penetrating radar in early 2000s, found those tunnels. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4201.02s)]
*  They rejected his work. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4204.42s)]
*  He had a priest that witnessed those tunnels, has been down in them. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4205.42s)]
*  He was rejected out of hand. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4209.14s)]
*  But that's okay because 25 years later we found it. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4211.02s)]
*  I promise they didn't steal or sell anything in the last 100 years. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4214.9800000000005s)]
*  That the world knew that these things existed. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4218.7s)]
*  Rich people were going down there and throwing money around and there was zero safeguards. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4220.9s)]
*  It's just ... So to circle back to the UFOs, the aliens there, it's like, I have a real [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4225.1s)]
*  problem with that shit in Peru because I can't ... It's just so tainted. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4230.06s)]
*  It's so corrupt. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4233.9800000000005s)]
*  It's so weird too. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4235.0199999999995s)]
*  I love looking at it. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4236.82s)]
*  I wish it was real. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4238.0199999999995s)]
*  But that to me is always the problem whenever it comes to alien stuff. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4239.379999999999s)]
*  I want it to be real. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4242.82s)]
*  So that part of my brain, I have to go, hey, stupid. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4244.5s)]
*  Just because this is an X-ray doesn't mean this is legit. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4248.9s)]
*  By the way, I can make you a fake X-ray pretty easy online these days. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4252.139999999999s)]
*  It wouldn't be hard at all. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4255.219999999999s)]
*  But these X-rays are so compelling that if they are legitimate X-rays, if someone really [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4256.98s)]
*  did just piece this together with a bunch of random bones, what a fantastic job they [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4262.74s)]
*  did because it doesn't look awkward at all. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4268.26s)]
*  It looks real. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4270.46s)]
*  The thing about them that looks the fakest is just a photograph of the bodies themselves. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4272.66s)]
*  Everything else looks fucking pretty legit. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4276.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4278.54s)]
*  If the X-rays are real, and this is part of the problem, but the X-rays that they show, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4279.54s)]

*  You see the three-fingered hands. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4288.66s)]
*  You see the bones look similar to ours, but different. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4290.3s)]
*  There's enough of it that's similar to a human being's, and it is some sort of bipedal, hominid-like [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4294.62s)]
*  creature, whatever it is. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4303.54s)]

*  so it wouldn't be for us to discover a new species even if they weren't aliens. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4312.66s)]
*  Imagine if they were way more advanced than us, but they got wiped out. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4317.9s)]
*  There's versions of us that aren't as good as us, that aren't here anymore. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4325.14s)]
*  We have Homo sapiens, Denisovans that didn't discover until a decade or so ago. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4330.62s)]
*  Then there's a bunch of different versions of human beings that weren't as good as us, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4335.14s)]
*  and we're the ones that ... Maybe ones were better, and maybe the ones that were better [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4339.46s)]

*  You could say, well, why did we ... Some people would think at that point, why did we make [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4350.74s)]

*  What is this, Jamie? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4367.34s)]
*  I'm reading an article about the mummies right now, and this popped up. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4368.34s)]
*  Metallic plates have been found throughout other areas of the mummy's bodies from the [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4371.3s)]

*  implant with no signs of rejection. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4380.1s)]
*  These polymetallic plates have been analyzed using a light-based measurement, revealing [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4383.42s)]
*  an alloy compound of copper, cadmium, osmium, aluminum, gold, and silver, he added. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4389.18s)]
*  Notably, the silver has a purity of over 95%, which is rare in nature. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4395.1s)]
*  Additionally, cadmium and osmium, relatively recent discoveries, are currently used in [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4399.34s)]

*  Right. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4426.1s)]

*  Yeah, the small ones. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4462.78s)]
*  The rest of them are not. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4463.78s)]

*  Imagine. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4480.66s)]
*  Well, we need a bunch of expeditions. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4481.66s)]
*  We need answers. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4483.1s)]
*  We need someone who is at a high position of the White House that's interested in this [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4485.34s)]
*  stuff. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4490.06s)]

*  Find one of them things, bring it to America, and let's do a live stream of scientists actually [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4493.06s)]

*  They did that with a couple of the bundles. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4506.34s)]
*  They tried to with a couple of the bundles in the 50s. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4508.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4511.82s)]
*  It was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4512.82s)]

*  They just disappeared. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4521.82s)]
*  Big fucking shock. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4522.82s)]
*  There's a newspaper article that recorded what she found in one of them. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4524.82s)]
*  That newspaper article is not in their archives. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4528.82s)]

*  It just stinks. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4532.82s)]
*  It's like I, I am not. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4533.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4535.82s)]
*  It's, I'm not a conspiratorial type of person, but I'm not stupid either. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4536.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4539.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4540.82s)]
*  Pretty clear fucking conspiracy there. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4541.82s)]
*  So what was supposedly the synopsis of her article? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4542.82s)]
*  She was just talking about what she found inside of the, one of those mummy bundles [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4546.82s)]
*  with the, the elongated skulls and the artifacts that would be in there, the grave goods and [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4551.82s)]
*  stuff. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4555.82s)]
*  The thing about the elongated skulls is that some of them have a larger capacity, which [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4556.82s)]
*  is interesting. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4559.82s)]
*  So it's not simply like, cause we know that there's a technique that they do with young [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4560.82s)]
*  children where they put boards on the side of their heads and they flatten their head [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4564.82s)]
*  out. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4567.82s)]
*  You can actually form someone's head, but that's not necessarily what was supposed to [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4568.82s)]
*  be done. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4571.82s)]
*  It's not necessarily what was being done here. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4572.82s)]
*  No, it, there's the, the kind of nuanced argument is that some of them were legitimate [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4573.82s)]
*  aliens or other species or whatever. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4580.82s)]
*  And then some of them were people trying to emulate that with their own kids. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4582.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4586.82s)]
*  Like that it was a status symbol to have that elongated head. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4587.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4590.82s)]
*  So people tried to fake it and pretend maybe it was just a genetic anomaly, right? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4591.82s)]
*  Like some sort of bizarre, like we, we talked about this, the people that are born, they [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4595.82s)]
*  there's a certain tribe in Africa where a bunch of them have only two toes and they [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4601.82s)]
*  look like ostrich feet. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4605.82s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4606.82s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4607.82s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4608.82s)]
*  Jamie could find it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4609.82s)]
*  It's a real weird. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4610.82s)]
*  So it's a, some genetic anomaly that like a lot of people have there. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4611.82s)]
*  It's not really, it's not rare. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4616.82s)]
*  There's a photo of a bunch of them sitting there with their feet up. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4618.82s)]
*  That's what their toes look like. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4621.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4623.82s)]
*  And so there's quite a few people that have this genetic anomaly with their toes. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4624.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4629.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4630.82s)]
*  Very strange. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4631.82s)]
*  So they have two enormous toes. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4632.82s)]
*  So their feet are completely different than ours. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4635.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4637.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4638.82s)]
*  And there's quite a few people that have that. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4639.82s)]
*  Now you could imagine that a similar genetic anomaly could take place with the shape of [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4640.82s)]
*  the skull. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4646.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4647.82s)]
*  If you could develop people that were a bunch of them, or it's a gene that can spread, like [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4648.82s)]
*  you can pass it on, that you could have something where people had a larger head and a weird [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4652.82s)]
*  shaped head. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4658.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4659.82s)]
*  That would, if it offered any sort of advantage at all, you know, you might think, well, how [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4660.82s)]
*  could that be? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4665.82s)]
*  It's, you know, obviously a problem, but if it offered any sort of advantage, like the, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4666.82s)]
*  you know, the Galapagos Islands, right? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4671.82s)]
*  The iguanas there that go down and swim in the water and eat moss off the bottom, y'all [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4673.82s)]
*  got webbed feet. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4678.82s)]
*  So it stands to reason to me that whatever happened that isolated Galapagos and made [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4680.82s)]
*  it a shitty place to try to find food for an iguana, you got one of these iguanas, it's [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4686.82s)]
*  a little mutant McNugget running around and he's got webbed toes already. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4691.82s)]
*  And he's like, fuck man, nobody wants to hang out with me because I look all weird. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4694.82s)]
*  But then this happens and all of a sudden he's the only guy that can consistently get [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4697.82s)]
*  food. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4701.82s)]
*  It's, you know, that kind of disadvantage turns advantage overnight kind of thing. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4702.82s)]
*  So those are those weird adaptations take place quicker than they thought. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4708.82s)]
*  And a good example of that is the Congo. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4713.82s)]
*  You know, there's parts of the Congo where there's an amazing BBC documentary about it. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4715.82s)]
*  It was a multiple disc CD, DVD rather thing that I had back in the day. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4720.82s)]
*  And this Congo documentary, one of the things they found was there's a lot of plains animals [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4726.82s)]
*  that got trapped in the Congo. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4731.82s)]
*  So the Congo, because of the change of the climate there, at one point in time it was [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4733.82s)]
*  plains, so it was grasslands. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4739.82s)]
*  So you have all these antelope and all these different animals that normally exist in these [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4741.82s)]
*  open wide areas, but they're jammed into a rainforest now and they've adapted. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4746.82s)]
*  And one of the animals that adapted is the diker. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4751.82s)]
*  So the diker is a small antelope that can swim underwater for as much as 100 yards and [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4754.82s)]
*  eats fish. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4759.82s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4760.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4761.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4762.82s)]
*  So this thing that lived out in the plains like all the other little antelopes now can [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4763.82s)]
*  fucking swim and dives underwater and can swim 100 yards underwater. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4768.82s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4773.82s)]
*  And eats fish. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4774.82s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4775.82s)]
*  So this weird adaptation that takes place just in the Congo, which is this incredibly [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4776.82s)]
*  vital environment that so much diversity of life exists in. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4782.82s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4787.82s)]
*  It's weird, but it's crazy how ubiquitous those things can be. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4788.82s)]
*  Like, you know, Madagascar and the lemurs. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4793.82s)]
*  Lemurs basically like have all these evolutionary niches in Madagascar filled in. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4796.82s)]
*  Like instead of a woodpecker, there's a lemur with a big ass fucking finger and he tap, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4801.82s)]
*  tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4806.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4808.82s)]
*  If we can look that guy up if you want, Jamie, the Madagascar has got almost every major [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4809.82s)]
*  evolutionary niche is filled by a lemur. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4815.82s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4817.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4818.82s)]
*  It's a fucking lemur island, man. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4819.82s)]
*  It's just like the different kinds of lemurs on Madagascar all over the place. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4820.82s)]
*  Not every single one, but like woodpeckers. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4825.82s)]
*  There's no fucking woodpeckers there. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4828.82s)]
*  The insect-eating birds are not birds. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4829.82s)]
*  They're lemurs. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4831.82s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4832.82s)]
*  The whole island is... [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4833.82s)]
*  That's it. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4836.82s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4837.82s)]
*  Look at those fucking claws. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4838.82s)]
*  How weird. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4840.82s)]
*  That looks fake. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4842.82s)]
*  The eye-eye. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4845.82s)]
*  The finger of death. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4846.82s)]
*  The world's most demonic lemur is also its most endangered. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4847.82s)]
*  Meet the creature with the ugliest finger on the planet. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4850.82s)]
*  What does it look like, the full version of it? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4852.82s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4856.82s)]
*  Look at his eyes. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4857.82s)]
*  What a cool-looking creature. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4859.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4862.82s)]
*  That's a lemur. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4863.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4864.82s)]
*  That looks like something from Lord of the Rings. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4865.82s)]
*  That does not even look like a real creature. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4867.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4869.82s)]
*  Evolution's crazy that way. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4870.82s)]
*  And it's like... [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4872.82s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4874.82s)]
*  Look at that little fucker. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4875.82s)]
*  You get a great example of like... [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4877.82s)]
*  Like you probably heard them say that [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4880.82s)]
*  the dinosaurs get wiped out and allowed mammals the opportunity to take over the planet. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4882.82s)]
*  Otherwise, mammals would have just been a bunch of shrews running around in the grass. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4886.82s)]
*  And that's that exact kind of thing. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4890.82s)]
*  It's like that lemur ain't going to out-compete woodpeckers, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4892.82s)]
*  but he don't have to. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4896.82s)]
*  So he gets to take off and do his thing. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4898.82s)]
*  Because there are no woodpeckers there. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4901.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4902.82s)]
*  So something fills that niche. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4903.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4904.82s)]
*  So it's that same kind of thing. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4905.82s)]
*  We get to see it in... [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4906.82s)]
*  You were talking about the... [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4908.82s)]
*  What's the name of that deer thing you were talking about? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4910.82s)]
*  The diker. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4912.82s)]
*  The diker. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4913.82s)]
*  It's an antelope. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4914.82s)]
*  Antelope, yes. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4915.82s)]
*  That to become an underwater meat eater, that's quite a jump. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4916.82s)]
*  But there's probably not many alligators down there doing that exact same job. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4921.82s)]
*  I mean, not many things taking its spot. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4925.82s)]
*  Otherwise, it wouldn't have been able to find a niche there. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4928.82s)]
*  There wouldn't have been no food. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4930.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4931.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4932.82s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4933.82s)]
*  There's herds of antelope running through dense rainforest, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4935.82s)]
*  running through puddles in the water and everything. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4938.82s)]
*  Really crazy, because they just sort of got trapped there. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4940.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4943.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4944.82s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4945.82s)]
*  It's like the mountains that they have in South America where they've got... [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4946.82s)]
*  Basically, it's like the same as an island where it's like nothing can go down [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4951.82s)]
*  from a certain elevation. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4955.82s)]
*  So there's a bunch of things that live up in the mountains [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4957.82s)]
*  that are basically evolutionary isolated [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4960.82s)]
*  and have been for 10,000, 20,000 years. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4962.82s)]
*  And so you've got a bunch of goofy species that are only... [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4965.82s)]
*  Next mountain over there a little bit different, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4968.82s)]
*  next mountain over there a little bit different. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4970.82s)]
*  Same as the finches that Darwin was chasing around in the early days. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4972.82s)]
*  Pretty interesting stuff. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4975.82s)]
*  I can nerd out on all that shit for a long time. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4977.82s)]
*  I love it. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4979.82s)]
*  But just the sheer variety, the sheer variety of life forms that we know are real. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4980.82s)]
*  And what's interesting is things that are cryptic or cryptozoology type deals [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4985.82s)]
*  people are so dismissive of them. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4991.82s)]
*  But I'm like, by God, there's so much that's real. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4993.82s)]
*  There's so much that's real. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4996.82s)]
*  One of my favorites is the little hobbit man from the island Flores [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=4998.82s)]
*  because that was dismissed forever. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5002.82s)]
*  That was just nonsense until a couple decades ago. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5004.82s)]
*  They're like, oh, hey, okay. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5007.82s)]
*  We just found something that's like a little tiny person, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5010.82s)]
*  a little three-foot person that's not us, but it's bipedal. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5012.82s)]
*  And it seems to have worked with tools and hunted. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5017.82s)]
*  It's funny how skeptical they get with the stuff. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5020.82s)]
*  Where it's not even skeptical, it's cynical. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5024.82s)]
*  Because clearly, we know that island dwarfism exists, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5027.82s)]
*  which is where things get smaller or bigger on islands, depending. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5031.82s)]
*  You might have some big-ass swans and some small elephants on an island. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5034.82s)]
*  Yeah, lizards get bigger, right? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5037.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5039.82s)]
*  Smaller things tend to get bigger and bigger things tend to get smaller. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5040.82s)]
*  So we know that's a thing. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5043.82s)]
*  Why is it a problem to assume that that would happen with humans or with hominids? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5045.82s)]
*  Right, we know what happens with elephants, dwarf elephants on these islands. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5050.82s)]
*  And that's the kind of thing that honestly sounds like religious thinking, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5053.82s)]
*  not scientific thinking to me. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5059.82s)]
*  It's like, we're better, and we're immune to all the same forces of nature. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5061.82s)]
*  It's like a scientist would just should just be like, okay, man, it could be. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5065.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's just ego. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5069.82s)]
*  It's ego. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5071.82s)]
*  Ego works with everything in the wrong direction, including science. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5072.82s)]
*  And well, that's to me, that's kind of it's kind of fucked. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5076.82s)]
*  Because even though I know that those guys, like I was saying earlier, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5082.82s)]
*  are socially awkward and probably emotionally stunted quite frequently, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5084.82s)]
*  can't even suss their own feelings. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5088.82s)]
*  But at the same time, it's like science is the whole fucking expedition, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5090.82s)]
*  the whole undertaking, the whole reason you do it is to see clearly. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5097.82s)]
*  And when trying to get rid of Joe has an opinion, Jamie has an opinion, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5101.82s)]
*  Dan has an opinion, they're all different. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5105.82s)]
*  But if we all see the same thing, we can be pretty sure that this is real. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5107.82s)]
*  But if I see it different than you, than Jamie will now. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5111.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5114.82s)]
*  And so when they inject their ego heavily into it, political, quite frequently nowadays, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5115.82s)]
*  it's it's not fucking science anymore. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5120.82s)]
*  You are defiling the thing that you set out to do. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5123.82s)]
*  You know you're doing it. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5126.82s)]
*  So I get kind of let's just call it truth. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5127.82s)]
*  Like truth is the most valuable thing. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5129.82s)]
*  If you're speaking openly about something, if you're talking about something publicly, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5131.82s)]
*  truth is the most important thing. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5135.82s)]
*  As soon as you are willing to violate truth to preserve something else, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5137.82s)]
*  like your status, your ego, your place in the hierarchy of information. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5141.82s)]
*  Well, now I can't listen to you anymore. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5147.82s)]
*  I know you're willing to lie. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5149.82s)]
*  You're a grifter. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5150.82s)]
*  Yeah. And obviously politics is the best example of that. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5151.82s)]
*  I mean, especially today. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5154.82s)]
*  I guess it's probably a good time to talk about this. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5156.82s)]
*  There was a thing that came out recently. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5159.82s)]
*  There was a book that was some book about the Kamala Harris campaign, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5161.82s)]
*  but they talked about her getting on the show. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5165.82s)]
*  And they said a bunch of things that weren't true. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5167.82s)]
*  They talked to supposedly talked to like 150 different people about her [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5169.82s)]
*  and what happened with her coming on the show. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5174.82s)]
*  I don't know if it's 150, a lot of people. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5177.82s)]
*  They didn't talk to us and which is kind of crazy. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5179.82s)]
*  And it was just like they didn't even ask. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5183.82s)]
*  But they said things that just weren't true. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5186.82s)]
*  One of the things that said that weren't true was that we lied about the day [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5189.82s)]
*  that Trump was coming on. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5194.82s)]
*  No, we just didn't tell you that Trump was coming on. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5196.82s)]
*  He was already booked a long time ago. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5198.82s)]
*  This is how it worked. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5200.82s)]
*  Trump was really easy to book, like super easy. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5201.82s)]
*  We offered one day. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5204.82s)]
*  He said, yes, that was it. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5206.82s)]
*  There was no what are we going to talk about? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5208.82s)]
*  How long is it going to be? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5210.82s)]
*  Is it going to be edited? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5211.82s)]
*  There was nothing. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5212.82s)]
*  What's the waiver here? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5213.82s)]
*  Give me that waiver. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5215.82s)]
*  Sign it. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5216.82s)]
*  It was so easy. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5217.82s)]
*  So he was already booked. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5218.82s)]
*  They never committed to doing the show. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5219.82s)]
*  So all this talk, there was nothing. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5222.82s)]
*  They said that the reason why they did the Beyonce thing, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5223.82s)]
*  the Beyonce event in Houston was so that they could be in Texas to do my show. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5225.82s)]
*  They never agreed to do the show. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5230.82s)]
*  None of that's true. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5232.82s)]
*  They never agreed. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5233.82s)]
*  That's fucked. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5234.82s)]
*  They also said that they sent someone down here to the studio to do a walkthrough of the set. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5235.82s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5241.82s)]
*  The Trump administration did. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5242.82s)]
*  I mean, if they are trying to say that they, as in the entire federal government, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5244.82s)]
*  well, I don't think the Trump administration, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5249.82s)]
*  well, I guess the Secret Service is a part of the federal government. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5250.82s)]
*  Maybe you can kind of get away with saying that because the Secret Service came down here for Trump [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5254.82s)]
*  and looked around that we sent someone down, but it was not. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5259.82s)]
*  It was the Trump administration sent them down [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5262.82s)]
*  because they're the only ones that had a date to do the show. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5264.82s)]
*  These people didn't have a date to do. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5267.82s)]
*  They never agreed to do the show. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5268.82s)]
*  This is really important. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5270.82s)]
*  Even after Trump went on, they offered for me to come to D.C. and do a show with Kamala. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5272.82s)]
*  But even then, it was the same deal. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5278.82s)]
*  It was only like 45 minutes to an hour. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5280.82s)]
*  And, you know, it was not on my set. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5284.82s)]
*  And I said that, look, he did it here. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5287.82s)]
*  We should probably do it here. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5289.82s)]
*  Like, if it's possible to do it here. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5291.82s)]
*  Obviously, when he did it, it had an enormous result. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5292.82s)]
*  I'm willing to do the same thing for her. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5295.82s)]
*  I wanted to release both of them on the same day. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5296.82s)]
*  This was my goal. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5299.82s)]
*  I was even trying to figure out if there was a way that I could do it. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5300.82s)]
*  And I even offered to do it late that night. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5304.82s)]
*  So the night that Trump came on, I'm like, what if we do her like when she's done in Texas, if she came here? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5306.82s)]
*  But no one ever committed to doing it. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5313.82s)]
*  This is really important because they keep pretending that I lied or I did this or I did that. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5315.82s)]
*  No one. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5319.82s)]
*  They never committed to doing it. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5320.82s)]
*  We offered we went through I've got a whole. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5321.82s)]
*  But we have all the receipts, by the way, of course, have a whole list of conversations that took place. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5324.82s)]
*  They never said she was going to do it. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5331.82s)]
*  So this whole idea that we fucked her over and then we we fucked her over for Trump. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5333.82s)]
*  Incorrect. Just not true. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5337.82s)]
*  And, you know, but I think it's someone trying to cover their ass for the fact that she never did it. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5339.82s)]
*  And if she did do it, it might have had a positive effect. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5345.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5347.82s)]
*  If her and I had a good time and we got along great and she went over, you know, the air quote young male vote, things could have been different. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5348.82s)]
*  So this guy's probably trying to cover his ass. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5355.82s)]
*  That's I was that's what I'm thinking, too, is because the reaction to her not coming was like pretty big. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5357.82s)]
*  But they didn't commit to doing it. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5364.82s)]
*  This is the thing. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5366.82s)]
*  Why? While this guy's saying like that, we were difficult to deal with. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5367.82s)]
*  Not true. We were super easy. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5370.82s)]
*  We made it real clear. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5372.82s)]
*  But also, it's got to be the actual real show. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5374.82s)]
*  It shouldn't be some fake version of it where I'm sitting in a conference room. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5378.82s)]
*  Oh, also, they wanted a stenographer in the room. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5382.82s)]
*  They wanted staff in the room. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5385.82s)]
*  They want Trump was just in here by himself. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5387.82s)]
*  Just me, him and Jamie. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5389.82s)]
*  That's it for three hours. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5390.82s)]
*  Like they wanted to do everything. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5392.82s)]
*  They wanted it very controlled and they were really concerned that it wasn't going to be edited. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5393.82s)]
*  So I don't think they ever really were sure they wanted to do it. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5397.82s)]
*  Then once Trump did it and it had this huge response, I think then it was like, what the fuck? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5401.82s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5406.82s)]
*  He just did it. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5407.82s)]
*  It's got 50 fucking million views. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5408.82s)]
*  This is so stupid. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5409.82s)]
*  Why didn't we do it? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5410.82s)]
*  And so then there was even then when they offered to do it in D.C., my manager asked, is she committed to doing this? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5411.82s)]
*  When I bring if I bring this to Joe? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5418.82s)]
*  No, she hasn't committed to doing this. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5420.82s)]
*  Have you brought this to her? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5422.82s)]
*  Like they wouldn't even say whether or not she had expressed willingness to do it or whether they were trying to convince her to do it. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5423.82s)]
*  There was we know for sure there were some people that were supposedly on her staff that were against her doing it. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5431.82s)]
*  They thought it was a bad because, you know, it's a bunch of wokesters. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5438.82s)]
*  They're basically in a cult. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5440.82s)]
*  You're you have a district. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5442.82s)]
*  Look, if you're willing to go on Fox News, you talk to what's that guy's name? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5444.82s)]
*  Brett Breyer? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5448.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5449.82s)]
*  Where they cut that off after 20 minutes when they did that. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5450.82s)]
*  That's when I was like, look, it's got to be in the studio. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5454.82s)]
*  It's got to be in the studio and it's got to be real. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5456.82s)]
*  It's got to be a real conversation. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5458.82s)]
*  I had entertained a couple of times going to it, but I'm like, 45 minutes is just not enough. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5459.82s)]
*  You know, you and I have been talking an hour and a half already. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5464.82s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's just like it's not enough time. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5467.82s)]
*  You need more time. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5469.82s)]
*  You need more time to find out what makes someone tick. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5470.82s)]
*  And that's probably what she was afraid of. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5473.82s)]
*  Probably what they were afraid of. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5476.82s)]
*  Maybe not. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5477.82s)]
*  Maybe not. I think they should have been. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5478.82s)]
*  I think we would have had a good old time. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5480.82s)]
*  No, you're you're a good guy. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5481.82s)]
*  I think we would have had fun. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5483.82s)]
*  I think I think it was a huge, huge mistake on her part. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5484.82s)]
*  And let's be honest, like it's the kind of thing that it's reminiscent of the forget the congressman that asked Mark Zuckerberg how how Facebook makes money. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5488.82s)]
*  It's just like they're so just so detached from the modern world. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5496.82s)]
*  It's like you you could spend millions of dollars on all your ad campaign all across YouTube or you could just go sit in the room with Joe for three hours. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5499.82s)]
*  I'll tell you which one's going to do better for you, lady. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5506.82s)]
*  But she picked the ad campaigns on YouTube. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5509.82s)]
*  The problem is that I think the people that saw it as they thought they were going to win anyway, apparently. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5512.82s)]
*  And the people that saw it as a negative thought like there's been a few blunders where things didn't go well. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5517.82s)]
*  But I think a lot of those blunders are I was listening to this woman on the Tucker Carlson show and she was talking about what Biden was like during the presidency. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5523.82s)]
*  And one of the things that she said, I thought that was very interesting, was that there's many people that worked with Biden that said there were moments in his first couple of years where he was very lucid and that he would be actually running the meetings and he had talking points that were written down. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5533.82s)]
*  But he was having these lucid conversations and then he would do these public things and he would have blunders. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5550.82s)]
*  I think a lot of it is just the pressure of performing publicly under intense scrutiny. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5556.82s)]
*  Like if you have to do a live set, like say if you have to do Saturday Night Live or something like that and you're going to do a monologue, the pressure of doing that monologue is so much different than the pressure of just going up at a local comedy club. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5562.82s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5574.82s)]
*  I think that pressure, Joe Biden as much as I'm sure he has a high self-opinion, clearly, when he is confronted by the reality that half the country hates him and thinks he's doing a terrible job and then he has to talk publicly live, then I think those cognitive problems were sort of elevated. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5576.82s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5595.82s)]
*  I think that's the same with her. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5596.82s)]
*  So I think that's the same with her when she's on Fox with Brett Breyer. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5597.82s)]
*  I think it's hostile environments. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5601.82s)]
*  I think it's large crowds. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5603.82s)]
*  I think it's a lot of things where you don't get to see the real person. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5605.82s)]
*  So that was my goal. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5608.82s)]
*  My goal was to try to meet the real person. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5609.82s)]
*  Just like I did with Trump, just try to meet and talk with the real person. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5612.82s)]
*  And my goal was what I really wanted to do, which we talked about this quite a bit, me and my manager, of doing it on the same day. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5615.82s)]
*  And my manager, she agreed. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5622.82s)]
*  She like, this would be the perfect way to set it up. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5623.82s)]
*  Like we both agree. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5626.82s)]
*  Put them both out at the same time. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5627.82s)]
*  You know, go watch them all. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5629.82s)]
*  See what you think. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5631.82s)]
*  That would be the ultimate way to do it. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5632.82s)]
*  But they didn't never they never agreed to do it. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5634.82s)]
*  So all this shit that's in that book that they never talked to us, just not true. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5636.82s)]
*  Maybe it's someone's trying to preserve their job. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5641.82s)]
*  Maybe someone's trying to say, hey, it wasn't my fault. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5643.82s)]
*  You know, they became difficult. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5646.82s)]
*  No, we didn't become difficult. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5648.82s)]
*  The other thing was like they wanted to do it that Saturday, the day after Trump. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5649.82s)]
*  And I said, I'll do it. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5652.82s)]
*  But it has to be at 830 a.m. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5653.82s)]
*  The reason why was I had a podcast already scheduled that was a live UFC podcast. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5655.82s)]
*  So we do this thing called Fight Companion. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5661.82s)]
*  So there was this title fight that was happening in I think was it Saudi Arabia or was it Dubai or Abu Dhabi? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5663.82s)]
*  Some it was somewhere in the Middle East, I believe, if I remember correctly. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5671.82s)]
*  See if you can find out what that was. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5674.82s)]
*  Just so just we were clear. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5675.82s)]
*  I have friends. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5677.82s)]
*  I flew in three of my buddies from California and we were all going to do this podcast together. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5679.82s)]
*  Like we had committed to doing this like they were already in town. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5684.82s)]
*  Like I can't just say no, guys. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5687.82s)]
*  I can't do this awesome thing because I have to interview Kamala Harris. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5690.82s)]
*  No, I understand. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5693.82s)]
*  Seems like I should to some people. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5694.82s)]
*  But that's because you're in the politics business. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5696.82s)]
*  I'm an MMA commentator. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5698.82s)]
*  This is part of my job. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5700.82s)]
*  And I said I would do it. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5701.82s)]
*  I said I'll do it. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5702.82s)]
*  But it has to be like 830 in the morning because I have to be done by the time the fight start. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5703.82s)]
*  That's reasonable. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5707.82s)]
*  They didn't do that either. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5708.82s)]
*  So this idea that I sabotage her, there's a bunch of people that say I fucked her over or whatever. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5710.82s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5715.82s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5716.82s)]
*  So you can think whatever you want. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5717.82s)]
*  But it was Abu Dhabi. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5719.82s)]
*  So that was Ilya Toporia versus Max Holloway. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5720.82s)]
*  So for UFC fans, just so just so you know, for people listening that aren't UFC fans, that was a huge fight. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5723.82s)]
*  That was a gigantic fight. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5730.82s)]
*  Max Holloway just beat Justin Gaethjeen, like literally the knockout of all time. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5731.82s)]
*  And Ilya Toporia is one of the absolute best fighters on planet Earth, if not number one pound for pounds, certainly number two. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5737.82s)]
*  Or number three. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5745.82s)]
*  So he's in the top five of the absolute best athletes in any weight class. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5746.82s)]
*  So this was a clash of the Titans, the greatest featherweight champion of all time versus the current featherweight champion. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5751.82s)]
*  So I'm not going to miss that. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5757.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5758.82s)]
*  I understand. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5759.82s)]
*  I work around you. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5760.82s)]
*  I said I would do it at night. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5761.82s)]
*  I'll come back. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5762.82s)]
*  I'll do it at midnight. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5763.82s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5764.82s)]
*  I'll do it. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5765.82s)]
*  So it wasn't me fucking someone over. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5766.82s)]
*  And so just whoever's in charge of spreading that narrative, that's deceptive. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5770.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5776.82s)]
*  And she she missed out. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5777.82s)]
*  Man, she could have sat in the same chair that Shane Gillis sat in. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5778.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5781.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5782.82s)]
*  He says it's that one. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5783.82s)]
*  Or it could have been a wreck. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5784.82s)]
*  But it could have been a wreck with Trump, too. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5787.82s)]
*  You know, like there was there was a moment where me and Trump were I was saying, tell me how the 2020 election was stolen. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5789.82s)]
*  Like and I feel like if you're for the last four years have been telling everybody that they robbed you, you should be able to tell people how you know they robbed you. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5796.82s)]
*  And you should be able to say it. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5805.82s)]
*  Articulate it. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5806.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5807.82s)]
*  Clearly. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5808.82s)]
*  Clearly. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5809.82s)]
*  I don't I don't. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5810.82s)]
*  So I don't know what that's about. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5811.82s)]
*  I don't know if he has other people that tell him that he's compartmentalized. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5812.82s)]
*  Like, look, you hey, Rudy Giuliani, you deal with that. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5815.82s)]
*  I got other shit to deal with. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5818.82s)]
*  I'm going to deal with this. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5819.82s)]
*  You tell me they robbed me. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5820.82s)]
*  I'm going to say they robbed me. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5821.82s)]
*  That could be it. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5822.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5823.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5824.82s)]
*  But so that could have gone sideways. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5825.82s)]
*  But it didn't. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5826.82s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5827.82s)]
*  It goes back to that. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5828.82s)]
*  How you disagree with people think. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5829.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5831.82s)]
*  You don't have to be an asshole about it. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5832.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5833.82s)]
*  You should be able to communicate with people in a way that it's just about what you're talking about. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5834.82s)]
*  It's not a it's a shitty tactic to try to break a person down as a human being because you want to enforce your argument or say their argument sucks because they suck as a human being, too. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5839.82s)]
*  Like, come on. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5849.82s)]
*  We're we're big grownups here. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5850.82s)]
*  We can just talk about the actual ideas. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5851.82s)]
*  I mean, we actually get to where we're trying to get to. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5853.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5855.82s)]
*  We're trying to figure out the other side of this. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5856.82s)]
*  So seems kind of cut and dry. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5857.82s)]
*  But a lot of people miss that the egos are egos a powerful fucking thing. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5860.82s)]
*  It really is. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5863.82s)]
*  And it I mean, I'm glad we took that little side trip because I had to explain that. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5864.82s)]
*  But the the thing is that that little monster rears its ugly head in everything. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5869.82s)]
*  It doesn't just rear its ugly head in politics. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5876.82s)]
*  It rears its ugly head in archaeology, in religion, in culture, in everything we do. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5880.82s)]
*  It just it's a lot of it is I have said this for so long. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5887.82s)]
*  I don't want to ever say I was wrong. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5891.82s)]
*  And I will I will somehow or another derail any arguments against me. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5893.82s)]
*  I will call those people racist. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5899.82s)]
*  I will call those people. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5901.82s)]
*  I was watching one of your videos where there's this person who listened to what Flint Dibble said about Graham Hancock and Atlantis and connecting Atlantis to white supremacy. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5902.82s)]
*  And she made the most distorted statement that saying that people of color were not capable that this is the argument of the people that support Atlantis. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5914.82s)]
*  People of color were not capable of that sort of civilization, which literally no one has ever said, because everybody, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5924.82s)]
*  especially the people that believe that that area of Sub-Saharan Africa, the right shart, right shot, right shot. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5931.82s)]
*  How do you say I think I think it's right shot, right shot structure that that is that that is Egypt or that is rather Atlantis. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5938.82s)]
*  That is literally in Africa. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5945.82s)]
*  So who the fuck do you think built it? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5947.82s)]
*  If you're talking about the pyramids, no one is saying Europeans came to Africa and built appearance. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5949.82s)]
*  The Africans built the pyramids. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5954.82s)]
*  So it none of this white supremacy thing makes any sense because all these people are saying was I think that this city in Africa was Atlantis. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5956.82s)]
*  I think which if you're going to find an ancient civilization that is super advanced, wouldn't you think maybe you would be in an area around where there's fucking for sure ancient advanced civilizations that made pyramids? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5967.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a no brainer. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5980.82s)]
*  It's kind of a no brainer. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5982.82s)]
*  What they what they do is they this is where Flint is especially in cities. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5983.82s)]
*  You know, I got a I got a long well with Flint and a bunch of other archaeologists for a long time. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5988.82s)]
*  But I made a video that went into the details of how Ignatius Donnelly was not the guy who founded modern day Atlantis hunting. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=5992.82s)]
*  And he he did believe in some kind of Aryan first things. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6001.82s)]
*  And it was he didn't he believed that other races weren't capable of innovating. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6005.82s)]
*  And he was just one douchebag. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6009.82s)]
*  He was popular. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6011.82s)]
*  But the thing is, is people that came before they tried to make it out like the guys that came before him both believe the Maya were the founded one of them believe the Maya fucking whooped the ass all the way over into Indian shit. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6012.82s)]
*  He believed that the Maya were the Egyptians. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6026.82s)]
*  What? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6028.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6029.82s)]
*  Augustus Le Plonon is the one that believed the Maya whooped ass all over the world. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6030.82s)]
*  And the other one was with a Maya supposedly seafaring. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6034.82s)]
*  No, this is this is his. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6038.82s)]
*  He's a wacky idea. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6040.82s)]
*  Well, Charles, a teen, the Brazil de Bobo. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6041.82s)]
*  These are the two guys that they were the first ones to find like that Chocmul statue with the weird and the heart and the plate. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6044.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6051.82s)]
*  It looks Egyptian. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6052.82s)]
*  They were the ones that started seeing they're the first ones to see the similarities between these things. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6053.82s)]
*  And so they believe that, you know, ancient Egypt is this technologically superior place. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6058.82s)]
*  And here we've seen the same thing here with similar iconography. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6063.82s)]
*  So I made a video explaining that this is the essay that the letter that the Society for American Archaeology wrote to Netflix to call Graham Hancock a racist, basically not call him a racist. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6067.82s)]
*  Fuck you guys. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6078.82s)]
*  Is it was wrong. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6080.82s)]
*  They were as erroneous. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6083.82s)]
*  It contained false information. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6084.82s)]
*  And I pointed that out. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6085.82s)]
*  And eventually, Flint's addressed it. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6086.82s)]
*  His argument was, well, it doesn't really matter. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6089.82s)]
*  It's not a big deal. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6091.82s)]
*  We use the word comet and and Graham talks about a comet and these this other guy didn't. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6092.82s)]
*  And it doesn't really matter because so many white supremacists believe this shit anyway. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6097.82s)]
*  And it was just like at that point, I was kind of like, OK, this isn't science anymore. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6101.82s)]
*  And then I watched him do that waffle and bullshit here where he did it with great when you were pushing him on it. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6106.82s)]
*  And he's like, no, I didn't say that. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6112.82s)]
*  Well, yeah, I said, well, no, I didn't say that was just already. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6113.82s)]
*  I'm going to drag you for this. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6116.82s)]
*  There's too many people that are used to being in a position of authority where they're never questioned like that. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6117.82s)]
*  And they can say that in front of a class or they can say that in front of colleagues and nobody pushes back. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6122.82s)]
*  And then there's also this problem with leftist ideology where if someone if there is some sort of history at any point in time of white supremacy like that Ignatius Donnelly guy, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6127.82s)]
*  you have to connect even everything attached to the theories of this advanced city, this advanced law civilization. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6142.82s)]
*  You have to attach it to white supremacy or you are a racist or you're enabling or you're a dog whistling, which is my favorite dog whistling. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6151.82s)]
*  It's just insane. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6158.82s)]
*  I hear racism. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6161.82s)]
*  I hear racism. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6162.82s)]
*  God, I'm a gool lynching. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6164.82s)]
*  It's so dumb because, listen, if you have a place like Egypt, that's way crazier than Atlantis. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6166.82s)]
*  You already have a place that's fucking insane. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6175.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6178.82s)]
*  That's way crazier because whatever Atlantis had, it didn't survive whatever that if that right chart structure, if that's really where it is and it was impacted by the Great Flood, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6179.82s)]
*  by the end of the Younger Trius, the impact theory, the water from all the polar caps rushes through and destroys everything and giant tsunamis everywhere because the global cataclysm. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6190.82s)]
*  OK, it's well it wasn't as good because if that's the pyramids are still standing. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6201.82s)]
*  So that all that shit happened at the same time the pyramids, too. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6206.82s)]
*  So that what you're saying, if you really believe all that, is that the pyramids were way more advanced than Atlantis. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6209.82s)]
*  And believing Atlantis is crazy. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6216.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6218.82s)]
*  Help me out. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6219.82s)]
*  And it's white supremacy, even though it's in the same part of the fucking world. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6220.82s)]
*  Help me out. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6224.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's always always basically no matter what, they're always going to find a way to not just dismiss it. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6225.82s)]
*  They're going to poo poo it. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6232.82s)]
*  They're going to turn that. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6233.82s)]
*  That's not enough. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6236.82s)]
*  That's not an underwater monkey. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6237.82s)]
*  That doesn't look like a tool to me. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6238.82s)]
*  It's just this this poo poo attitude that really it does them a huge disservice because ultimately the most interested amateurs on the planet would be us. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6240.82s)]
*  Pyramid, it's guys that are into that kind of goofy shit. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6253.82s)]
*  We're the most interested. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6256.82s)]
*  Just like Carl Sagan knew his audience, the most interested people in space were the UFO crowd. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6258.82s)]
*  The most interested people in archaeology are not archaeology students. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6263.82s)]
*  That's their nine to five. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6268.82s)]
*  I'm the one that's reading the shit at two o'clock in the morning with the beer in my hand. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6269.82s)]
*  I love the shit, but I don't want it. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6272.82s)]
*  You're going to bore me if you talk about stratigraphy. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6275.82s)]
*  We're going to want a story. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6277.82s)]
*  We're going to want you going to want something to excite mystery to dig into it. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6279.82s)]
*  So when they literally deliberately piss on the mysteries, it's like, oh, there's no there's nothing to see here. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6283.82s)]
*  Nothing to see here. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6288.82s)]
*  Nothing to see here. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6289.82s)]
*  Let me tell you about stratigraphy. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6290.82s)]
*  Nothing to see here. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6291.82s)]
*  That's why I talk about Carl Sagan all the time. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6292.82s)]
*  He might have laughed in their face. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6294.82s)]
*  But he never told me nothing to see here. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6297.82s)]
*  We know why Carl Sagan smoked a lot of weed. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6299.82s)]
*  He did. He smoked a lot of weed. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6301.82s)]
*  That's very uncomfortable for a lot of people that don't like weed. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6302.82s)]
*  Oh, makes you lazy. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6305.82s)]
*  Nope. You were already lazy. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6306.82s)]
*  We just got there while you were lazy. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6308.82s)]
*  There's nothing to do with weed. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6310.82s)]
*  Stop it. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6312.82s)]
*  You know, it's true. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6313.82s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6314.82s)]
*  It's a lot of people like to blame things for blame. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6315.82s)]
*  Say the drugs are all just bad, but I forget the dude's name. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6319.82s)]
*  Like was the guy that discerned the DNA like the human DNA. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6323.82s)]
*  Francis Crick. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6326.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6327.82s)]
*  And Kerry Mullis. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6328.82s)]
*  Did it well on LSD. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6329.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6330.82s)]
*  Like, crack the code on LSD or whatever. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6331.82s)]
*  I mean, that shit's, you know, it's part of our brains, man. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6332.82s)]
*  It's there. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6335.82s)]
*  And as a tribe. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6336.82s)]
*  I think there's some controversy about the Francis Crick thing though, right? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6338.82s)]
*  Isn't there a controversy about whether Francis Crick was a pretty sure Kerry Mullis was open when he was talking about the PCR method that he devised that when he was on acid, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6341.82s)]
*  which is also also he was a huge critic of using that stuff for detecting diseases. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6352.82s)]
*  He's like, this is so fucking stupid. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6359.82s)]
*  Like you don't know. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6361.82s)]
*  Like he was so angry. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6362.82s)]
*  And you ever see that video where he's angry about Anthony Fauci saying he does not know what he's doing. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6363.82s)]
*  He's not a scientist. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6367.82s)]
*  He's a bureaucrat. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6368.82s)]
*  See if you can find that video because it's fascinating because he's literally talking about this is pre-COVID by the way. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6369.82s)]
*  OK, he's because he died like right or right before COVID happened. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6373.82s)]
*  But he was talking about how PCR should never be used to detect diseases because you could find these tiny fragments of a disease. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6377.82s)]
*  But it doesn't even mean that someone's infected, especially when you're ramping it up to X amount of cycles like that. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6384.82s)]
*  So many cycles. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6390.82s)]
*  You had so many false positives that maybe someone had encountered this thing at one point in time, but it was dormant in their body and dead. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6391.82s)]
*  But yet you're still you're looking at such minute particles that you can't use it to detect whether or not someone's sick. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6399.82s)]
*  And that's what we're using during the pandemic to detect whether or not. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6407.82s)]
*  So you got so many false positives. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6411.82s)]
*  You know, some estimates were higher than 50 percent false positives. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6413.82s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6417.82s)]
*  Insane. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6418.82s)]
*  See, you find Kary Mullis on Anthony Fauci. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6419.82s)]
*  He's like sitting at a desk at his kitchen table or he's sitting at his kitchen table with a guy he's talking to. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6422.82s)]
*  And he's just breaking down the difference between the actual science. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6428.82s)]
*  Have you found it? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6433.82s)]
*  It's only a preview of the video. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6435.82s)]
*  I know it's available. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6436.82s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6438.82s)]
*  I'm just looking. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6439.82s)]
*  You're timing it. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6440.82s)]
*  I'm stuck in. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6441.82s)]
*  No, I understand. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6442.82s)]
*  Preview site. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6443.82s)]
*  Now I've got to find another one. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6444.82s)]
*  Just I'm finding. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6445.82s)]
*  OK, you'll find it. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6446.82s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6447.82s)]
*  I got to double check and make sure to see if this is not what you want. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6448.82s)]
*  But that's it right there. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6452.82s)]
*  Second one down. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6453.82s)]
*  Ten seconds. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6454.82s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6455.82s)]
*  This is Russia. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6456.82s)]
*  It says Russia? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6457.82s)]
*  Yandex.ru. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6458.82s)]
*  Oh, you're going to get a fucking virus. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6459.82s)]
*  There it is. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6462.82s)]
*  Change your computer to Russian script first. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6463.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's it. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6466.82s)]
*  So this is Kary Mullis. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6469.82s)]
*  Won a Nobel Prize for his PCR technique while employed by Emeryville Biotech firm. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6471.82s)]
*  This is about humanity. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6478.82s)]
*  It wants to go to all the details and stuff. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6480.82s)]
*  These guys like Fowchee get up there and start talking. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6483.82s)]
*  He doesn't know anything really about anything. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6486.82s)]
*  And I'd say that to his face. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6488.82s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6490.82s)]
*  The man thinks you can take a blood sample and stick it in an electron microscope. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6491.82s)]
*  And if it's got a virus in there, you'll know it. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6495.82s)]
*  He doesn't understand electron microscopy. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6497.82s)]
*  He doesn't understand medicine. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6500.82s)]
*  He should not be in a position like he's in. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6502.82s)]
*  Most of those guys up there on the top are just total administrative people. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6504.82s)]
*  And they don't know anything about what's going on on the bottom. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6509.82s)]
*  Those guys have got an agenda, which is not what we would like them to have, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6511.82s)]
*  being that we pay for them to take care of our health in some way. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6517.82s)]
*  They've got a personal kind of agenda. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6520.82s)]
*  They make up their own rules as they go. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6523.82s)]
*  They change them when they want to. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6525.82s)]
*  And they smuggle it like Tony Fowchee does not mind going on television [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6526.82s)]
*  in front of the people who pay his salary and lie directly into the camera. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6529.82s)]
*  You can't expect the sheep. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6533.82s)]
*  What is this? [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6536.82s)]
*  So this was pre-pandemic. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6537.82s)]
*  Yeah, 96 it says. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6539.82s)]
*  That's brutal. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6540.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6541.82s)]
*  So what he's talking about, I think back then, was also the AIDS crisis, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6542.82s)]
*  which that's a whole other ball of wax. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6547.82s)]
*  And if you want to get into that at another time, folks, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6549.82s)]
*  just please go read Bobby Kennedy's book, The Real Anthony Fowchee. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6552.82s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6555.82s)]
*  But so this is another thing. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6557.82s)]
*  This is more gatekeeping. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6559.82s)]
*  It's the same kind of thing. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6560.82s)]
*  This may be in a different way, maybe not to protect the ego, but to protect money. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6562.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6566.82s)]
*  One of the things with COVID that always tickles me on that is the way that [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6567.82s)]
*  they threw the, I feel to me, I feel like they threw the red herring of a mask at us. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6573.82s)]
*  I feel like the mask was a bullfighter's cape. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6578.82s)]
*  I feel like you've only got so many hours in a day. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6584.82s)]
*  You've got to pick your battles and you've got the mask is an easy symbol. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6587.82s)]
*  Everybody can complain about it because it affects everybody. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6592.82s)]
*  It's an easy touchstone. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6595.82s)]
*  You can see it. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6596.82s)]
*  But while everybody's fighting that, it really is effectively, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6597.82s)]
*  you just have to fucking wear a hat for a few months or a few years. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6601.82s)]
*  They're closing down our stores and taking the kids. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6604.82s)]
*  I got two more years of wrestling. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6607.82s)]
*  Yeah, fuck you. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6609.82s)]
*  You're not ever going to make state fuck you. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6610.82s)]
*  That's the stuff that was getting lost. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6612.82s)]
*  The masks, I'll wear fucking masks over my face today if it'll bring back White Elephant shit. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6615.82s)]
*  There's also no logical explanation. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6620.82s)]
*  If the vaccine worked, give it to the people that are vulnerable. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6623.82s)]
*  Let everybody else live their life. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6626.82s)]
*  That makes the most sense. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6628.82s)]
*  But they couldn't do that. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6629.82s)]
*  They had to pretend that the other people were vulnerable. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6630.82s)]
*  They had to pretend the children were dying of it. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6633.82s)]
*  They talked about it all the time. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6635.82s)]
*  No healthy children died of it. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6636.82s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6637.82s)]
*  They tried to pretend that it was really dangerous for young people. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6638.82s)]
*  It wasn't unless they were already really sick. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6641.82s)]
*  What it exposed in this country is that there are a lot of people that are completely full of shit [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6644.82s)]
*  that are in charge of telling us what the truth is. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6649.82s)]
*  And that also, we're really vulnerable in terms of our health. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6651.82s)]
*  Our health is very vulnerable. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6655.82s)]
*  Our economy is very vulnerable. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6656.82s)]
*  We can't just shut the country down for a year and a half. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6657.82s)]
*  It doesn't work like that. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6659.82s)]
*  We're vulnerable. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6660.82s)]
*  It destroyed a lot of businesses. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6661.82s)]
*  It destroyed people's lives. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6662.82s)]
*  It caused so many people to become drug addicts. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6664.82s)]
*  So many people to commit suicide. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6666.82s)]
*  There's a loss of life and a loss of hope. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6667.82s)]
*  Who knows what it's going to do to these young children that had to wear masks when they were in preschool. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6670.82s)]
*  Who knows what the fuck that does to you? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6674.82s)]
*  Learning how to talk with a mask on. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6676.82s)]
*  You're not reading mouths and lips and you're not getting a full facial feature to read off like children need for their development. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6678.82s)]
*  We found out that there's a lot of people that just aren't telling you the fucking truth. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6685.82s)]
*  And the crazy thing is they were doing it in the age of the Internet because they had been used to doing it for so long. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6689.82s)]
*  They didn't develop the thing that people have now. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6694.82s)]
*  Like now, especially someone like you or I who does stuff on YouTube, you know that if you say something and it's not true, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6698.82s)]
*  you got to go back and say, hey, this is what I thought. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6705.82s)]
*  This is why I thought it. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6708.82s)]
*  But now I know that this isn't true. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6710.82s)]
*  Because if you don't do that, no one's ever going to fucking trust you again. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6711.82s)]
*  Anthony Fauci in the beginning of the pandemic, like don't wear a mask. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6715.82s)]
*  It doesn't do anything. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6718.82s)]
*  It's just anything it's going to smuts with it. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6720.82s)]
*  And then later he's saying, wear a mask. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6723.82s)]
*  I wear two. I wear two masks. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6725.82s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6727.82s)]
*  We have video, man. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6728.82s)]
*  This is this is a different time. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6730.82s)]
*  This is in 1986. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6732.82s)]
*  You can't just go and tell us some shit. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6733.82s)]
*  And we don't know whether or not you said something completely contrary to that just a month ago. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6735.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think that might be part of why Kamala was so worried about the unedited thing. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6739.82s)]
*  You know, when Hillary fainted a few election cycles ago, that video would have never made the news in the 90s. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6744.82s)]
*  They just got bought. Right. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6751.82s)]
*  But fucking before they nobody knew it existed before it was posted. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6753.82s)]
*  It was just like the dude and bam. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6757.82s)]
*  And now the Internet has it as too fucking late. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6759.82s)]
*  So I think the real thing that did her in was call me. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6761.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I think the investigation into the emails, I think that like in the middle of the that was brutal. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6764.82s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6771.82s)]
*  But what I'm getting at is that I think that that's especially for an older politician, somebody like Biden. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6772.82s)]
*  How many decades of his life was he able to buy any video footage that was going to cause him any problems? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6779.82s)]
*  He just fucking squashed that two or three. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6786.82s)]
*  Two or three. And now it's like nothing. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6789.82s)]
*  You slip and fall. Going viral, buddy. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6792.82s)]
*  And you know, you could do about it. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6795.82s)]
*  Also, who's letting him walk up that fucking stair without having a catcher behind? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6796.82s)]
*  Oh, come on. I would have some giant dudes, big old fucking linemen. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6799.82s)]
*  Because if he's going down the stairs and you got slippery shoes on, that's a fucking precarious catch. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6807.82s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, you got a 180 pound man who stumbles and he falls backwards like, yeah, that's the fucking president. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6811.82s)]
*  Don't just let him walk up that thing on his own with slippery shoes on after he fell the third time. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6818.82s)]
*  Why did they let him keep doing that? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6823.82s)]
*  I think maybe it was some of Gerald Ford's family was hoping he'd break the record. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6825.82s)]
*  People don't know. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6829.82s)]
*  Given away our age here. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6831.82s)]
*  The old Gerald Ford stuff. Boy, that's old. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6832.82s)]
*  Next you got to do a Nixon impression. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6835.82s)]
*  Oh, God. Yeah, I'm not a crook. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6837.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's all the whole thing was very eye opening, I think. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6840.82s)]
*  And I think that also led to Trump, you know, destroying in the election. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6846.82s)]
*  That's that's probably has a lot to do with it. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6851.82s)]
*  I mentioned before, like they closed that white elephant store, but like they closed so many bars in the town. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6853.82s)]
*  Like I was thrilled that my favorite bar Mootsies is still around. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6859.82s)]
*  But I had a close sign on it when apparently like the plumbing above it leaked. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6864.82s)]
*  And I thought they were gone, too, because it was closed down for them to fix that in the middle of covid. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6869.82s)]
*  And it was just like, God damn it. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6873.82s)]
*  It's like we lost so many things in that town that were just little mom and pop outfits and just comes in and gets replaced with like Target. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6874.82s)]
*  Yeah. And like you come to a city like this and you still got little shops that do well, little cafes and whatnot. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6883.82s)]
*  But I live out in this. I live in a city, but around it's a bunch of farm farm country. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6891.82s)]
*  And there's like the place in Davenport that had these great milkshakes. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6896.82s)]
*  You can't fucking go there no more. They're closed. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6899.82s)]
*  They're gone. And it's a bunch of places like they've been around for generations. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6901.82s)]
*  And it didn't have to happen that way. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6905.82s)]
*  And if you want to be real cynical, the people that are the real progressive leftists that you should be cynical about that because it was the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the United States. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6907.82s)]
*  The lower class, lower middle class lost three point nine billion dollars or trillion. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6918.82s)]
*  Was it trillion was a transfer? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6924.82s)]
*  It might have been trillion. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6927.82s)]
*  I think it was like three point nine trillion dollars over the over the course of the pandemic. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6928.82s)]
*  And then that money was transferred to the the wealthiest people gained that money. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6932.82s)]
*  How what happened? Stocks, mutual funds. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6938.82s)]
*  What what what what what what magic are you doing? [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6942.82s)]
*  You basically stole money like something happened. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6945.82s)]
*  And through your policies, you enabled the wealthiest people to get way wealthier and the poorer people to get way poorer. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6947.82s)]
*  It's like three point nine trillion. Is that correct? [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6954.82s)]
*  The transfer of wealth. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6958.82s)]
*  I'm looking at an article from twenty twenty two. I didn't see anything new. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6960.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's a newer one. They were talking about it really recently. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6962.82s)]
*  They were talking about it like mirrors exactly. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6966.82s)]
*  One trillion something in there. Two trillion. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6969.82s)]
*  I see. What year is that? [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6972.82s)]
*  Two trillion. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6974.82s)]
*  I don't know. I think they expect to pass. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6976.82s)]
*  So either way, let's just let's be conservative and say it's three trillion. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6978.82s)]
*  That's a crazy amount of money that gets transferred and no one is like freaked out that this was by policies. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6982.82s)]
*  And this is by keeping everybody's business shut down. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6988.82s)]
*  You could basically just take over because people still need to buy stuff. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6990.82s)]
*  And then these big companies that people have stock in, the stock goes way up and then everybody gets wealthier. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6993.82s)]
*  This is kind of nuts. Well, the progressives are outraged that this idea that it was protecting your health. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=6999.82s)]
*  But how are you sure? Did you look at the data? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7005.82s)]
*  Because it doesn't seem like it was over several decades. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7008.82s)]
*  This says it was 50 trillion during the pandemic, though. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7010.82s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7014.82s)]
*  50 trillion from the bottom. 90 percent. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7016.82s)]
*  And that's made the U.S. less secure. Yeah, for fucking for sure it does. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7018.82s)]
*  But the problem is, yachts aren't cheap, bro. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7021.82s)]
*  No, they're not. I'm not looking at them yet, but maybe next week. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7024.82s)]
*  You want to put it in order for one of them supersonic jets? [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7028.82s)]
*  You got to have some chatter. It might be time to take over a small country. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7030.82s)]
*  Or two, yeah. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7033.82s)]
*  Or two, yeah. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7035.82s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7036.82s)]
*  The things that were lost during covid were in my mind. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7038.82s)]
*  One of the biggest things was the trust in the scientific community that they're being honest. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7043.82s)]
*  And I again, I like science. I like science a lot. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7051.82s)]
*  And I don't I think that just like most activists and most anything like when you look online [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7054.82s)]
*  and you see a transgender person is making a complete ass of themselves, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7059.82s)]
*  that's generally speaking not indicative of the way transgender people are, [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7063.82s)]
*  even on the fucking Internet, man. Otherwise, you wouldn't be seeing that person. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7067.82s)]
*  Right. Right. But everything with everything with cops, with teachers, with some crazy teachers [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7070.82s)]
*  saying nutty things in front of the class. That's a small percentage, a tiny. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7076.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's a problem. It's a problem. But it's not all teachers. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7080.82s)]
*  No. But when when it's science, the deal is, is that science fact checks itself. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7082.82s)]
*  Like these guys all throw rocks at each other. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7089.82s)]
*  They write a paper and other guys are trying to rip it apart and prove them wrong. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7091.82s)]
*  And OK, so in that environment, it requires an acceptance for this kind of shit to fly for it, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7094.82s)]
*  for them to be able to repeatedly lie in peer review journals requires their peers to not review the fucking papers. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7103.82s)]
*  That's really the only only way that can happen. And that happens so much. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7110.82s)]
*  Like it's it's still the medical first thing, the Clovis first thing, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7114.82s)]
*  which was another thing that Flint pushed back against. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7118.82s)]
*  And but obviously there's a lot of receipts like that guy almost lost his career, was shunned by science. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7122.82s)]
*  And he was right. And our mainstream archaeologists tore that guy apart with personal attacks. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7130.82s)]
*  They tried to destroy his reputation, destroy his career because they didn't want to be proven wrong. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7135.82s)]
*  They tried. Tom Dillehay was the guy who explained the whole thing to people. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7140.82s)]
*  OK, absolutely. Clovis first is the theory that the first people in the Americas came over the Bering land bridge like 14, 15000 years ago. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7145.82s)]
*  And they were used to Clovis points. And this was the first American humans. Before that, there was no people here. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7155.82s)]
*  Now they started finding sites 30,000 years old, 25,000 years old. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7160.82s)]
*  And it started fucking with that narrative. And archaeologists were for the most part pushing heavily against it. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7164.82s)]
*  There were a few scientists that would make the finds and that they would fight for them. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7170.82s)]
*  The one eventually it's been overturned. Now that Clovis first is not the narrative anymore. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7175.82s)]
*  They're not really sure exactly who got here first. They know the Bering land bridge was part of it, [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7180.82s)]
*  but they also think there was some people from probably from the ocean in South America. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7183.82s)]
*  And who knows for sure. It's up in the air. They're not so certain anymore. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7187.82s)]
*  But the Clovis first debate, it was so bad that the guy that won it basically a site in Chile called Monte Verde was the site that eventually he had a bunch of people there. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7191.82s)]
*  They looked at the site and when they left, they were convinced that that was the end of the debate for all intents and purposes. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7205.82s)]
*  There's still a few holdout. How old was Monte Verde? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7212.82s)]
*  Estimated 30,000 years, I think. Twenty seven thousand like right in there. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7214.82s)]
*  The guy that discovered that site and was excavating it, Tom Dillehay, was living in Chile under the time that Pinochet was in charge of Chile. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7220.82s)]
*  One of his colleagues, there's video of this. I use this clip frequently. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7229.82s)]
*  One of his colleagues called the state newspaper and said Monte Verde is a CIA planted site in order to get him down into Chile. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7233.82s)]
*  His wife and kids are there. They fucking threatened his life over. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7244.82s)]
*  This is the archaeologist version of swatting. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7248.82s)]
*  Yeah, I should. You know, the videos all over. I use this clip frequently. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7251.82s)]
*  He basically threatened his life straight up. He had letters to people saying that he wasn't a real scientist. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7255.82s)]
*  Is this Dillehay explaining this? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7263.82s)]
*  Yeah, Tom Dillehay explaining this. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7265.82s)]
*  If Jamie could find it, what would the video be? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7267.82s)]
*  If you have to go on Google, Tom Dillehay interview will probably do it. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7269.82s)]
*  D-I-L-L-E-H-A-Y. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7275.82s)]
*  Sorry, I should have had that one pegged. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7279.82s)]
*  No worries. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7281.82s)]
*  I use this clip. I probably use it ten times. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7282.82s)]
*  It's not one of those. Maybe put archaeology with it. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7285.82s)]
*  Because he's talking to another archaeologist. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7293.82s)]
*  Dang it. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7298.82s)]
*  Challenging Clovis First. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7302.82s)]
*  Here. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7304.82s)]
*  Oh, well. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7305.82s)]
*  Archaeologists threaten one of their own over Clovis First? Is that it? [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7306.82s)]
*  No, it's only... There's me. That one actually has a clip. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7311.82s)]
*  Okay, play that then. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7316.82s)]
*  Archaeologist Tom Dillehay was instrumental in overturning Clovis First with his excavations at Monte Verde. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7317.82s)]
*  But this caused him to have his life threatened by his own colleagues. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7323.82s)]
*  His excavations were done in Chile during the reign of the ruthless dictator Pinochet. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7327.82s)]
*  Clovis First was hotly debated amongst archaeologists at the time, [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7331.82s)]
*  and one of them decided to use Pinochet as a means to silence Tom. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7334.82s)]
*  Moved down to Chile during the dictatorship years of Pinochet. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7338.82s)]
*  So I was opening up anthropology departments. So politically it was difficult at that time. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7343.82s)]
*  And another colleague who sent a letter to the newspaper in Chile, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7348.82s)]
*  one of the major newspapers saying that Monte Verde was creation of the CIA to plant me down there. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7353.82s)]
*  And you know, that puts you and your family in a dangerous situation in a country like that at that time. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7359.82s)]
*  Seems to me like the archaeologist version of swatting someone. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7365.82s)]
*  There's a small minority of people who will do anything in their power to defend their paradigm. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7368.82s)]
*  Yeah. That's it. That's fucking wild. That's crazy. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7377.82s)]
*  What if that guy got murdered? Would they be happy? [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7381.82s)]
*  Would they take him and publicly executed him because they said he was a CIA spy? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7383.82s)]
*  I'd like to say no, but I mean. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7388.82s)]
*  Would they be happy? That's such a psychotic thing to do to someone just because. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7390.82s)]
*  But you know, these people, like everything that they identify as is the expert in this particular field. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7394.82s)]
*  And they'll try to pretend, Flint tried to pretend that that was no big deal. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7403.82s)]
*  That was a one-off. You know, scientific debates happen. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7406.82s)]
*  And a lot of guys will say, oh, yeah, that that clover's first. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7408.82s)]
*  It was bad, but we don't usually do that. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7411.82s)]
*  Before Clovis first, there was the Folsom first debate, the idea that the Folsom people were the first ones here. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7413.82s)]
*  And if you found anything older than I think seven thousand years or three thousand years, whatever it was, anything older than a Folsom culture thing, it was bullshit. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7420.82s)]
*  And you couldn't have a feel. You could. It's on Wikipedia still. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7428.82s)]
*  You could read about there's a couple of guys that basically formed a guard and didn't let anything get past that point until. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7431.82s)]
*  Eventually, the Clovis first thing is it's not the first time this is standard operating procedure created paradigm, defendant with life and death. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7437.82s)]
*  There's a guy named Max Planck. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7446.82s)]
*  He was a Nobel Prize winning physicist and he has Planck's principle. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7450.82s)]
*  It's known as and it is science does not progress one discovery at a time. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7454.82s)]
*  It progresses one funeral at a time. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7460.82s)]
*  And this is a Nobel Prize winning physicist that said that, not Graham Hancock. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7464.82s)]
*  So it's fucking pretty hefty to think about that. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7468.82s)]
*  That's just people are people, man. Yeah. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7471.82s)]
*  Put us on the moon. You're going to have people on the moon. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7474.82s)]
*  Same fucking problems. People on Mars. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7476.82s)]
*  Someone's going to make a sex cult on Mars. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7479.82s)]
*  It'll be great. People will be like, look, I'm the fucking king of Mars, bitch. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7482.82s)]
*  I'm running. It's just humans. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7486.82s)]
*  And unfortunately, even humans that are attached to what we think of as these egoless pursuits like science. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7489.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's the ego fucks up even science. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7498.82s)]
*  But that's where that's where it does frustrate me, because if you take that job, it's like, OK, anytime if me and you get in a fight, it's going to be, you know, it's aggressive and you like you get worked up and you get emotional. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7501.82s)]
*  But if you become a cop, I expect you to fucking know that and roll that shit back. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7514.82s)]
*  Right. I expected. And it's the same thing with the scientists. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7519.82s)]
*  I expect you to recognize that and roll that shit back. Yeah. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7522.82s)]
*  Roll that shit back. That's your job. That's your job. Tell us what the truth is. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7525.82s)]
*  And if you lie, it doesn't mean that all that truth that you told in the past is now accurate. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7529.82s)]
*  It just means you suck. That's all it means. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7535.82s)]
*  So if you're a really good scientist, you say this is what we thought. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7537.82s)]
*  This is what we know now. And this is really amazing. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7541.82s)]
*  And so I was wrong. All these books that I wrote. Stop buying them, folks. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7544.82s)]
*  I'm going to have to write a new book. They don't ever want to say that. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7548.82s)]
*  They never want to think that those lectures that they taught that those were inaccurate and that their whole life, they they would be a mockery. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7550.82s)]
*  They really would, because those scientists are fucking vicious. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7558.82s)]
*  They're so vicious after each other. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7561.82s)]
*  They attack each other because they all want to be the fucking smartest guy in the room. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7563.82s)]
*  And when anybody else Mike, Mike's a fucking moron. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7567.82s)]
*  Mike thinks that you heard him talk about Fauci, the way Kerry Moll is talked about. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7571.82s)]
*  That's how they talk about each other. That's exactly. He's he doesn't know anything. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7574.82s)]
*  I'd say it right to his face. It's just natural human aggression that's transferred into this field that we think of as purely academic. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7577.82s)]
*  And quite frequently, these people are like I said earlier, a little emotionally off, a little socially. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7586.82s)]
*  A little socially bullied, bullied their whole life. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7590.82s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden they get to be the bully, which is one of the things that does happen. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7593.82s)]
*  It's the revenge of the nerds. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7596.82s)]
*  Really, you're right. That's what revenge of the nerds is. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7598.82s)]
*  It is like finally we get our turn to be mean. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7601.82s)]
*  Didn't we not learn anything? This is how wars get started. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7605.82s)]
*  People this is how people wind up killing people because you other the other. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7608.82s)]
*  By the way, when I drew the parallel about us fighting, I don't want a picture of me next to Shane Gillis. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7611.82s)]
*  Thank you very much. I'm good. Don't need that. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7616.82s)]
*  The whole idea of the truth is what we all should be pursuing. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7620.82s)]
*  And it's just really unfortunate that people are attached to these things that they've said for so long, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7626.82s)]
*  so much that they're willing to go out of their way to prove someone inaccurate when they are accurate. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7631.82s)]
*  And the Clovis first thing is one of the better examples of that. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7638.82s)]
*  And now that there's irrefutable evidence like the footprints that they found in New Mexico that have seeds in them that are 22 plus thousand years old. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7641.82s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. OK. It's out the window now. We don't you don't know. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7650.82s)]
*  How about now? We don't know. We don't know how people got here. We don't know how long they've been here. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7654.82s)]
*  Quit trying to find a clear answer and like keep investigating. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7658.82s)]
*  Right. Especially when we know South America had life, had all these humans living in South America. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7662.82s)]
*  Why wouldn't they move up to North America? Like, why would that be weird? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7669.82s)]
*  Like, what's the oldest known people in South America? What's the oldest? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7673.82s)]
*  I'm not to be honest with you. I'm not sure. The whole Amazon thing's got to throw that big old monkey wrench into that. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7677.82s)]
*  Well, they recently you know who Thor Haired all was the guy that did like the Contiki voyage to prove that you could cross the ocean in a raft and all that shit. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7682.82s)]
*  OK. Yeah. He's an archaeologist. And now he pointed out that on Easter Island that the platform that the biggest oldest whatever Moai or whatever they're called that platform, the polygonal masonry strongly resembled what he saw in Peru to the point where he hypothesized that these were connected. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7690.82s)]
*  And this was just mocked by archaeologists for a longest time. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7710.82s)]
*  Now, not only do they have genetic evidence in the form of human DNA with a solid genetic drift from South America heading out into Polynesia as well, but Easter Island has breadfruit, has ginger and a couple of sweet potato. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7713.82s)]
*  It's got food from both Asia and South America and the oldest habited layers that they found. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7731.82s)]
*  So like they've very old and that's scientifically. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7737.82s)]
*  What is the oldest habit of layers? [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7740.82s)]
*  It's like I want to say like twelve hundred or eighteen hundred years ago. It's not real, real old, but it's old enough that like the oldest place that they've excavated and found that the first people looks like the first people that showed up there came there from Asia and South America already. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7741.82s)]
*  They've been connected to both. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7757.82s)]
*  What was the evidence of cocaine and mummies? Was that bullshit? [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7758.82s)]
*  I'm not sure about that. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7762.82s)]
*  I've it's one of the things that every time I look into it, the data is kind of threadbare. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7763.82s)]
*  And as a skeptical guy and a guy who's had his share of time in bars and bathrooms, did you ever have a strong, much stronger feeling that there was some anthropologist in the 70s was just doing a fucking bump? [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7769.82s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7782.82s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7783.82s)]
*  Way smoking a cigarette and doing a bump on sarcophagus is way more likely than that just to me. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7784.82s)]
*  But I could be wrong. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7790.82s)]
*  Yeah. And if you're doing coke, you might put a little coke on the mummy. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7792.82s)]
*  I'm going to do a coke off this fucking money. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7794.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7796.82s)]
*  I'll just come. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7797.82s)]
*  So you're smoking your minds and you're doing archaeology and it's the 70s. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7798.82s)]
*  Oh, no one. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7802.82s)]
*  No one is like looking over your shoulder. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7803.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7805.82s)]
*  You're a wild fucking Indiana Jones type coke head. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7806.82s)]
*  Fuck, there's already people with the AI fucking artwork out trying to make sure what was the evidence? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7810.82s)]
*  See if you can find what the evidence for cocaine in Egyptian mummies was. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7818.82s)]
*  The Russian scientists that said he found some in 1992, 90s. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7824.82s)]
*  Look, I found coke. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7828.82s)]
*  He's like he's doing blow. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7830.82s)]
*  He's doing blow. They bust him. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7834.82s)]
*  I found cocaine. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7836.82s)]
*  It was in the mummy. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7837.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7838.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7839.82s)]
*  Definitely not my cocaine. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7840.82s)]
*  Cocaine hashish and nicotine in the hair of Henut Tau. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7842.82s)]
*  Taui. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7847.82s)]
*  Well, cocaine has nicotine. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7848.82s)]
*  OK. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7852.82s)]
*  German toxicologist Svetlana Balabanova discovered traces of cocaine hashish and nicotine on Henut Taui. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7853.82s)]
*  How do you say that? [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7862.82s)]
*  Henut twice. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7863.82s)]
*  How do you say his name? [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7864.82s)]
*  Henut Taui. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7865.82s)]
*  Taui. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7866.82s)]
*  Henut Taui's hair. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7867.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7868.82s)]
*  As well as on the hair of several other mummies of the museum, which is significant and the only source for cocaine and nicotine had at that time been considered to be the cocoa and tobacco plants native to the Americas. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7869.82s)]
*  They were not thought to have been present in Africa until after Columbus' voyage to the Americas. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7880.82s)]
*  The result was interpreted by theorists and supporters of contacts between pre-Columbian people and ancient Egyptians as a proof for their claims. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7885.82s)]
*  The findings are controversial because while other researchers have also detected the presence of cocaine and nicotine in Egyptian mummies, two successive analysis of the other groups of Egyptian mummies and human remains failed to fully reproduce Balabanova's results and some showing positive results only for nicotine. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7894.82s)]
*  But even that is interesting, right? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7912.82s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7914.82s)]
*  And then the next slide actually basically says what I just did. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7915.82s)]
*  After these experiments, even assuming that cocaine was actually found on the mummies, it is possible that this could be contamination. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7918.82s)]
*  Yeah, it says that. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7923.82s)]
*  It says even assuming that cocaine was actually found in the mummies could be contamination, which occurred after discovery of the mummies. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7924.82s)]
*  The same argument could be applied to nicotine. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7933.82s)]
*  But in addition, various plants other than tobacco are a source of nicotine. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7935.82s)]
*  And two of these, withhenia somnifera and apium gravillens. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7940.82s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7950.82s)]
*  Known to be used by the ancient Egyptians. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7952.82s)]
*  OK, so they did have some sort of nicotine plant. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7954.82s)]
*  That was in 92, 2007 researchers in Peru may have also found some. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7958.82s)]
*  Oh, and Incan mummies. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7962.82s)]
*  But Incan mummies are that's that's there. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7964.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's where cocaine is. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7967.82s)]
*  If it was actual cocaine, that would be crazy if it was like if it was not just coca plant, but like a little baggie for the future for your travels. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7969.82s)]
*  Come aliens, please come back. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7979.82s)]
*  A little vile. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7981.82s)]
*  A little vile. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7982.82s)]
*  They tucked away with him in his grave. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7983.82s)]
*  We've done everything we could to get them aliens back. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7985.82s)]
*  We're going to process some of that shit. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7987.82s)]
*  Come on, boys. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7988.82s)]
*  It would be fascinating if we actually could prove that somehow and other people from South America had made their way to Egypt and back and forth. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7989.82s)]
*  And another interesting argument for that was always the Olmecs. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=7997.82s)]
*  Like what they look Polynesian or African. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8000.82s)]
*  They don't necessarily look like they're from South America. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8004.82s)]
*  Yeah. And there's a there's a lot of the arguments that were made by those guys I brought up earlier that were back in the 1860s. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8007.82s)]
*  They were one of them was big into linguists and linguistics. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8015.82s)]
*  And he made all these language models and stuff as to why that Maya was the first or proto language that was all these other ones were built on. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8019.82s)]
*  The other dude was really into iconography. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8028.82s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen some of the symbols that like you see around the world like the that girl that's sitting on the lions and the master of beast symbols. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8030.82s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8038.82s)]
*  Things like that. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8039.82s)]
*  You know, it's it's not these are. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8040.82s)]
*  Did you want me to pull that up? [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8043.82s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Yeah. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8044.82s)]
*  Look up a master of beasts. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8045.82s)]
*  Like, I guess. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8047.82s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8049.82s)]
*  You're going to find some cartoon. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8050.82s)]
*  That says that they did more testing that says that there might have been cocaine in up to eight bodies. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8053.82s)]
*  Well, it did multiple testing. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8059.82s)]
*  Yeah. If you're living in Egypt, you're going to get some coke if you've got that kind of cheddar. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8061.82s)]
*  You know, I mean, if you got like gold headdresses and what's the ultimate thing to have coke? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8065.82s)]
*  You know, clearly, clearly you're trying to get more women's. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8069.82s)]
*  You got some guy who's coming over from South America. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8072.82s)]
*  In the wake of controversy, these radio immune, nasty gas chromatography and master spectrometry and all of those got the same results. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8076.82s)]
*  All bone soft tissue and hair contain traces of the drug ruling out possibility of external. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8087.82s)]
*  Oh, OK. So they did have cocaine. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8091.82s)]
*  OK. There you go. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8093.82s)]
*  Now you got some weird shit. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8095.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8097.82s)]
*  I look into this. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8098.82s)]
*  Let's just slam the book and say it's accurate. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8099.82s)]
*  If you look up like like ancient symbol or hopefully that'll bring it up. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8101.82s)]
*  I forget. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8106.82s)]
*  He man, master of universe. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8107.82s)]
*  I have the power. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8111.82s)]
*  God damn, we're getting old today with the references. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8113.82s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8115.82s)]
*  Yeah, we are. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8116.82s)]
*  So Ford and he man. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8117.82s)]
*  That's it. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8119.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8120.82s)]
*  So that exists all over the world. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8121.82s)]
*  That's that type of iconography of usually the most famous. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8123.82s)]
*  All the way back into like Kara Hayek Turkey, like one of those gopecle type a type of sites has has this symbol and that type of symbol. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8127.82s)]
*  You look at that master of animals one, the Wikipedia one in the middle, the gray one. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8137.82s)]
*  Yeah, right there where your cursor just was, Jamie. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8141.82s)]
*  No, the one where your cursor was. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8143.82s)]
*  Sorry. Above that. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8145.82s)]

*  I know. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8162.82s)]
*  It is crazy. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8163.82s)]
*  Because it looks like it's got two monsters next to her. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8164.82s)]
*  That image that we were just looking on. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8167.82s)]

*  What the fuck is that? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8174.82s)]
*  What are those things next to her? [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8176.82s)]
*  They look like some kind of lion lizard hybrid. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8178.82s)]
*  But look, they have lizard tongues. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8182.82s)]
*  Snake? [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8184.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough to say. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8185.82s)]

*  They have wings. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8189.82s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8190.82s)]
*  And why does that exist all over the world? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8191.82s)]
*  That's really where it's an interesting thing that when you see that kind of iconography, [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8194.82s)]
*  it's not the argument of, well, a nail looks like a nail anywhere because you invented a nail. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8200.82s)]
*  That falls apart because this is just symbols, right? [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8205.82s)]
*  This is just symbolism. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8209.82s)]
*  So that would imply some contact, right? [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8211.82s)]
*  And it shows up way long ago. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8214.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8216.82s)]
*  And why? [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8217.82s)]
*  How is that getting all around the world? [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8218.82s)]
*  Clearly, people are bringing it. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8221.82s)]
*  Now, see, there's one place just because I don't necessarily ascribe to lost technology [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8222.82s)]
*  or ancient high technology. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8227.82s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8230.82s)]
*  When it comes to lost civilization, I'm very much of the opinion that there was a civilization [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8231.82s)]
*  from before 12,000 years ago that got wiped out by some sort of cataclysm. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8237.82s)]
*  I don't think that it was. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8242.82s)]
*  I don't think that they had like real high technology, but it wouldn't have taken much [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8243.82s)]
*  technology for them to appear better than their contemporaries. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8248.82s)]
*  And we see evidence for that today, too, which is a really good point. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8252.82s)]
*  People say, how is it possible that the rest of the world could have been so far behind? [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8255.82s)]
*  Well, they were. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8259.82s)]
*  OK, first of all, with the Egyptians, they definitely were. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8260.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8263.82s)]
*  Definitely. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8264.82s)]
*  But proven everybody else is way far behind them. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8265.82s)]
*  But even today, my friend Paul Rosalie, he lives in the Amazon. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8267.82s)]
*  He's like he protects rainforest and hires these people that used to be loggers to now [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8271.82s)]
*  protect the rainforest. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8275.82s)]
*  And amazing guy. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8277.82s)]
*  He just filmed the other day an uncontacted tribe. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8278.82s)]
*  Just the other day. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8282.82s)]
*  There's uncontacted tribes all throughout there. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8283.82s)]
*  They're completely naked and they're living as an assistance lifestyle in the Amazon forest. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8285.82s)]
*  Who knows what their fucking language is? [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8291.82s)]
*  Who knows what their culture is about? [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8293.82s)]
*  But this is a completely uncontacted tribe that exists today, along with us with AI on our smartphones. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8294.82s)]
*  Same time period. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8302.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8303.82s)]
*  So the idea that this couldn't exist at other parts of the world in the past. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8304.82s)]
*  No, it fucking for sure could. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8308.82s)]
*  By the way, it fucking did in the 1800s when settlers were making their way across the United States. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8310.82s)]
*  Dude, the sun never sets on the British Empire was because Europe was [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8316.82s)]
*  hop skipping a jump ahead of the rest of the world when it came to sailing and conquering people. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8321.82s)]
*  And that's I mean, are you about whether that's good or bad or whatever. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8327.82s)]
*  But it just existed. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8331.82s)]
*  It existed. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8333.82s)]
*  We're talking about the abilities. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8334.82s)]
*  It's they were they were better at it. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8335.82s)]
*  And in the United States is the best example. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8337.82s)]
*  And in what what was going on when settlers came from Europe and making their way across the country, they were encountering Stone Age tribes. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8339.82s)]
*  Yeah, effectively. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8346.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8347.82s)]
*  A hundred percent Stone Age. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8348.82s)]
*  They were using stone tools. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8349.82s)]
*  They were using Flint arrowheads. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8350.82s)]
*  There was a couple of people that had copper, but they weren't being they weren't making weapons by a large from it. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8351.82s)]
*  Right. They were making like jewelry and stuff. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8357.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty crazy. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8359.82s)]
*  It's pretty crazy, but it's just a natural function of how human beings adapt to their environment. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8361.82s)]
*  And it seems that the Nile Valley in Egypt was an abundant, rich environment that had so much resources that allow those people to stay there and thrive for thousands of years. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8366.82s)]
*  And if you think of the area being a green Sahara and then it slowly gets smaller, that Nile Delta would explain that concentration of people and ideas and stuff, because you've got what would once spread out across a large area being all shoved together. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8378.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8392.82s)]
*  Making almost a proto city type of thing or whatever. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8393.82s)]
*  Yeah, I'm of the opinion that whatever the lost civilization was, I'm of the opinion that they were really good at seafaring, which made that they were really good at astronomy. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8396.82s)]
*  And I put to myself, I think that like the handbag symbol, I think that that's a symbol of their ability to I think like that it is a symbol for a day like we were talking about before on that pillar. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8405.82s)]
*  Go back Lee teppi that there's three of those handbags and he says each one is it's actually a sunrise. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8418.82s)]
*  It's a why why is the handbag sunrise. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8423.82s)]
*  It's a it's a the ground. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8425.82s)]
*  And it's a son. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8428.82s)]
*  It's not an actual handbag. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8429.82s)]
*  It's a it's a ground and could you look up go back Lee teppi pillar 43. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8431.82s)]
*  Sorry, Jamie. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8436.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8437.82s)]
*  In that case, it looks less like a handbag because there's nobody holding it. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8441.82s)]
*  But in this case, Dr. Martin sweat man's on the work and looks like it's three different days he has it symbolized as so going with that. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8445.82s)]
*  You see that three handbags there, each one with an animal next to it. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8455.82s)]
*  He believes that that's denoting the so not a handbag but the Ark of the Sun over the earth. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8459.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8464.82s)]
*  So when somebody is holding one of those, I think that it's a symbol for a knowledge of astro of astronomy that most people don't have. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8465.82s)]
*  So the astronomers are the people holding the handbag. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8472.82s)]
*  That's what I want to explain to you the cycles of time. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8476.82s)]
*  And they're the ones that were capable of seafarers. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8479.82s)]
*  There were the ones that when they would show up, they would have the same teamwork, the same ability to work with ropes and all that shit they could use to move Megalith the same mathematics or extension of it. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8483.82s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that would would be easier for them to move a big rock with a team of guys that have worked together working on boats than it would be for them to move a big rock with a team of people who never done anything like that before. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8496.82s)]
*  And that would also explain why a lot of times these are lined up with stars and shit like that because astronomy we very important to them. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8508.82s)]
*  So that's I do think that there was a lot of civilization. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8514.82s)]
*  I mean, even simple shit like the bow and arrow in all honesty, if you think about how complicated that would be to effectively create all the way it's like it's easy for a dude to figure out the tension but building a flight and an arrow that's like weighted. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8517.82s)]
*  It's way different than a spear. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8530.82s)]
*  It's being launched from the back, not the center. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8531.82s)]
*  And just transfer it over. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8533.82s)]
*  This is requiring multiple people over multiple generations in my opinion I think that the fact that we see it all over the fucking planet. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8535.82s)]
*  It says something that probably people are traveling. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8542.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's not something that people would figure out on their own everywhere. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8545.82s)]
*  We have a lot of models to write. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8549.82s)]
*  Yeah, and people figured those ones out so that seems like a more simple simpler. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8551.82s)]
*  Why isn't that everywhere instead of bow and arrow probably was but the bow and arrow supplanted it and it was only kept where you really needed the penetrating power of the atlatl. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8556.82s)]
*  Right. So that's again this is all just spitballing but we don't know for sure I could say that I do but I don't. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8564.82s)]
*  So it's so interesting. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8571.82s)]
*  Really so interesting because the concept of if these mummies that show cocaine really are proof that somehow or another someone came from the Americas with cocaine and made their way to Egypt. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8573.82s)]
*  Boy that throws the whole thing throws a monkey wrench into the whole gears of our timeline of civilization. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8583.82s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8590.82s)]
*  How are they doing that? [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8591.82s)]
*  How did they get over there? [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8592.82s)]
*  That's so fucking far. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8593.82s)]
*  And a knocky taxi cab service. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8595.82s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8598.82s)]
*  Oh, this is based off of what you're saying with like it's a time measuring tool. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8599.82s)]
*  I'm looking for more examples of it. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8603.82s)]
*  This is a very interesting explanation. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8605.82s)]
*  I don't know if it's accurate. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8608.82s)]
*  Hopefully you can shed some light on it. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8610.82s)]
*  Does this make any sense what it's saying about a water clock. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8612.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8616.82s)]
*  Baboon because there's a damn it. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8617.82s)]
*  I can pull it up in a second. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8620.82s)]
*  No it's okay. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8621.82s)]
*  Let's just read this. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8622.82s)]
*  It looks like a basket. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8623.82s)]
*  And what is this from? [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8624.82s)]
*  What is this? [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8625.82s)]
*  I'll post about Reddit. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8626.82s)]
*  So I'm explaining what this is. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8627.82s)]
*  The hieroglyph depicts one form of something called a water clock or say that word. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8629.82s)]
*  Klebsydra. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8634.82s)]
*  Klebsydra hydrologia which was used to tell the time by the drainage of water through a small hole. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8635.82s)]
*  The item associated with Thoth due to its use as a measuring tool and thus miniature versions or models made of how's that? [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8644.82s)]
*  What's that word? [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8652.82s)]
*  Fiance? [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8653.82s)]
*  What's that word? [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8654.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8655.82s)]
*  Fiance. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8656.82s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8657.82s)]
*  Often had baboons incorporated into their structure. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8658.82s)]
*  It said that Horopolo in hieroglyphica that it was traditional to allow water to drain out of a hole in the baboon's genitalia because the baboon apparently cries and urinates 12 times a day on the equinoxes. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8660.82s)]
*  So you just like force feed water into a baboon to figure out what time it is? [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8676.82s)]
*  Take a nice class. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8681.82s)]
*  He's just howling. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8684.82s)]
*  Oh, it's time to go to eat. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8685.82s)]
*  Monkey's howling. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8687.82s)]
*  Regardless of the exact reason, the hole was indeed sometimes placed at the end of the baboon's penis. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8688.82s)]
*  Model non-functional versions of the water clock often mimic the shape of the hieroglyph itself similar to the maat figurine and may have been used in offering rituals. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8695.82s)]
*  See if you can find one of those figurines. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8705.82s)]
*  So that's a water clock built on the idea and the water clock, the water comes out of the baboon's penis. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8707.82s)]
*  And I know that the ancient Egyptians like would measure time during the evening hours with water clocks like that. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8715.82s)]
*  They would have people tasked with keeping time for the area. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8723.82s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8727.82s)]
*  It's a baboon water clock. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8728.82s)]
*  The water comes, it drips out of his dick. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8730.82s)]
*  And when all the water, so it's like a sort of like an hourglass. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8731.82s)]
*  Yeah, but it's the baboon's dick. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8735.82s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8736.82s)]
*  That is that's impressive. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8738.82s)]
*  I found out something new today. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8740.82s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8742.82s)]
*  That makes it worth it. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8743.82s)]
*  Below that pillar there. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8744.82s)]
*  I think someone else has explained to us that those are like they think that's the time like calendar. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8745.82s)]
*  Those are days or months or something like that. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8749.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8751.82s)]
*  All this is time. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8752.82s)]
*  Yes, that's why. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8753.82s)]
*  So he what Dr. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8754.82s)]
*  Martin Sweatman thinks is those three handbags there are three of the cardinal points like two equinoxes and one solstice, I think. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8755.82s)]
*  And then the condor down there holding the sun is what he believes. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8764.82s)]
*  He believes that's Sagittarius and that it's basically denoting that the fourth cardinal point of the year and that all those other marks add up to the squares are a month. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8769.82s)]
*  The V's are days. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8783.82s)]
*  And at the end of a according to his interpretation, it's where he thinks that it's a recording of the time that the asteroid hit the younger dryus impact. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8785.82s)]
*  And his he's wrote two scientific papers on it. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8794.82s)]
*  He's come under a lot of fire for it. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8798.82s)]
*  But the shocker, the majority of the fire is really funny. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8800.82s)]
*  It's like, OK, he's he's a chemical engineer. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8803.82s)]
*  So he's a mathematician by trade. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8808.82s)]
*  He's a number cruncher. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8809.82s)]
*  And so the first thing everybody says, ah, he's not an archaeology. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8811.82s)]
*  You got a fucking number cruncher in here. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8815.82s)]
*  It's like the field of archaeo astronomy, as it's called, was first officially recognized because of the work of a guy named Alexander Tom. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8817.82s)]
*  He's the one that was like plotting out a bunch of shit in England and whatnot. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8826.82s)]
*  Right. And seeing that this lines up with that, it looks like this the ancients would stand here to look there. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8829.82s)]
*  He predicted that they would find a viewing platform. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8836.82s)]
*  It was a certain site. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8839.82s)]
*  He's like they stood up on the side of that hill. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8840.82s)]
*  I'll bet you find a platform there. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8842.82s)]
*  They found that platform. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8843.82s)]
*  And now it was he's starting to do some science here. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8844.82s)]
*  He's making predictions and they're coming true. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8846.82s)]
*  This guy was an engineer, not a chemical engineer. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8849.82s)]
*  He's a construction engineer, but he had fuck all to do with archaeology. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8852.82s)]
*  This is very common. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8856.82s)]
*  If you look at the teams that make up archaeo astronomy expeditions, it's usually an astronomer, an archaeologist and then somebody who's just a math whiz. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8857.82s)]
*  He's really, really he's way above the pay grade on either one of these guys when it comes to number crunching. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8867.82s)]
*  That's generally speaking, the teams that make these things up. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8872.82s)]
*  So when they go beating at this guy, right, that betrays, they don't even know what this fucking field. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8874.82s)]
*  And it's of course, these are all scientists and historians, by and large, that are doing that. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8880.82s)]
*  So it's really hilarious. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8884.82s)]
*  It's like you guys are you don't even look, you don't even open the goddamn book. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8885.82s)]
*  One of them famously or infamously to me, because I drag him for it frequently said, if it looks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, well, I hope you understand. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8891.82s)]
*  And it's like, well, I understand between us talking, but I do not fucking understand that for a scientist. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8899.82s)]
*  Fuck you on that. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8904.82s)]
*  If your if your job is to test chemicals, to figure out which one does what you don't say, well, it kind of looks like this one. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8905.82s)]
*  So I'll skip it. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8910.82s)]
*  You fucking test each one. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8911.82s)]
*  Same thing here. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8912.82s)]
*  Hypothesis comes at you. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8914.82s)]
*  You don't get to be like, well, it kind of resembles the one that that one cook came up with. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8915.82s)]
*  We'll reject it. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8919.82s)]
*  You test it or you don't call it science. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8920.82s)]
*  You call it guesswork. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8922.82s)]
*  Well, it's also really interesting with when in regards to go back to Tappi that they've essentially put a giant halt on the amount of excavations being done there. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8924.82s)]
*  And they've even planted trees over the areas that have not been excavated yet. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8933.82s)]
*  Yeah, they've done. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8937.82s)]
*  Yeah, some of the tree footage that I've seen is just a port. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8939.82s)]
*  And isn't the art the trees are protected species of tree. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8944.82s)]
*  Yep. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8947.82s)]
*  So you can't cut them down. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8948.82s)]
*  Can't cut them down. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8949.82s)]
*  And why would you do that? [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8950.82s)]
*  Well, why would you do that over one of the most important historical sites in human history? [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8952.82s)]
*  Well, the guy that did it like he owns the site. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8957.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8959.82s)]
*  And then they find it. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8960.82s)]
*  And now he's trying to sell it or not trying to sell. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8961.82s)]
*  Excuse me. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8963.82s)]
*  The government comes like 10 years later and tells them that they're going to buy it. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8964.82s)]
*  And it's just like if you're like if the government's going to build a highway, it doesn't matter how much you paid for your home. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8967.82s)]
*  Doesn't matter what you got on your property. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8973.82s)]
*  They're going to come and look at it and they have an equation form. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8975.82s)]
*  And that's all that matters. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8978.82s)]
*  The swimming pool is not on that form. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8980.82s)]
*  Fucking swimming pool doesn't get paid for. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8981.82s)]
*  Well, on this farmland, adding olive trees made that an orchard instead of basically arid farmland. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8983.82s)]
*  Made it more valuable. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8990.82s)]
*  Made it more valuable. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8992.82s)]
*  But what's funny about this is like we talk about the arguments against this stuff and how stupid it is. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=8993.82s)]
*  OK, Jim points out that these trees are a problem. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9000.82s)]
*  And since it's Jim and Jim is fucking public enemy number one to archaeologists, but I'm coming to get you, Jim. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9003.82s)]
*  It's going to be my spot soon. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9008.82s)]
*  But anyway, since Jim is fucking hated by these guys, it doesn't matter. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9010.82s)]
*  There is tons of documentation on the problems with having tree roots above a site. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9017.82s)]
*  All the way from contamination with different microbes to they use a certain species of snail in Europe to determine certain dates. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9022.82s)]
*  And tree roots that punch right through that shit and introduce that snail to places it shouldn't be. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9029.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9035.82s)]
*  Tree roots will if one of those enclosures that go Beckley Tepe is filled with water, had a well in it. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9036.82s)]
*  All those roots are screaming down that thing and just blowing it to shit. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9042.82s)]
*  It's gone. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9045.82s)]
*  So there's a number of things archaeologists, everything I just told you, that's shit archaeologists say. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9046.82s)]
*  I learned all that from reading papers about what the problem that tree roots can cause to archaeological sites, because everybody knows they cause any. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9051.82s)]
*  It's all the construction guys know they cause problems with foundations, but they don't care. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9059.82s)]
*  They'll argue all day. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9063.82s)]
*  Oh, those tree roots aren't so bad. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9065.82s)]
*  That's a protective. It's not such a big. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9066.82s)]
*  It's all because Jim mentioned it had Flint mentioned it first. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9068.82s)]
*  They would be all up in arms about taking that taking care of those trees. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9070.82s)]
*  It's it's so clearly Red Rover, Red Rover. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9073.82s)]
*  It's all about teams. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9077.82s)]
*  It's just it's just stupid. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9078.82s)]
*  It's a point where it's just it's reprehensible in times, to be honest with you. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9080.82s)]
*  It's just shocking that steps haven't been taken to mitigate that when you consider that this is one of the most important archaeological sites ever. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9084.82s)]
*  So it threw the monkey wrench into the whole idea that people were capable of building stuff like that only around 6000 years ago. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9093.82s)]
*  Yeah, it blasted that on its ear. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9103.82s)]
*  Like you were saying earlier, I remember I drive me nuts because I can't find the clip, but I remember seeing it years ago of Graham talking to somebody and the guy saying, we'll show me the civilization. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9105.82s)]
*  Yeah, that was with Zoe Hawass. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9119.82s)]
*  And there was another archaeologist, the guy with glasses. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9121.82s)]
*  Yeah, that he was saying it openly dismissive in the most disgusting way. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9124.82s)]
*  Where's the evidence? [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9127.82s)]
*  Then they find it. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9130.82s)]
*  But back in those days, the standard operating model for humans becoming from hunter gatherer or hunter gatherers to civilization was you were had to start farming and then you created a surplus of food. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9131.82s)]
*  And once you had enough of a surplus of food for long enough, you started to have these ruling classes emerge. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9145.82s)]
*  You get your astronomers and your priests and your shamans and all these guys don't want to work. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9150.82s)]
*  And so pretty soon you get these cities going and shit. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9156.82s)]
*  But this can only happen. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9159.82s)]
*  We have a huge surplus of food because that's obviously just wasted labor. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9161.82s)]
*  We'll go back to TepÃ© really threw that on its ear because there ain't no goddamn farming right then. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9165.82s)]
*  It's the beginnings of it. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9169.82s)]
*  There ain't no surplus of food there. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9170.82s)]
*  There's no surplus of human created food. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9172.82s)]
*  You might be finding lots of animal bones and shit, but it wasn't like they grew a bunch of food. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9175.82s)]
*  So it completely destroyed that entire narrative. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9180.82s)]
*  And that's the part that because it's a Graham Hancock site, they will they're slow to really admit that. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9183.82s)]
*  But go buy a book from the 90s and read about how how humans progressed from and you buy an anthropology book and you'll see it very clear that that they completely had to rewrite shit because it go back to TepÃ©. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9190.82s)]
*  Yeah. And it's also it's a weird one, too, because they know it was intentionally covered up 11000 years ago. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9200.82s)]
*  That's not that that one's wild. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9207.82s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9209.82s)]
*  That's one thing it's been pushed back on a lot, but it does look like that's there's papers published both ways, but it does look like last I saw it does look like that the consensus is it was buried. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9210.82s)]
*  What's the pushback? [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9221.82s)]
*  The sides of the hill would like collapse into the thing. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9222.82s)]
*  And so that they would just eventually just kind of push some more of it in there and just leveled it out so they could use the area because it was a bunch of holes in the ground. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9226.82s)]
*  You couldn't walk your donkeys over anything. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9234.82s)]
*  I know it's a little bit a lot of work. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9236.82s)]
*  There's a lot of areas around it. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9238.82s)]
*  You can walk your donkeys. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9239.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like the whole area. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9240.82s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9242.82s)]
*  I think they go back to TepÃ© like any of those. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9244.82s)]
*  I don't think I'm well aware just like the because Jimmy's involved with it. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9248.82s)]
*  Anything Graham Hancock touches those guys. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9253.82s)]
*  They they're they're going to poo poo. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9256.82s)]
*  They're just going to dismiss it. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9259.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9260.82s)]
*  And it's sad because like he is them hitting him with the racist thing in particular. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9261.82s)]
*  That's good. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9268.82s)]
*  You know, Graham, that's that that hits him. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9269.82s)]
*  That fucking hurts. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9271.82s)]
*  He's very sensitive. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9272.82s)]
*  He doesn't. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9273.82s)]
*  And that kind of shit, man. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9274.82s)]
*  There are people in that are Atlantis hunters today. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9275.82s)]
*  There's the guy, Robert Safir. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9278.82s)]
*  I hate to say his name even, but I will because he needs to be put on blast a bit. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9281.82s)]
*  This guy is he's an Atlantis bro. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9285.82s)]
*  He thinks that the DNA story that we've been told out of Africa is wrong. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9287.82s)]
*  OK, fine. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9292.82s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9293.82s)]
*  Where the rubber hits the road is when he starts seeing he'll show like pictures of like old school anthropological models of proto humans that are real dark skin and big hair coming out and looking half monkey, half man. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9294.82s)]
*  And then he'll say there's no way that this could come from the same stock and then show like a little six year old Danish girl with perfect fucking big blue eyes. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9308.82s)]
*  And this is this kind of constant, constant digs at at Africans, not out of Africa, but at Africa. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9316.82s)]
*  They were all these different species bred with different hominids. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9325.82s)]
*  And these guys bred with the stupid ones and these other guys bred with smart ones and these guys bred with strong ones. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9329.82s)]
*  It's very it's racist for lack of a better term. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9335.82s)]
*  It might not even be what you would consider white supremacist, but it's definitely when you're done with if you were to take everything he said and accept it, you would walk away thinking that different groups of humans are clearly better than each other genetically. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9339.82s)]
*  Fucking hands down. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9354.82s)]
*  You can judge it based on skin. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9355.82s)]
*  So that is racist, right? [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9357.82s)]
*  What does that have to do with Atlantis? [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9359.82s)]
*  Well, he's believes that Atlantis was like the people that spread the ideas around and stuff kind of the same stuff I was saying earlier about that Ignatius Donnelly guy. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9361.82s)]
*  So he is so he is what you would think. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9369.82s)]
*  He's got 300,000 subscribers or so on YouTube. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9372.82s)]
*  He's not a nobody. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9374.82s)]
*  So you would think he's the guy that these guys would be poking at for being a fucking racist, but they don't. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9375.82s)]
*  And there's a real big reason why they almost never do like two people with any following at all that have letters next to their name. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9381.82s)]
*  They're taking shots at this guy on YouTube. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9387.82s)]
*  And the reason is it's he's he is what they actually claim Graham is. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9389.82s)]
*  So it's it's like if you have somebody that's complaining about a trans activist, the one that's screaming, call me ma'am. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9396.82s)]
*  That's what they're trying to say. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9405.82s)]
*  Graham is. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9406.82s)]
*  But actually, that's what Robert is. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9407.82s)]
*  And then Graham's just would be standing there being like, hey, how's it going? [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9409.82s)]
*  So the problem is, if you pay attention to that guy and you see the real racist, then it doesn't work when you call grammar race that you can't call him a racist anymore. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9412.82s)]
*  Yeah. And so they also they probably don't want to give him any attention. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9419.82s)]
*  Well, they don't they give him attention. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9422.82s)]
*  They talk about him. They do. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9423.82s)]
*  They just like I said, I didn't want to mention his name and I know I'm going to get people yelling at me about saying that. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9425.82s)]
*  But it's the stuff that he puts out is very clearly. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9431.82s)]
*  If you were to again, if you take it all on board, it would be very you would be a racist. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9434.82s)]
*  If you were to just accept it all, you'd be like, oh, well, that guy's black. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9437.82s)]
*  He's just not as smart as me. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9440.82s)]
*  Sorry. Fuck. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9441.82s)]
*  There's a clip for you, Flint. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9442.82s)]
*  Have fun with that. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9443.82s)]
*  So the the one of the things that I saw on your channel in regards to Atlantis was this alloy that they found these ingots. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9444.82s)]
*  They found this. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9456.82s)]
*  I'm having trouble also. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9458.82s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, call him. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9460.82s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9462.82s)]
*  Something like and it's a combination of allium zinc and what is it? [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9463.82s)]
*  Zinc and copper and silver, I think it was like it's thinking. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9468.82s)]
*  Mostly zinc and copper. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9473.82s)]
*  Maybe it was a tiny bit of silver. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9474.82s)]
*  It might have just been zinc and copper. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9476.82s)]
*  And they they have found shipwrecks that have this stuff in it. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9477.82s)]
*  And it was written about before, too, like like it wasn't just written about with Atlantis like they'd written about it. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9481.82s)]
*  It was metal that the Greeks used. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9487.82s)]
*  It was basically from one from one little mountain region. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9489.82s)]
*  And I have one of your videos I was watching yesterday. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9493.82s)]
*  I could find it. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9495.82s)]
*  It's a Jamie. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9496.82s)]
*  Did you find Jamie? [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9497.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9498.82s)]
*  That's it. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9499.82s)]
*  That's the word. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9500.82s)]
*  Yep. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9501.82s)]
*  Or a callium or a callium metal and callicum maybe I don't know. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9502.82s)]
*  Covered from shipwreck off Sicily. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9505.82s)]
*  Yep. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9507.82s)]
*  That's it. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9508.82s)]
*  So this was an early version of a metal that they had created. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9509.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9514.82s)]
*  Well, they think that it might be an alloy that was found, but they that it was like naturally occurring copper that way. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9515.82s)]
*  They're not 100 percent, I believe. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9523.82s)]
*  But you can make it. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9526.82s)]
*  We could. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9527.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9528.82s)]
*  As an alloy. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9529.82s)]
*  We could. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9530.82s)]
*  And what's interesting is it does talk about that in and you scroll up. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9531.82s)]
*  I read that it says today. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9534.82s)]
*  Most scholars agree that or callium is a brass like alloy which was made in antiquity by cementation. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9537.82s)]
*  The process was achieved with the reaction of zinc or charcoal and copper metal in a crucible. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9544.82s)]
*  Analyzed by X ray. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9551.82s)]
*  How's that? [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9553.82s)]
*  Fluorescence with X ray fluorescence fluorescence fluorescence. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9554.82s)]
*  By Dario Panetta of TQ Technologies for Quality. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9559.82s)]
*  The 39 ingots turned to be an alloy made with 75 to 80 percent copper, 15, 20 percent zinc and small percentages of nickel lead and iron. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9563.82s)]
*  What would be the benefit of that alloy? [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9571.82s)]
*  It was considered like beautiful like gold, but cheaper, easier to get. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9573.82s)]
*  And second only to golden value was found in and mined in many parts of legendary Atlantis Nation times. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9579.82s)]
*  Yeah, the they said that the temple walls in Atlantis were supposed to have been covered with that stuff. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9588.82s)]
*  But that's where you know myself and I know this. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9594.82s)]
*  I think that there's a really good chance that a lot of the evidence that we have a lot of the written records, the myths and stuff of Atlantis, I think a lot of that's going to have a cultural infusion so heavy into it that a lot of the details will get lost. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9598.82s)]
*  And you could almost just be like there was a civilization that was more advanced than the people that wrote about him. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9612.82s)]
*  And that's almost all you could take away sometimes. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9618.82s)]
*  Like like the Greeks of Atlantis happened to be a democratic society. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9620.82s)]
*  Well, no shit. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9626.82s)]
*  The Greeks, they valued that democracy. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9627.82s)]
*  It was something they were real proud of. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9629.82s)]
*  So, of course, this great place was democratic. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9630.82s)]
*  And of course, they had the same that rich ass metal. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9633.82s)]
*  Why can't they cover their temples in that ship? [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9636.82s)]
*  It's to me, it seemed you know what I mean? [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9638.82s)]
*  It's just like a lot of people say that the whole thing, you know, that Plato just use Atlantis as an allegory or a myth. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9640.82s)]
*  What is this, Jamie? [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9647.82s)]
*  Brass. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9648.82s)]
*  I'll say chemical analysis. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9650.82s)]
*  The ingots found 2015 shipwrecked high quality brass brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9652.82s)]
*  While the ancient Greeks did not know metallic zinc, they knew zinc coating ores and the description that or a callium has similar color and shine as gold fits well with the properties of brass. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9658.82s)]
*  Well, brass is not exactly a precious metal. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9668.82s)]
*  It does not corrode and is widely used on jewelry, marine instruments and medical instruments. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9670.82s)]
*  Goldsmiths and jewelers describe brass as mahogany of metals. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9675.82s)]
*  Wasn't that that that device? [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9678.82s)]
*  I don't remember how to say the word. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9681.82s)]
*  Anti-kithrum. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9683.82s)]
*  Anti-kithrum. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9684.82s)]
*  Wasn't that made out of brass as well? [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9685.82s)]
*  Part of it was brass, yes. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9686.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9687.82s)]
*  That thing's crazy. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9688.82s)]
*  That thing is insane. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9689.82s)]
*  That thing is insane. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9690.82s)]
*  It shows some serious thinking going on, serious planning. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9691.82s)]
*  And as I said numerous times, I think that if it didn't look so clunky when they found it, I don't think that we'd have it. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9695.82s)]
*  I think it ended up on some rich guy's shelf because it's way too fucking cool. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9702.82s)]
*  But they looked at it just like, yeah, there's like a mass of metal with like some gear frozen to it. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9705.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9710.82s)]
*  It's all corroding. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9711.82s)]
*  And then they bring it up and hand it off. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9712.82s)]
*  Oh, fuck me. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9714.82s)]
*  Look what we got here. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9715.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9716.82s)]
*  I mean, that's you know, that looks kind of cool, but it doesn't look nearly as it just looks like a wheel. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9717.82s)]
*  And it was found next to a bunch of statues. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9721.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9723.82s)]
*  So they had stuff of real value as far as they were concerned. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9724.82s)]
*  Well, it's really fascinating is the 3D analysis of what it was and how it worked. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9727.82s)]
*  See if you can find that when they show like that's it right there. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9732.82s)]
*  This is the 3D analysis of what it was and how it worked. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9737.82s)]
*  This is the depiction of what it looked like when it was actually functional. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9741.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9745.82s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is that thing? [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9746.82s)]
*  And this was some sort of super sophisticated calendar, right? [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9750.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9754.82s)]
*  Basically, you know, that thing at school where you would. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9755.82s)]
*  I thought it was how they traveled. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9758.82s)]
*  No, it says weather patterns and stuff. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9760.82s)]
*  No, it does have other star phases and weather patterns. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9762.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9765.82s)]
*  You know those things that you in high school or college where you turn a crank and the sun and all the planets go around it, right? [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9766.82s)]
*  Corresponding weather predictions and star phases. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9774.82s)]
*  You can correspond weather with star phases. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9776.82s)]
*  I guess if you're doing a calendar, right? [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9779.82s)]
*  So if you're looking at when when is it going to be winter? [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9782.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9785.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9786.82s)]
*  Oh, fucking cool. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9787.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty impressive. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9788.82s)]
*  That's like way earlier than anybody thought anybody had a mechanical clock. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9789.82s)]
*  Well, yeah, there's stuff I haven't researched for a long time, but I remember that's what it looks like. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9794.82s)]
*  So it's separate. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9800.82s)]
*  Someone making a planetary thing. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9801.82s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9803.82s)]
*  Yeah, I was saying it's effectively that's the same kind of thing. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9805.82s)]
*  Basically, that's what it's based on. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9809.82s)]
*  All those little. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9810.82s)]
*  Well, no, it's just those are based on it or the a kids are mechanisms way before that. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9811.82s)]
*  Right. Like, yeah. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9818.82s)]
*  So what year was this supposedly? [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9819.82s)]
*  I want to say like 1500 BC or something. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9821.82s)]
*  But I might be might be 500. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9824.82s)]
*  OK, is that what it said? [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9827.82s)]
*  Jim discovered in 1901 second century BC. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9829.82s)]
*  Oh, so 200 BC. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9834.82s)]
*  But there was definitely more than one of those. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9836.82s)]
*  Oh, God, that's what's crazy. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9839.82s)]
*  So this is the whole thing when you talk about ancient technology. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9841.82s)]
*  If this is only two thousand two hundred years ago, fifteen thousand years ago, you're going to find shit like that is so much longer. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9844.82s)]
*  And if you think about how eroded that is, if that thing was still in the ocean ten thousand years from now, there'd be nothing left. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9852.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other thing that's really gross about the whole shipwreck dismissal is that these ships are made out of wood. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9858.82s)]
*  The wood would be gone. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9864.82s)]
*  This idea that would all be preserved because of cold water. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9865.82s)]
*  There's no evidence of that. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9867.82s)]
*  There's evidence of things that are like six hundred years old, thousand years old. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9868.82s)]
*  As soon as you get older than that, you get nothing but the pottery and the jewelry on the floor of the ocean. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9871.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9876.82s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9877.82s)]
*  It's yeah, we don't we don't we don't have fuck off or shipwrecks way back in those days. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9878.82s)]
*  And those ships that are preserved from even close to like ten thousand years ago aren't ships at all fucking canoes that are found in bogs and places. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9883.82s)]
*  Right. If it's in the ocean, it's not. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9891.82s)]
*  It's Swiss cheese after a few a few thousand years. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9893.82s)]
*  You can have nothing left. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9896.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9897.82s)]
*  One of the things that really is sad about that whole deal is it's you know, there was a potential for a real good discussion to be had there. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9898.82s)]
*  Flint does know a lot about archaeology and he could have sat down with Graham and had a good conversation about this stuff. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9907.82s)]
*  But if you in order to do that, he would have had to have not construed it as a debate in his mind. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9915.82s)]
*  I mean, I clearly was just still going to get labeled as such. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9921.82s)]
*  But by making a debate in his head, it's like you have to win. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9924.82s)]
*  You have to win. And how do you have to sew holes that can't be sewn shut if we're talking about like that with those shipwrecks? [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9929.82s)]
*  Oh, well, they've got to make sure that there's no shipwrecks. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9937.82s)]
*  You've got to make sure that there's no place for him to speculate whatsoever because and that's just like a dude. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9939.82s)]
*  So you end up with because he's still right in one way. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9945.82s)]
*  Right. And the way he's right is there's no evidence of a ten thousand year old shipwreck. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9948.82s)]
*  No, there is no evidence of a ten thousand year old shipwreck. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9952.82s)]
*  That's all you have to say. And you have to say, well, we have to make a giant leap if you want to assume that people were seafarers. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9954.82s)]
*  But it is possible. And if it's possible that two thousand years ago, like what we do, we really know for absolute certainty what year the boat was invented. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9959.82s)]
*  Thank you. But I'll tell you something that's kind of painful and hilarious, but sad about this. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9968.82s)]
*  You know, Flint, they're closing the anthropology department at this university Flint teaches that right now. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9974.82s)]
*  They're closing down other anthropology departments and archaeology departments across the world right now, across the country. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9981.82s)]
*  There's I just posted one a couple of days ago. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9987.82s)]
*  Flint was sitting here with Graham talking to you and there was the opportunity for him to say, we do need to do more investigation. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=9991.82s)]
*  Graham, I completely agree with you, which is why I think we need to get some people out there to do some underwater archaeology. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10001.82s)]
*  Where do you think, Graham? We don't see it. He could be drumming up business with and and then the two then at the very least, even if even if he looked down his nose at everything, Graham had to say. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10006.82s)]
*  The cheddar comes in, the investigations happen and everybody's happy. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10018.82s)]
*  Instead, we end with their closing his fucking department. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10024.82s)]
*  I mean, dude, I just it to me, it's just such a I mean, there might not necessarily be directly related, but he had an opportunity that he completely didn't just piss it away. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10029.82s)]
*  He just drove it into the ground, did the opposite of what he should have done with it. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10038.82s)]
*  And they do that as a matter of course. Jimmy Corsetti brought up once about a year ago on Twitter. He's like, oh, yeah, you know, I think the Nephilim in the Bible, it talks about the giants and Nephilim. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10043.82s)]
*  I think maybe that might be an extinct species of hominid and maybe Denisovans, maybe Neanderthal. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10053.82s)]
*  So instead of being like, yeah, it's interesting, man. But you know what? [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10059.82s)]
*  Denisovans and Neanderthal are both the wrong size for they would neither one of them were bigger than humans, so they couldn't be giants. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10062.82s)]
*  You need to look into gigantopithecus or maybe some other and sent Jim on on to go learn about science. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10068.82s)]
*  Instead, they said, no, it's fucking stupid. Both of these are smaller than that. God, this Jimmy Corsetti guy's a fucking grifter. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10074.82s)]
*  God, he's stupid. And then I come along and point out that you had you missed opportunity here, guys. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10080.82s)]
*  Why are you doing it like this? Why are you being dicks instead of trying? You're here trying to be a science educator, right? [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10087.82s)]
*  Right. He has a bigger platform than you, right? [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10092.82s)]
*  The giant thing is always weird to me because there's so many people that believe in kooky shit that want to believe there was giants and that there's the they hit them. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10095.82s)]
*  Smithsonian, they've got them tucked away. Why? Why would they hide giants? [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10104.82s)]
*  Like, what would society fall apart if we knew that at one point in time there were 11 foot men running around? [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10108.82s)]
*  And what happened to them? Maybe they're just like a lot of other large animals that just like they need too many resources. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10114.82s)]
*  They ate them all and that's why they're gone. Yeah. But maybe they're just dumb as shit and huge. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10120.82s)]
*  We ate them. We killed them. Maybe we got tired of them raiding our villages and they couldn't figure out weapons because they were so big they never had to. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10125.82s)]
*  If we do know that there's tiny hobbit people, why wouldn't we assume that, look, if the tallest humans are like, what's the tallest guy ever? He's like nine feet tall. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10133.82s)]
*  Eight foot three. Robert Wadlow. I grew up near him. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10140.82s)]
*  So let's imagine something two feet bigger than that. That's not so hard to believe that there was a bunch of them. Is that hard to believe? [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10143.82s)]
*  If we find out that there was a little hobbit people and if we find out there was Denisovans and what's those big headed people that they found? [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10150.82s)]
*  We were talking about it. They found in China the extra large skulls. It's a very recent discovery. We were just talking about it. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10156.82s)]
*  So they thought at one point in time they were Denisovans and now they think it's a completely separate chain. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10164.82s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. They're always hunting these new little weird humans. But these big headed people, they had like large brows and their skulls were much larger than ours. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10169.82s)]
*  Yeah. And we just had, we pulled images of them the other day. Remember? They looked giant. We had jacked versions of it. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10180.82s)]
*  We literally call them just the large head people. I don't have a better name for it. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10187.82s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck. Big head people discovered. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10191.82s)]
*  I did. Literally the website says large head people. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10196.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10200.82s)]
*  I don't have a better name for it. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10201.82s)]
*  But remember we did find a better name the other day. That's it. Those are the people. That's the article. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10203.82s)]
*  So this is December 2024. So it was really recent. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10208.82s)]
*  Wow. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10212.82s)]
*  Provocative new piece of nature proposed a whole new group of ancient humans, cousins of the Denisovans and Neanderthals, that once lived alongside Homo sapiens in eastern Asia more than 100,000 years ago. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10213.82s)]
*  The brains of these extinct humans who probably hunted horses in small groups were much bigger than any other hominid of their time, including our own species. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10222.82s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10231.82s)]
*  Yeah. What bigger brain things like what is this thing? [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10232.82s)]
*  Jularin. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10236.82s)]
*  Jularin. Yeah. Google Jularin images. There's some cool fucking CGI versions of what they think this thing looks like. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10237.82s)]
*  Good images. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10247.82s)]
*  Damn. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10249.82s)]
*  There's one where he's like super jacked. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10251.82s)]
*  Oh, that's like that one over there far like that. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10254.82s)]
*  Super jacked primate that stands upright. Here's a weird one. How come all the intelligent things stand upright? Is it because you need your hands free? [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10261.82s)]
*  Because if you're walking on four legs, you never figure anything out because you're always using your hands to walk with. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10270.82s)]
*  That might be part of it. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10275.82s)]
*  Like you need to become bipedal. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10276.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10278.82s)]
*  Like. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10279.82s)]
*  Opposable thumbs. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10280.82s)]
*  Yeah. Well the aliens don't though. They gave up on that. They just want three digits. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10281.82s)]
*  Well that's because they all just do tablets now. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10284.82s)]
*  Yeah. They're so advanced. They're just scrolling. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10286.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10288.82s)]
*  I mean, I'd take a magazine and try to like. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10289.82s)]
*  I saw this today. This is the world's tallest woman meeting the world's smallest woman. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10291.82s)]
*  Wow. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10295.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10296.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10297.82s)]
*  Look how. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10298.82s)]
*  That's insane. And those are both human beings. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10299.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10300.82s)]
*  Right. At the same time. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10301.82s)]
*  Well one of the things that's interesting to me about the giant bones like the reports that they go. The things that they use to really their smoking gun is like there's a few reports from like the west coast and like Grand Canyon and shit. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10302.82s)]
*  And they would send these letters back being like or the real newspaper that this guy discovered these big giant bones and they're bringing them back. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10316.82s)]
*  And I'm of the opinion being the skeptical person I am. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10324.82s)]
*  I'm of the opinion that this was more of an announcement to the people back east that hey these things happen to get stolen along the way. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10328.82s)]
*  And I happen to find a bunch of money along the way. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10336.82s)]
*  Now is your chance because once they get to the Smithsonian boys they're theirs. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10338.82s)]
*  So I don't think any of them made it if these exist if they were giant bones at all I don't think a damn one of them made it to Smithsonian. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10342.82s)]
*  I think they got bought up and they're sitting there. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10349.82s)]
*  I mean fuck come on. These guys have some Jeff Bezos type character from 18 to collect in his house. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10351.82s)]
*  Archaeology became a field because you go over some skull and bone type dudes house. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10359.82s)]
*  Jesus Christ he's a giant metal metal plates on his face. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10364.82s)]
*  Real fucking real. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10369.82s)]
*  How many people have those little alien babies those little alien skeletons. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10371.82s)]
*  How many people I mean if people find out about that some crazy Chinese billionaire get me a little alien. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10376.82s)]
*  Come on. I want it for my my study. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10382.82s)]
*  And that's basically how that's you know that probably happens a lot right. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10384.82s)]
*  Because these archaeologists aren't making much money. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10387.82s)]
*  No and of course it happens like especially in the third world and shit. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10389.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. I mean and that's where all the not all but that's where a lot of the cool stuff is. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10394.82s)]
*  But you go to a place like that it's like your boy up in Alaska finds a spot and he because it's not human remains he can do whatever the fuck he wants. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10398.82s)]
*  Those were native remains would be a different story. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10406.82s)]
*  But and like he's pulling cash out of that. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10408.82s)]
*  But guys in other countries where they don't even get have enough to feed me look at how the dead sea scrolls were found right. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10412.82s)]
*  These buy them off of fucking little kids and shit right. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10418.82s)]
*  The people had no money like the kids throw rocks up there and then they find them and then the dudes buys the first ones were bought from the kids that found them. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10420.82s)]
*  Crazy. It's insane. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10428.82s)]
*  For nothing. Of course. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10429.82s)]
*  Imagine if they were just burned somewhere. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10431.82s)]
*  Imagine someone said this is heresy and lit them on fire like we would have lost it all like Library of Alexandria like all that all that shit that ISIS blew up. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10433.82s)]
*  All right. Right. Fuck. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10444.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10445.82s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10446.82s)]
*  That hurt. I've seen those videos was like bad. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10447.82s)]
*  I read that about the mummies. That's how they found them. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10450.82s)]
*  The Nazca mummies there was grave robbers because they're found in a cemetery area. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10452.82s)]
*  Someone found some weird ones I guess amongst the bodies. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10457.82s)]
*  And which ones do you think go and which ones do you think they took first. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10461.82s)]
*  Yeah. You walk in there and there's all these 200 of them. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10465.82s)]
*  One of them is really extra crazy. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10468.82s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10470.82s)]
*  Give me that one. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10471.82s)]
*  Give me the alien. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10472.82s)]
*  The giant head. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10473.82s)]
*  The reports that I told you Rockefeller got those big skulls the reports say that they gave him three or four bundles that were in desperate need of repair. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10474.82s)]
*  I call bullshit of that. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10482.82s)]
*  I think he got the four best motherfucking bundles they had. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10483.82s)]
*  Probably. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10486.82s)]
*  Probably got him set up with like a UFO in the background in his house. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10487.82s)]
*  Got to go to a secret room. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10490.82s)]
*  Look. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10492.82s)]
*  Visitors. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10493.82s)]
*  Behold. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10494.82s)]
*  They've been here forever. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10495.82s)]
*  One of the things I did want to ask you is one of the wackier theories that I read online was that there was a discovery of some sort of an Egyptian temple in the Grand Canyon. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10497.82s)]
*  Yes. I've heard this. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10506.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10507.82s)]
*  That's basically one guy's story. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10508.82s)]
*  It's cool. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10510.82s)]
*  I want to believe. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10511.82s)]
*  I want to believe too. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10512.82s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10513.82s)]
*  I want to believe too. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10514.82s)]
*  Why would they hide that from us? [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10515.82s)]
*  Well the only reason that there's a part of the Grand Canyon you can't go to. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10516.82s)]
*  That is true. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10521.82s)]
*  Why can't you go? [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10522.82s)]
*  What's the rule? [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10525.82s)]
*  I think it's to do with Native American stuff but I haven't dug too terribly into this to be honest with you. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10526.82s)]
*  Let them have a casino and let us go there. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10531.82s)]
*  It might even be because they're worried about people falling off the side of a cliff or something and dying. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10534.82s)]
*  But they die every day. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10539.82s)]
*  Yeah they do. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10540.82s)]
*  Not every day but like every year someone dies at the Grand Canyon. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10541.82s)]
*  But this is supposed to be that cave was supposed to be in that area and it's supposed to be like pretty hard to find, pretty inaccessible. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10544.82s)]
*  But yeah I was supposed to have all kinds of Egyptian relics and stuff in there. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10551.82s)]
*  Can you imagine if the government's been hiding that from us and UFOs? [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10554.82s)]
*  You guys found an Egyptian temple in the Grand Canyon. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10557.82s)]
*  You hid it for so long you had to keep hiding it. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10560.82s)]
*  Otherwise you would have been an asshole five years ago, a hundred years ago. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10563.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10566.82s)]
*  It's like we don't ever ever admit we were assholes so we'll just like keep it hidden forever and ever. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10567.82s)]
*  We'll know who killed JFK before we get to see what's in that cave. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10571.82s)]
*  Allegedly. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10575.82s)]
*  Allegedly. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10576.82s)]
*  Yeah I'm not buying anything. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10577.82s)]
*  No. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10578.82s)]
*  No. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10579.82s)]
*  What's going to release the documents? [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10580.82s)]
*  Sure. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10581.82s)]
*  Once they said they were going to release the documents I was like sweet I'm going to go look into it and they're like oh I was just going to take a couple three. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10582.82s)]
*  Okay fuck you. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10589.82s)]
*  Well they have to go through it all. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10590.82s)]
*  You know. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10592.82s)]
*  Because they haven't done that yet. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10593.82s)]
*  Yeah I don't know. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10595.82s)]
*  Well I get it. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10597.82s)]
*  I just it's if the family you know maybe it could be the grandson of one of the people involved has got power or something nowadays. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10599.82s)]
*  It doesn't really matter a whole lot. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10607.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10609.82s)]
*  It's like just if there's power involved they're just going to kick that. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10610.82s)]
*  Especially if somehow or another you could show that those people profited from that power and then that family's inherited that money and they'd be held liable. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10613.82s)]
*  Oh boy oh boy oh boy. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol7PofIyZPI&t=10621.82s)]
