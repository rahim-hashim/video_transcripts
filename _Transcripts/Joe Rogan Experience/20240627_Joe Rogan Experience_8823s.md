# Joe Rogan Experience #1885   Andy Stumpf & Mike Sarraille
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6.0s)]
*  So tell me about your dip problem. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=10.0s)]
*  Tell us about your disgusting mouth. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=14.0s)]
*  Is this how I start? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=16.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=17.0s)]
*  So, you know, you talked about high school. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=18.0s)]
*  You did in high school. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=21.0s)]
*  I did it one time. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=22.0s)]
*  He's got to turn it on you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=23.0s)]
*  You did it one time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=24.0s)]
*  One time in high school and never touched it again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=25.0s)]
*  Go ahead, Mr. 19 years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=27.0s)]
*  Michael's just saying that he had to get his skin grafted. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=28.0s)]
*  And he's like, you did it once. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=31.0s)]
*  Well, I remember the first time I did it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=33.0s)]
*  Somebody gave me red man, a jaw. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=35.0s)]
*  And it was over. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=37.0s)]
*  I was just yakking everywhere. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=39.0s)]
*  Where I started was in the Marine Corps. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=41.0s)]
*  Is when we're in a hide site, you have to stay awake when it's your turn for security. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=43.0s)]
*  But that could be like 3 a.m. in the morning after you've been hiking for like six hours. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=49.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=53.0s)]
*  So eventually my team leader is like, you are going to put a dip in to do whatever it takes to stay awake during your watch. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=54.0s)]
*  Does dip keep you awake? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=60.0s)]
*  Nicotine does. It should. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=62.0s)]
*  But dip will? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=64.0s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=65.0s)]
*  And so it morphed from there in the Marines. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=67.0s)]
*  And we lived, I like to say we lived off of three things on deployment. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=70.0s)]
*  Water, coffee, and dip. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=74.0s)]
*  And even on a patrol with these guys, I would have a dip in, chewing caffeine gum, and drinking water. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=76.0s)]
*  Super healthy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=83.0s)]
*  I'm going to send this to Brendan Chubb. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=84.0s)]
*  Because that motherfucker keeps, he has those little pouches. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=86.0s)]
*  They're so nasty. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=89.0s)]
*  He keeps four or five of them in his mouth at a time. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=90.0s)]
*  He looks like a squirrel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=93.0s)]
*  Like he's got a little, like he's storing nuts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=94.0s)]
*  So now you have to get grafted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=97.0s)]
*  So you have to have skin grafted. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=99.0s)]
*  So they take the tissue from the top of your mouth and then graft it to the bottom of the teeth because it's receded quite a bit. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=100.0s)]
*  Hold on. One second. Sorry. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=108.0s)]
*  Are you good now? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=110.0s)]
*  Okay. So what did it do to your mouth? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=111.0s)]
*  I think after 10 years of, so I did switch from long cut to pouches. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=115.0s)]
*  And then not pouches. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=122.0s)]
*  Mike, that makes a fucking difference. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=125.0s)]
*  There was a logical progression. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=127.0s)]
*  I switched from beer to vodka. It's totally fine, guys. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=129.0s)]
*  I went from heroin to pills. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=133.0s)]
*  So the intent was long cut to pouches, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=135.0s)]
*  And pouches you would wean yourself off and that did not work. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=139.0s)]
*  And so what is it? Is it rotting your gums? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=142.0s)]
*  It just recedes your gums. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=145.0s)]
*  It doesn't rot your gums, but it recedes it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=147.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=149.0s)]
*  So you have yuck mouth. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=150.0s)]
*  I don't have yuck mouth. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=151.0s)]
*  Let me see. Let me see it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=152.0s)]
*  How bad is it? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=154.0s)]
*  First off, I'm here just to debunk or fact check anything that Andy says. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=156.0s)]
*  Andy, people know you. Andy Stump. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=161.0s)]
*  Andy Stump. Mike, please introduce yourself. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=163.0s)]
*  Tell you how you know this degenerate. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=165.0s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=167.0s)]
*  I'm actually embarrassed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=168.0s)]
*  Mike Cirelli, born in California as well, enlisted in the Marine Corps, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=169.0s)]
*  was a recon Marine and a scout sniper and eventually crossed over to the SEAL teams as an officer [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=173.0s)]
*  and retired after 20 years like Andy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=178.0s)]
*  We served at the same place, but I've got to tell you about the first time I met Andy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=181.0s)]
*  Because people ask me like, what's Andy Stump like? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=187.0s)]
*  Because I meet people that are like, oh, Andy Stump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=189.0s)]
*  He is a real dick. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=191.0s)]
*  Andy is a dick. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=193.0s)]
*  It's always been nice to me. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=195.0s)]
*  How weird. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=196.0s)]
*  I don't remember the story. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=197.0s)]
*  Always been a good friend. Always been friendly. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=199.0s)]
*  The story here, he's a great sense of humor. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=201.0s)]
*  Handsome guy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=203.0s)]
*  Little reckless. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=204.0s)]
*  So we're at SEAL Team 3 and SEAL teams are younger. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=205.0s)]
*  The average age is what? I think like 19 to 23. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=209.0s)]
*  At a conventional team? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=212.0s)]
*  Early 20s at best. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=213.0s)]
*  Early 20s at best. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=214.0s)]
*  And so there's a bunch of officers in the operations room at SEAL Team 3. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=215.0s)]
*  And we're talking. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=220.0s)]
*  There's a lot of group think going on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=221.0s)]
*  We're bad mouthing the leadership on a decision that was made. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=223.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden this guy walks in. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=226.0s)]
*  He's in his uniform, which is rare. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=228.0s)]
*  He must be checking in. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=231.0s)]
*  He's got this big stack of ribbons to our two rows of ribbons. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=232.0s)]
*  And we're talking. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=237.0s)]
*  He's listening in. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=238.0s)]
*  We sort of see this guy in the background. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=239.0s)]
*  And what was odd was you stepped in and you're like, I think you're all wrong. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=241.0s)]
*  And he killed us with logic. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=244.0s)]
*  Because remember, each of us has like two combat deployments at this point. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=246.0s)]
*  We think we have it all figured out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=250.0s)]
*  And Andy's coming in with his eight combat deployments and just destroys us. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=252.0s)]
*  What was he, what were you guys wrong about? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=256.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=258.0s)]
*  What were they saying? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=259.0s)]
*  I don't even fucking remember this interaction. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=261.0s)]
*  He was about to be making this all up. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=263.0s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=265.0s)]
*  So I forget the subject, but two of us left the room. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=267.0s)]
*  And I remember, I can't remember if I looked at him or he looked at me. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=271.0s)]
*  And he's like, was that guy a dick? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=275.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, he was a major dick. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=277.0s)]
*  But was I right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=279.0s)]
*  You were right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=280.0s)]
*  I think that was the problem that was wrong. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=281.0s)]
*  What were you guys wrong about? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=283.0s)]
*  So, you know, you get a little experience. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=285.0s)]
*  It's like the Dunning-Kruger effect. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=288.0s)]
*  You get a little experience under your belt and you think you have everything figured out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=290.0s)]
*  And for a young SEAL, whether enlisted or officer with two combat deployments, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=293.0s)]
*  you think you're the top dog. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=297.0s)]
*  The way the conventional SEAL teams work is that's a lot of combat experience [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=300.0s)]
*  for the conventional SEAL teams. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=303.0s)]
*  But he was coming from a different side, a side we all knew about, but knew very little about. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=305.0s)]
*  And we held them in high regard because that's the 2%. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=309.0s)]
*  He walks into the room and we knew once he stepped up, it was wrong. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=313.0s)]
*  But testament to Andy, he had a reputation for going against the group think [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=317.0s)]
*  and the SEAL teams have a lot of group think. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=321.0s)]
*  That's the easy answer is just to get on board. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=323.0s)]
*  We still haven't gotten to like what you guys were wrong about though. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=326.0s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=329.0s)]
*  I cannot recall. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=330.0s)]
*  All I recall is the incident. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=331.0s)]
*  I just remember being wrong. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=332.0s)]
*  But it was about combat and we thought we had it figured out. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=333.0s)]
*  He came in based off of his vast experience or vaster than ours. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=337.0s)]
*  You know what's interesting though? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=341.0s)]
*  Two combat deployments at a conventional SEAL team is four years. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=344.0s)]
*  Because you got to do an 18-month workup, six-month deployment, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=348.0s)]
*  maybe they'll push you out to 12 depending on what's going on operationally. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=350.0s)]
*  The deployments that I came back with was like three and a half years worth. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=355.0s)]
*  So the velocity that I was getting the experience was just crazy different [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=360.0s)]
*  in the compressed nature of it because it would be overseas for 90 back for 180, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=366.0s)]
*  overseas for 90 back for 180, and just constantly going and going and going and going. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=370.0s)]
*  So about the same amount of time but four times the amount of experience. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=374.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=378.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=379.0s)]
*  I will say the guys, I left SEAL team three and I went to where he was coming from [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=380.0s)]
*  when I called back because they were on deployment in Afghanistan. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=387.0s)]
*  They're like, dude, that guy rocks. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=390.0s)]
*  I mean, because he brought all this experience, all the planning experience. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=392.0s)]
*  And you basically embedded in a platoon. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=396.0s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=400.0s)]
*  I got a 300-win mag, a Javelin missile, and I just was laying heat down with both of those things. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=401.0s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=407.0s)]
*  They would say, what high ground position do you want to go to? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=411.0s)]
*  I'm like, this one looks good right here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=413.0s)]
*  So the guys, and after I heard that, the guys loved them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=417.0s)]
*  First impressions, I was totally wrong. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=421.0s)]
*  But how often does that happen, especially in SEAL teams where you meet a guy for the first time [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=423.0s)]
*  and you're like, I hate that guy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=427.0s)]
*  Well, I kind of think everybody's like super alpha, hyper aggressive, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=428.0s)]
*  and also a little bit of combat experience, fill a piss in vinegar. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=432.0s)]
*  And everything's a competition. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=437.0s)]
*  Everything is a competition. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=439.0s)]
*  Almost to a detriment. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=441.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=442.0s)]
*  How do the teams balance out that with camaraderie, the competitive with each other, but also camaraderie? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=443.0s)]
*  How do you avoid the internal conflict? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=449.0s)]
*  So I think there's a line you don't go beyond. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=453.0s)]
*  But you look at the civilian populace, one of the things that they totally lack is something called shared adversity [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=456.0s)]
*  that we have in spades. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=463.0s)]
*  And with guys you rolled with for years, you could not see them for 10 years. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=465.0s)]
*  You see them all of a sudden, it's like you saw each other last week. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=469.0s)]
*  When you go through BUDs or you go through the hard training, because BUDs is not the end of the hard training, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=472.0s)]
*  there's this homecoming belonging, this relationship, spirit of core built that will never die. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=477.0s)]
*  And so while we promote competition, it pays to be a winner, as we say, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=484.0s)]
*  there's a line at which if somebody wins, if Andy wins, the question now is, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=489.0s)]
*  OK, Andy, what did you do differently than us? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=493.0s)]
*  And share that, transfer that knowledge to us so that we can elevate our game as well. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=496.0s)]
*  So we understand, you know, proverbs, was it 2717? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=502.0s)]
*  Are you asking me? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=507.0s)]
*  I have absolutely no idea. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=508.0s)]
*  Iron sharpens iron as one man sharpens another. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=509.0s)]
*  So you understand that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=510.0s)]
*  But we understand competition makes the world go round to a point. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=511.0s)]
*  To a point. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=516.0s)]
*  To a point. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=517.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he's going to enter a room. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=518.0s)]
*  Well, first off, I'm an officer. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=520.0s)]
*  Nobody I wasn't entering any rooms. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=521.0s)]
*  He was for most of his career. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=523.0s)]
*  But, you know, I might be on his back and he's trusting me. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=524.0s)]
*  So if he's got knowledge, he's going to transfer that knowledge to me in training before we go to war [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=528.0s)]
*  to make sure that I'm the very best to cover his six. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=532.0s)]
*  The thing about things like whether it's SEALs or any high level military operation group, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=535.0s)]
*  whenever you're dealing with people that have done something that's extraordinarily difficult, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=543.0s)]
*  there's like a rite of passage that you guys have gone through that a lot of people think is missing [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=548.0s)]
*  from particularly young men in our society and culture. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=553.0s)]
*  There's no real moment where you recognize that you've you've done something incredibly difficult [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=557.0s)]
*  and you've actually become a man. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=563.0s)]
*  It almost seems like society is pushing it the other direction where that shouldn't exist or it should be avoided. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=565.0s)]
*  Even with the teams. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=570.0s)]
*  One of the things I hear is this narrative that it's too difficult. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=571.0s)]
*  I think you got to consider the source on that one. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=576.0s)]
*  You know, like the most recent thing that came out. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=579.0s)]
*  I'm sure you saw this, Mike, was the there was a video of training that occurred. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=581.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was on San Clemente Island because that's where they CS gassed us. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=586.0s)]
*  And there's guys who are outside and they're getting exposure to CS gas, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=589.0s)]
*  which I remember before I joined the military. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=594.0s)]
*  If you look at any movie, probably up to and including like Full Metal Jacket, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=597.0s)]
*  or if you even went into a recruiting office, exposure to CS gas is something that you do in basic training. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=601.0s)]
*  Except to the air. I don't know if the Air Force does it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=608.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. Let's assume that they do. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=612.0s)]
*  Probably they don't. But let's assume that they do. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=614.0s)]
*  It was completely standard and normal to see. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=616.0s)]
*  And that room sucks. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=620.0s)]
*  You go into a room, you have a gas mask on and they make you take it off and they make you either do something or say something or talk. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=622.0s)]
*  So you can't hold your breath. That's the point of all that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=627.0s)]
*  So this video comes out of students that are outside, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=629.0s)]
*  which one is actually a huge advantage because it dissipates quickly, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=633.0s)]
*  especially if there's any kind of wind and they're getting gassed. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=636.0s)]
*  And there's already issues with the story that I'm telling because one who the fuck is filming this? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=638.0s)]
*  Like it just the fact that there was somebody there who was filming this thing and it made it onto the Internet in any way, shape and form is a is a mistake in and of itself. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=642.0s)]
*  So it couldn't have been someone who was in the program. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=650.0s)]
*  There's no structure. It had to be an instructor. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=653.0s)]
*  So the students, the last four weeks of training, you go out to San Clemente Island. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=655.0s)]
*  It's called third phase and you get a very basic indoctrination into small unit tactics, rifle weaponry, explosives. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=660.0s)]
*  You throw some grenades, you do some underwater demo, but you're out there for like the last tight four weeks of training. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=669.0s)]
*  The students. I mean, I don't even remember having a cell phone when I went through actually in 97. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=676.0s)]
*  I'd be shocked if they're allowed to have cell phones on there. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=681.0s)]
*  So it had to have been an instructor, but they're getting gassed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=684.0s)]
*  They're being made to sing Happy Birthday again. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=687.0s)]
*  So you can't hold your breath and it looks horrible because it is horrible. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=690.0s)]
*  And the point of that training is, is it's supposed to suck. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=694.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be difficult. You're supposed to be exposed to that in a controlled training environment. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=697.0s)]
*  People like, well, this one person looked like they were passing out and there's mucus coming out of their face. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=704.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's CS gas. It sucks. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=708.0s)]
*  But the first time you experience that shouldn't be in a combat zone. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=711.0s)]
*  So it's a volunteer only program. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=714.0s)]
*  You can leave this particular training block if you want to at any given time. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=717.0s)]
*  And oh, by the way, every branch of the military exposes their people to this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=721.0s)]
*  So although there are people who are saying, yeah, it's too difficult, I think you have to consider the source. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=725.0s)]
*  I don't think they know what they're talking about. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=730.0s)]
*  We expose people to it on fear factor. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=732.0s)]
*  Yeah. Again, voluntary. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=735.0s)]
*  And if they officers and if they didn't want to, I bet you they can be like, you know what, Mr. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=738.0s)]
*  Rogan, I'm done with this episode like I'm out. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=742.0s)]
*  Yeah. So what what happened with that particular video? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=744.0s)]
*  It made its way onto the Internet and it because of what it looks like, it looks like exactly what it is. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=747.0s)]
*  A really shitty evolution where you can't breathe. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=755.0s)]
*  Your sinuses are running more than you ever have had them run in your life. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=758.0s)]
*  You can't see. You can barely talk. You're choking. You're gagging. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=761.0s)]
*  Some people throw up. So it made it onto the Internet and people started saying, how could you do that? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=764.0s)]
*  Like this? This is too brutal of training. How could you possibly do this? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=769.0s)]
*  That's weird that people on the Internet had opinions. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=772.0s)]
*  So they just had opinions. Did you just say it was weird that people on the Internet have opinions? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=776.0s)]
*  Clearly being sarcastic. OK. But the fact that anybody paid attention, those opinions, it trended for a while. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=781.0s)]
*  It actually not only did they have opinions, it started getting shared. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=787.0s)]
*  And then it started, you know, the next thing you know, it's on major news outlets. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=791.0s)]
*  And then I actually think I saw an article saying that the Navy opened an investigation into it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=795.0s)]
*  They have to. At that point, you have to. They should open an investigation. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=799.0s)]
*  Here it is. Navy launches investigation to seal tear gas video, newly surfaced video showing Navy SEAL recruits being tear gasses, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=803.0s)]
*  adding to scrutiny, adding to scrutiny over elite military units training practices. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=811.0s)]
*  But you I mean, you can speak to this, please, because you have to have brutal training. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=817.0s)]
*  So you have to layer on to this. I'm going to say this. Yeah, I remember going through this in the Marine Corps. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=823.0s)]
*  I cannot recall that evolution on San Clemente. And I asked somebody, oh, yeah, it happened. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=827.0s)]
*  I can't I can't remember. We went we went out into a demo range and they had sprinkled in CS powder into the dirt. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=832.0s)]
*  So we didn't actually realize we were having exposure to it. And people were just covered in. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=838.0s)]
*  I remember I'm sitting there. We were trying to do demo calculations or like cut debt cord and you're like dry heaving. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=844.0s)]
*  The reason I would say the reason that this is probably the bigger issue is that there was a high profile death in SEAL training not too long ago [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=850.0s)]
*  with a student who had just completed Hell Weekend died in the hospital shortly thereafter. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=856.0s)]
*  The young man's mother is a nurse and she's very vocal about what has happened. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=862.0s)]
*  And there was an investigation involving that. So it seems like not to I mean, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=867.0s)]
*  horrendous to lose your son in any way, shape or form. I don't want to take anything away from that. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=872.0s)]
*  But from that incident, you know, this is like another layer on top of the onion on something that people were already talking about, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=878.0s)]
*  which in you combine the two and it just seems like for one, I wish SEALs could get the fuck out of the news in general. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=884.0s)]
*  But since it starts, you know, they're layering on top of each other, it can seem to be a bigger deal than it is. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=891.0s)]
*  What did he die from? Infection. Yes. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=896.0s)]
*  So during Hell Week, you've got open source, you're in the water, which isn't far from the Tijuana where it drains off. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=899.0s)]
*  So there's that's always been a concern. We mitigate it extremely well. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=907.0s)]
*  And first off, my condolences to the mother, because this kid was a stud. He was the captain of the Yale football team. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=911.0s)]
*  He was going to become a SEAL. He passed the hardest. So it was like a staff infection. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=917.0s)]
*  It was a staff infection. And you look at the source, bacterial pneumonia, you look at the source. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=921.0s)]
*  This is all New York Times. It's a string of reporters in New York Times that have just been they've had a hard on for the SEAL teams. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=928.0s)]
*  They have been going out. In fact, they wrote a book and you have the author, Matt Cole, Code Over Country. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=936.0s)]
*  Yeah. And in they have just for the last half decade, if not more, have made it their personal crusade to bring down the SEAL teams. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=942.0s)]
*  And the Eddie Gallagher incident did not help. But here's what I'll say. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=954.0s)]
*  One, Eddie is a friend. Eddie didn't handle all situations well. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=959.0s)]
*  But it's amazing how Eddie can have and I think Eddie had like eight combat deployments, how he can serve honorably. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=962.0s)]
*  And he was number one at the SEAL team, his SEAL team, I think for E6, I believe. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=969.0s)]
*  He served honorably for 19 years in the last incident he's involved in, which he was acquitted for. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=974.0s)]
*  That defines his entire career. The last sentence of his chapter as a SEAL defines all the 19 years and all the good work that he did in defense of our nation for those who would never even think of serving. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=980.0s)]
*  And he was acquitted. What was the charge again? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=992.0s)]
*  It was something about a detainee. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=996.0s)]
*  I think the charge was murder. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=999.0s)]
*  Yes. It was a ISIS prisoner that had been wounded in a strike. And while rendering medical aid, they accused Eddie of murder. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1001.0s)]
*  But he was acquitted. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1012.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1014.0s)]
*  But they still don't appreciate that he was acquitted. Like they still treat him like he's guilty. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1015.0s)]
*  Some of the things I've seen in the press, and I'll keep reporters out of it, one, I can't remember their names, but a lot of the liberal news media just have painted him as a war criminal. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1021.0s)]
*  Bottom line. And his life has been impacted. If you look even at, so first off, NCIS. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1033.0s)]
*  Naval Criminal Investigation Service. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1040.0s)]
*  The branch in San Diego was never held held accountable for, let's just say, bad practices that they implemented while trying to bring Eddie down. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1042.0s)]
*  They also had a hard on. NCIS is not always your friend, and they're looking to make a name for themselves as well. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1052.0s)]
*  And in fact, I was I was investigated the day I retired by the same crew of people from NCIS San Diego, only six months previous to when the whole Eddie Gallagher thing sort of came on. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1060.0s)]
*  But I mean, they tapped or they put a bug into Eddie's lawyers emails so that they could read all the documents coming into that lawyer. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1073.0s)]
*  They did some pretty, pretty lame tactics and they were never never held accountable. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1083.0s)]
*  Is that is it legal to do that? No. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1090.0s)]
*  The initial lawyer was was fired, relieved, and they replaced him rapidly. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1094.0s)]
*  But was he relieved from military service? No, he was not. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1099.0s)]
*  He was just loudly transferred. Loudly transferred. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1102.0s)]
*  And that's how they dealt with it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1104.0s)]
*  Jamie, go back to that article again. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1106.0s)]
*  I want to say something when you first pulled up the with the first initial complaints because I want to scroll. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1108.0s)]
*  Yeah, right there. So they were talking about the protocols here. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1115.0s)]
*  Let me be clear. We have absolutely zero tolerance for hazing, abuse or deviations from safety protocols. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1121.0s)]
*  As Navy SEALs, we serve our fellow Americans uncompromising integrity is our standard. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1128.0s)]
*  Our character and honor are steadfast. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1132.0s)]
*  Most of all, we were expected to lead by example in all situations. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1134.0s)]
*  So if that is like standard operational procedure for those kind of training programs, why? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1137.0s)]
*  Why does he have to say that? So hazing, right? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1144.0s)]
*  It's not. I mean, you could. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1148.0s)]
*  Could you hate somebody with tear gas? Yes. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1151.0s)]
*  What I'll say is that as somebody who was a bud's instructor, there is an evolution sheet and matrix for every single thing that happens in training. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1153.0s)]
*  To include remediating the students when they fall short of a standard. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1161.0s)]
*  There are limits to how long you can remediate them for. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1165.0s)]
*  There's limits to the exercises that you can use. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1169.0s)]
*  There is an oversight matrix of who's in charge of the evolution. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1172.0s)]
*  What's the ratio going to be student to instructor? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1175.0s)]
*  There is somewhere a matrix and evolution sheet for exposure to CS gas in buds. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1178.0s)]
*  There is absolutely no way that those instructors are like, hey, hey, Mike, you doing anything tomorrow? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1186.0s)]
*  Let's go gas these fuckers like that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1191.0s)]
*  That doesn't happen every single day in Buds is templated. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1193.0s)]
*  Why that person said that, I'm not sure. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1197.0s)]
*  But as somebody who worked in that pipeline with that curriculum, it exists. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1199.0s)]
*  And what they need to say is, yeah, there's a reason that we do this. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1204.0s)]
*  And the reason that we do this is so that their first exposure isn't an environment where their life might be on the line. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1206.0s)]
*  That would actually shut it down because what that does is it leaves the door and it leaves question in people's minds. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1212.0s)]
*  Did they did they make a mistake? Were they hazing people? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1217.0s)]
*  Do we need to do this? My resounding answer is yes. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1219.0s)]
*  And also, I'll add to that my answer when people ask me about students who have died in Buds. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1222.0s)]
*  And I think there have been 10 in the history of Buds since the fifties is that it needs to continue to happen. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1227.0s)]
*  I don't want it to happen. I don't want anybody to lose their life. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1233.0s)]
*  But if the training becomes so exceedingly safe that that's not a potential, then we're not serving people in that training and we're not preparing them for what the battlefield is going to expect. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1236.0s)]
*  I'll push against you on that one. If you explain it to the American public, more than half still won't understand. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1245.0s)]
*  They will still view it as brutal, as unnecessary. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1251.0s)]
*  But, you know, there's been a push to make the military a playground for progressive policies. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1257.0s)]
*  And it is the last place politically that we want people playing. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1267.0s)]
*  And I mean, you even see China has a has an initiative to actually make their men more masculine. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1271.0s)]
*  Yes, we're going the opposite opposite direction. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1278.0s)]
*  You know, there is a diversity, equity, equity and inclusion chief at the Pentagon now who wrote a book that basically called the first responders menaces and, you know, basically painted them as as white supremacists. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1281.0s)]
*  And it's going a very bad direction. I will say this about the military. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1296.0s)]
*  What people don't understand is it is highly professional. I've always been impressed. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1303.0s)]
*  There are standards, there's doctrine and instructors know that they follow that playbook. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1307.0s)]
*  They mitigate risk to the lowest level because you always have the risk of getting investigated for something like this. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1312.0s)]
*  So who's letting these progressive policies infect the military? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1319.0s)]
*  How is that ever an option? Is that just people who are blissfully unaware because they're on the outside? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1324.0s)]
*  Like, how is that? How does that ever get in to the point where you're considering things like elite groups like the seals having to deal with this sort of politically correct nonsense? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1331.0s)]
*  Personally, I think the policy of transparency that was made or popularized by President Obama in this is I'm not attacking President Obama. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1343.0s)]
*  He was aggressive on the war on terror. He made a lot of aggressive decisions. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1353.0s)]
*  But there are certain communities where transparency like the CIA special operations is not the best policy, is they should remain in the shadows. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1358.0s)]
*  And there should be just public trust that we are doing the right things. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1367.0s)]
*  We don't want anyone to pass away in training. We don't want to get anyone hurt. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1372.0s)]
*  But we also don't want to advertise our capabilities or our training or our capacities to potential military peers like China or Russia. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1378.0s)]
*  So the transparency for me propaganda do it with the regular military. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1388.0s)]
*  Keep keep special operations doing with the regular military. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1395.0s)]
*  Like, why? I don't know. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1398.0s)]
*  I don't have an answer for how it started infiltrating other than it seems to be the groundswell. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1400.0s)]
*  I mean, the military is just a is just a group of people from normal society. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1406.0s)]
*  So I don't think it's uncommon to see things that our society is dealing with working their way into the military. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1410.0s)]
*  But I do hope that there is a backstop against it. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1416.0s)]
*  And in my mind, everything needs to be worked in a reverse direction. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1418.0s)]
*  What is it we're asking these people to do in the real world execution of their job? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1422.0s)]
*  Now, let's work our training pipeline to prepare those people for that. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1426.0s)]
*  I don't know where the progressive ideology falls into that or how it infects that or how it got started. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1429.0s)]
*  But and I'm a little bit detached from the teams at this point. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1435.0s)]
*  I've been out now for almost 10 years, but I still stay in contact with people. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1438.0s)]
*  And what I am hearing, though, is that it is pushing at the corners and it is pushing at the edges. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1441.0s)]
*  And it's not enhancing what they're doing. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1447.0s)]
*  And they're in their words, not mine, because, again, I've been out of it for almost a decade and their words, not mine. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1450.0s)]
*  It's not enhancing their ability to perform on the X. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1455.0s)]
*  But I can understand that the seals are filled with guys like you guys. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1459.0s)]
*  How does it even get how does it even get discussed? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1463.0s)]
*  There's a bell curve even in the seal teams. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1467.0s)]
*  There's you take even the command that we served at, which it's not impossible to get to. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1469.0s)]
*  It's a little bit more difficult. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1476.0s)]
*  But if you take a team of 50 people, you're going to have your bottom 10 percent and you're going to have your top 10 percent and everybody else in between. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1477.0s)]
*  And it is a melting pot. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1482.0s)]
*  I mean, I serve with people who were just devoutly religious, devoutly religious, and then people who come to find out later were sociopaths and serial killers. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1483.0s)]
*  We've talked about that on a previous podcast, but and everything in between. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1494.0s)]
*  So there is diversity of ideas inside of the seal community. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1497.0s)]
*  People think, oh, it's only people who lean to the right. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1502.0s)]
*  And I would say there are more people who lean to the right, but there are plenty who leave to the left. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1504.0s)]
*  And we're talking I mean, I remember team room conversations about religion, about politics, about sexuality. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1509.0s)]
*  And there was never like, yep, that's it. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1514.0s)]
*  And we all slapped the table. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1516.0s)]
*  So let me say, well, to this point, I wrote a book about this called The Talent War, how special operations and great organizations went on talent. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1518.0s)]
*  It was about performance and about building high performing teams and how the special operations goes about it. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1524.0s)]
*  Because when you think about it in the private sector, people hire you based on how much industry experience you usually have. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1529.0s)]
*  Well, in our profession, I can't go to a high school or a college and say, who here has special operations experience? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1536.0s)]
*  Nobody would raise their hands. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1542.0s)]
*  So by nature, the assessment and selection process, which we're talking about, basic underwater demolition school, is hire for character, train for skill. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1544.0s)]
*  And that's why we push these men and women to their limits, their mental and physical limits, because that's where true character emerges. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1552.0s)]
*  And that's what we're looking for. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1560.0s)]
*  We're looking for mental toughness, resiliency, the ability to work as a team. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1562.0s)]
*  And that brings up a point. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1566.0s)]
*  You know, one of the former commandants of the Marine Corps just wrote an article and basically was was arguing, keep your hands off the military. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1567.0s)]
*  The military runs off a different set of ideologies. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1575.0s)]
*  Those ideologies are conformity to a degree, which conformity is not always a bad thing. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1579.0s)]
*  You know, if you have a baseball team, you want some conformity to SOPs, standard operating procedures. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1585.0s)]
*  But it's also to operate as a team. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1590.0s)]
*  So in this training, we break people down in their individual selves and we build them up as a team player where the public sector sort of. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1593.0s)]
*  Let's say they they they trend towards individuality, which is not bad either. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1602.0s)]
*  We do want people to be people like Andy has a personality. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1606.0s)]
*  I have a personality and we almost breed this. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1609.0s)]
*  I like to call it the SEAL teams, a healthy disrespect for authority to push back against my. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1612.0s)]
*  I don't say my orders. I never gave orders. These are my orders. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1620.0s)]
*  I've never said that. But hey, here's my decision. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1622.0s)]
*  This is what we're going to do. It's not a good idea. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1624.0s)]
*  And I outrank Andy and he's going to come back and be like, yeah, we're not going to do that. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1627.0s)]
*  That's stupid. And this is why. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1630.0s)]
*  So he does it in a professional and tactful way. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1632.0s)]
*  But I'm sick and tired in, you know, I do place very high performing veterans into jobs. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1634.0s)]
*  That's what I do for a living. But people based off Hollywood have these bad sort of perceptions of what the military is, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1644.0s)]
*  because Paramount and Warner Brothers don't paint us in a good light. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1652.0s)]
*  We're not the Chris Kyle's. This guy and all the guys I served with were the most lethal warriors in the world. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1655.0s)]
*  I was not. I ended up there and I was proud to be part of the team. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1662.0s)]
*  I told Andy, always a bridesmaid, never a bride, meaning I was part of a good team. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1665.0s)]
*  We got we got that mission done. We got that bride married. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1670.0s)]
*  But the most lethal warriors I knew who no one will ever know in the public were kind, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1673.0s)]
*  empathetic, respectful, and they loved their fellow man. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1682.0s)]
*  And they were husbands. They were fathers. They were sons. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1686.0s)]
*  They were they were wives, daughters, mothers. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1690.0s)]
*  And when they needed to dial empathy down and do the bad part of a job, they did it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1693.0s)]
*  And they did it with with with lethality. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1699.0s)]
*  And then they dialed the empathy back up. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1703.0s)]
*  But people naturally gravitate towards Hollywood and they paint this bad pictures of veterans. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1706.0s)]
*  And I will always I mean, I came from Atherton, man. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1711.0s)]
*  It's one of the most affluent towns in America. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1714.0s)]
*  And I ended up amongst a lot of guys that came from nothing in their character far outweighs [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1717.0s)]
*  a lot of the people I know in the public sector. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1722.0s)]
*  What is it about these movies? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1725.0s)]
*  Like, why why do they paint veterans in that way? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1728.0s)]
*  And why does it permeate our culture like that? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1732.0s)]
*  You would think that depictions in fiction would not overwhelm the reality of what what is needed [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1736.0s)]
*  and what gets done. But it kind of does. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1744.0s)]
*  I think it's harder to tell the full story when you have a time compressed medium to tell that story. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1747.0s)]
*  And if you want to have people put their butts into seats and it's the last 20 plus years of sustained [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1754.0s)]
*  combat operation, you're probably going to make a movie about things exploding bullets flying over your head. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1760.0s)]
*  You might dive into a little bit of the storyline on some people's lives, but it's an easier, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1766.0s)]
*  unfortunately, story and narrative to tell than to truly unpack what it takes to live in that world for that long. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1772.0s)]
*  And that's probably the only exposure other than things like this, like a podcast where people actually get to sit down and talk. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1779.0s)]
*  The only exposure these people ever have if they don't know anyone that was in the seals or no one anyone that was Green Beret or Ranger or what have you. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1785.0s)]
*  They don't they don't know. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1793.0s)]
*  So, you know, maybe they read an article in the Times like, oh, these people are assholes. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1795.0s)]
*  This is terrible. Look what they're doing to the recruits. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1799.0s)]
*  We need to dial this down. We dial this back like I have to do at the office. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1802.0s)]
*  Like they don't have a comprehension of like what is necessary to get the job done. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1806.0s)]
*  What you guys have to do. Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1811.0s)]
*  If I could rewind the clock back to 2010, my last deployment, and you take somebody who says that the training that we were talking about is unnecessary. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1813.0s)]
*  Like, why don't you just get in my hip pocket for tonight? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1821.0s)]
*  Why don't you just come with me on target? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1824.0s)]
*  And at the end of this, we're going to do a debrief and you let me know how difficult you think the training should be so you can perform at this level in an environment that might take your life. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1826.0s)]
*  And they're going to go, OK, well, I don't know what they would say, but I would assume they would say, yeah, you guys can make this as really as hard as possible. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1834.0s)]
*  And I'm totally good with you gassing people. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1841.0s)]
*  And maybe you should gas them for longer, many more times. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1843.0s)]
*  And you should do this. It would blow their fucking mind what is actually required to be able to perform in that environment. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1845.0s)]
*  And I can't fault them for not understanding that because they just don't have exposure to it. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1851.0s)]
*  We've gotten comfortable. We've gotten way too comfortable here. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1856.0s)]
*  And if they saw the atrocities that we saw over there, they would understand why, you know, evil exists. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1859.0s)]
*  And you've heard the Ralph Wado Emerson quote, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evils for good men to stand by and do nothing. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1866.0s)]
*  And that I mean, we saw ISIS throwing gay men from seven story roofs with the people in the town watching. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1875.0s)]
*  There is evil. And unfortunately, sometimes you've got to go to hell to send somebody to hell. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1884.0s)]
*  It's a it's a famous quote. It's an ugly job. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1891.0s)]
*  I think you said it best. I watched an interview where you said war leaves a fingerprint. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1897.0s)]
*  It leaves a fingerprint in that fingerprint will always be a part of our DNA. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1902.0s)]
*  And I question some of the things we did in the outcomes of the war. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1907.0s)]
*  And I even went back as a BUDS instructor. I was I was the junior officer training course director for the SEALs that graduated BUDS. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1912.0s)]
*  And my job in one month was to turn them into ground force commanders, GFCs, as we call it. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1918.0s)]
*  And I worked a hell week evolution. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1923.0s)]
*  And when I worked it, I was the what do you call it? Not the phase officer, but the OIC for the evolution. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1926.0s)]
*  I just like the shift lead or something like that. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1932.0s)]
*  Yeah, the shift lead. And the first time I looked at the guys and I'm like, oh, my God, we're going to kill these kids. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1934.0s)]
*  And they're like, hey, hey, Mike, calm down. We thought that the first time we saw this training as well. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1939.0s)]
*  And we've all been through it. But when you go back and actually because you go through it the first time and it's so abstract because it's just day after day after day. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1943.0s)]
*  And you go back as an instructor and there's not enough instructors to in just first phase, which is where hell week occurs. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1952.0s)]
*  They augment from all the other phases because it's a 24 hour training pipeline from a Sunday till about Friday afternoon. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1958.0s)]
*  And you watch people who are on the verge of death and they're there voluntarily. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1964.0s)]
*  And even though you went through it, it you sit back like, holy shit. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1969.0s)]
*  Like, did we look that bad? I remember specifically asking other instructors like, do you think that we looked as bad as they look when we were in training? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1974.0s)]
*  Because these dudes are the walking dead. It's gnarly. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1981.0s)]
*  That's what I was just going to say. And Joe, you got to understand. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1984.0s)]
*  We've got medical personnel out there. We've got ambulances out there. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1987.0s)]
*  Sometimes you have a psychologist out there. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1991.0s)]
*  I mean, we are going through a checklist to mitigate risk down to the lowest level. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1993.0s)]
*  But the interesting thing about the assessment and selection is, you know, we used to play a game. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=1997.0s)]
*  Who's going to make it through the training? And you are 90 percent wrong. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2003.0s)]
*  I mean, we had a NCAA athlete in one of the classes of starting fullback. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2007.0s)]
*  Didn't last two weeks of though. How long is the training? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2012.0s)]
*  BUDS 26 weeks. 26 weeks. Didn't last past the second week. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2015.0s)]
*  And I even going through it because I was a prior recon Marine. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2020.0s)]
*  So I thought I knew what they were looking for. Made a judgment on some of the kids that were going through BUDS with me. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2023.0s)]
*  One of them was a little Asian kid who was sort of passive and unassuming. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2028.0s)]
*  Is he an astronaut now? Yes. And at the end of how we got looked down the line, I think we started with 250. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2034.0s)]
*  We ended up with 25. And there's this little Asian kid that weighs probably 140, 150 pounds. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2040.0s)]
*  And I'm like, huh, wow, was I wrong assessing that kid as a fellow student to him? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2045.0s)]
*  And we ended up in the same SEAL team. I watched him earn the Silver Star literally with my eyes. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2051.0s)]
*  Or he did something that he was awarded the Silver Star for. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2057.0s)]
*  Then he went back and became a Navy doctor and became an astronaut all by the age of 34. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2061.0s)]
*  And his name is Dr. Johnny Kim. And he's he's the most humble dude. Classic underachiever. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2067.0s)]
*  Yeah. So what is it when you're looking at them and they look like they're at the verge of death? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2074.0s)]
*  Like what what part of the program are they going through? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2078.0s)]
*  I would say when you're seeing them at that phase, it's going to be the trenches of Hell Week because that is literally a 24 hour long from Sunday evening [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2081.0s)]
*  somewhere between sun going down at 6 p.m. to whenever they started with breakout at 8 p.m. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2090.0s)]
*  all the way through to Friday. You're going to get about two hours of sleep on Wednesday. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2095.0s)]
*  So it's going to be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. They're they're absolute walking dead by design. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2098.0s)]
*  They're just barely getting any sleep at all. Two hours of sleep on Wednesday. That's it. That's it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2104.0s)]
*  You might get like some micro awards because everything is like a team evolution. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2108.0s)]
*  There's some really famous pictures of people running with boats on their heads. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2112.0s)]
*  And if you win an evolution, you maybe get five minutes of standing there by yourself or the instructors might let you put your boat down and they'll not pay attention to you for a little bit. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2115.0s)]
*  So you can get like a micro nap. Other than that, they're they're just moving constantly. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2124.0s)]
*  Evolution after evolution after evolution after evolution. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2129.0s)]
*  How can you stay awake that long? Hypothermic. You're constantly being told to do things. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2131.0s)]
*  I mean, the main tools that you have at Bud's is the beach. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2137.0s)]
*  You have sand, which is obviously an amazing abrasive and the cold water. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2140.0s)]
*  And like the main tools at Bud's are telephone poles, which are super low tech. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2144.0s)]
*  These IBS inflatable boats, small, which is an air filled rubber boat carried by six people on each or three on each side and an officer in the back generally. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2148.0s)]
*  Because as Mike knows from his career, they're just generally doing less than the enlisted. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2157.0s)]
*  And that's it. I mean, those are the main tools. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2164.0s)]
*  I mean, those are the main tools. So they're always they're racing, they're running, they're paddling their boats, they're crawling through the mud pits. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2166.0s)]
*  They're just constantly moving. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2173.0s)]
*  So the sleep deprivation is about testing your will or testing your ability to endure. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2174.0s)]
*  When your character and your character, I would describe. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2179.0s)]
*  And this is my description, not anything that I think the Navy would agree with. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2182.0s)]
*  I would describe Bud's training as an ability to look at who somebody really is when you're at the lowest point you ever, ever thought you've been at emotionally, physiologically, psychologically. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2187.0s)]
*  And when presented a choice, are you going to take care of yourself? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2201.0s)]
*  Are you going to take care of the people that are next to you? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2205.0s)]
*  That is what Bud's to me boils down to. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2207.0s)]
*  Make somebody cold and make somebody tired. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2210.0s)]
*  And we're talking three days without sleep. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2212.0s)]
*  I mean, when in your youth, prior to that, did you ever go three days without sleep? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2214.0s)]
*  Probably never. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2219.0s)]
*  Ever. Ever. And you see different people. You see people for who they are. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2220.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you can think somebody is hard as hard as hell, you know, at the beginning stages of Bud's and then everything changes in that one week. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2224.0s)]
*  And, you know, what we found personally, this is my anecdotal sort of learning is that people who faced a lot of obstacles early in life before getting to SEAL training [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2232.0s)]
*  usually have the scar tissue of resilience and they do pretty damn well. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2243.0s)]
*  And the thing about Bud's is you don't know anyone's story. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2248.0s)]
*  You know, when no one's I mean, yeah, you may know that Andy's from the Santa Cruz area and Mike's from Palo Alto area, but you don't know their background. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2251.0s)]
*  Point in case, Johnny Kim. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2260.0s)]
*  You know, I knew I've known Johnny for 15 years and then we finally hear on the Jocko podcast where he sort of goes into his background that his dad was killed by police. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2262.0s)]
*  And he was sort of, you know, he's the one that called the police on that day. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2272.0s)]
*  His dad had to stand off and he blames himself. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2276.0s)]
*  We never knew that about Johnny. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2279.0s)]
*  But had I known that before making an assessment of Johnny, I would have realized that that that kid at the time had been through a lot more in life than I had. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2281.0s)]
*  And there's no other way. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2291.0s)]
*  I don't think that there is. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2293.0s)]
*  How else could you know what what someone's capable of? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2295.0s)]
*  I mean, unless you really test them like that, it doesn't seem like there's another way. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2299.0s)]
*  Otherwise, you like you were saying, you don't know who they are until they're under that kind of stress. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2304.0s)]
*  And for clarity, the selection process is not perfect. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2310.0s)]
*  There are still people that make their way through. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2313.0s)]
*  I have seen people who have been fully made it through the multi-year trending pipeline, who have been awarded their tried and they've maybe even done a combat deployment. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2316.0s)]
*  I have seen them quit. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2324.0s)]
*  I have seen them give up, which is supposed to be what that training crucible is all about. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2325.0s)]
*  Finding those people that in theory would never be able or would never allow themselves to make that decision. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2331.0s)]
*  It's just not perfect, but it's as close as I think we can possibly get. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2336.0s)]
*  I have a deep respect for anyone who makes it through, but you are part of a select few. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2342.0s)]
*  But let me read like let me reshape this for you. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2348.0s)]
*  Ultimately, in the career of a SEAL or Army Special Forces or 75th Ranger Regiment, they all go through very similar training. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2351.0s)]
*  That's just the entrance exam. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2359.0s)]
*  It's a long entrance exam, and it's the longest behavioral interview probably in the world. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2362.0s)]
*  And to Andy's point, we still get it wrong, but that's the entrance exam. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2368.0s)]
*  And then the next part of your career, the next potential five years, 20 years, 30 years, it then sort of transforms into performance. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2373.0s)]
*  Can you perform? Can you do the tactical and technical side? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2384.0s)]
*  We already know you have the mental toughness, the resilience, but there's a lot of guys that graduate BUDs that just quite frankly, to his point, this talent distribution, this normal distribution, this bell curve. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2387.0s)]
*  I mean, we've got our top 2% and they're completely in a different realm. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2397.0s)]
*  And then you've got the 98% and you can split that into multiple tranches of the high performers, middle of the road performers. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2402.0s)]
*  And then we call the bottom of the barrel. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2407.0s)]
*  And when you get out of BUDs, what is the process? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2412.0s)]
*  Like once you graduate, once you're out of BUDs, what's the process from there out? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2416.0s)]
*  Trane? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2421.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a little over my skis on this one because they changed it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2422.0s)]
*  When I went through, we did a bunch. So the goal at the end of the day is to be awarded your Trident. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2425.0s)]
*  It's a metal pin that you get handed and they change your NEC or what does that mean? Naval Enlistment Classification? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2430.0s)]
*  It changed it to a 5326 for an enlisted person, which means you're a SEAL. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2435.0s)]
*  When you show up on like you're now officially a SEAL. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2440.0s)]
*  When I went through, it was BUDs, it was Static Line Jump School out at Fort Banning. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2443.0s)]
*  We checked into our team and they put us through another six months to a year of training. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2448.0s)]
*  And then you went around to all of the departments and you tested in front of your peers and you were doing calculations for a demo. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2452.0s)]
*  You were planning a dive with currents. You were taking apart weaponry. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2458.0s)]
*  I mean, you were talking about tactics and it was a very, at the time, I was like, this is unbelievable. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2462.0s)]
*  I thought it was just this robust test of knowledge. I look back now, I'm like, holy shit, those were the entry level. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2468.0s)]
*  Like those were just the chapters. I didn't understand the words that were even on the page. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2473.0s)]
*  So each team kind of did their own thing. And, you know, post 9-11, a lot of things got course corrected. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2477.0s)]
*  And I think this is one of them. They realized it's not a good idea to have SEAL Team 5, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2483.0s)]
*  which is literally a nine iron golf shot away from SEAL Team 3 doing different training. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2487.0s)]
*  Probably better if we all get the same product at the end of the day. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2491.0s)]
*  So now when you graduate BUDs, you go to a program called it's SQT, SEAL Qualification Training, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2494.0s)]
*  which is going to be like another maybe two years, depending on when you time it. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2500.0s)]
*  And you go through cold weather training, jungle training, desert training, web like everything, you know, comms, all of that stuff. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2505.0s)]
*  And at the end of that, they graduate as a class. They're all awarded their trident. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2513.0s)]
*  So they all have the same baseline level of training. And then you go to your SEAL Team. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2517.0s)]
*  So you're two years into a pipeline before you show up for your first day on the job at a SEAL Team. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2520.0s)]
*  And that's what I went through. Like broadly, like there's going to be some outliers in that. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2525.0s)]
*  But that broadly that covers what they're going to do for the pipeline. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2529.0s)]
*  So basically we were better and smarter than than his generation. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2532.0s)]
*  They knew more for sure. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2535.0s)]
*  Is it difficult to get people to is it like the same amount of people that are trying to become SEALs now as there was in the past? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2537.0s)]
*  Or is it? I would say so. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2545.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would say so, if not more. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2548.0s)]
*  It's more competitive to even get into the training. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2550.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they've got thousands of kids competing for only 250 slots per class. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2553.0s)]
*  And these kids are better athletes. They're smarter. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2558.0s)]
*  So it's it's more competitive. So the process has worked. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2561.0s)]
*  There is something to say for Hollywood and and you know, the Paramount Plus show, you know, SEAL Team, they are a funnel filler for recruitment for high performing kids coming out of high school or college that that want to give it a shot to see if they have what it takes to become a SEAL and Army Special Forces Green Beret Ranger Regiment Marsok Raider. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2564.0s)]
*  And that's the whole point. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2587.0s)]
*  The whole point is to we hope the next generation coming behind us is better, faster, stronger than than we were. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2588.0s)]
*  It's interesting you ask that, though, because in one of those articles, and I believe it was around I read it in an article was around the young man's death. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2594.0s)]
*  It was talking about the attrition rate, you know, the number of people that are making it through. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2602.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it would appear that the attrition rate or the number of people making it through is decreasing, which gives you an opportunity to look at that in two different directions. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2606.0s)]
*  I know I have my take on it and then it seemed to be a more popular take that was being talked about. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2616.0s)]
*  And the more popular take was, well, this training is too hard. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2620.0s)]
*  Why are we doing these things? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2624.0s)]
*  The way I look at it is let's assume that the training has actually been the same largely since its inception. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2626.0s)]
*  I think it was in like the 40s or 50s. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2631.0s)]
*  But when they switched from being the, you know, the UDT into the SEAL teams, if the training has actually stayed the same and we're using the same fucking telephone poll logs, I wouldn't be shocked if we were still using some of the actual same telephone poll logs. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2633.0s)]
*  From back in the day, then what is it that is actually changing? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2645.0s)]
*  And the answer is the people who are attempting the training. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2649.0s)]
*  So instead of vilifying the training, maybe we ought to take a hard look at our society and maybe the curriculum is just doing is doing just fine. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2652.0s)]
*  But as a society, we're getting softer and softer and softer with less resilience. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2659.0s)]
*  And that, to me, explains a lot more the differences in attrition than the actual curriculum itself. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2664.0s)]
*  It's hard to argue that that's not the case in terms of the people that you see today. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2671.0s)]
*  It seems like today people demand more. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2676.0s)]
*  They feel like they deserve more. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2679.0s)]
*  They feel like they're entitled to more and they feel like they want to work less. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2682.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a narrative that you see pushed over and over and over again, which is the exact opposite you want for any kind of extraordinary achievement. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2686.0s)]
*  That attitude is going to keep you from ever being extraordinary at anything. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2694.0s)]
*  If you think that the world owes you something, you think that you're entitled to something, you think that you're working too hard. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2699.0s)]
*  The people that excel in any endeavor in life are the people that are willing to work the smartest, the hardest, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2704.0s)]
*  and the people that are able to get out of their own fucking way and realize that they're task oriented. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2712.0s)]
*  They get the job done, whatever the fuck it is. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2718.0s)]
*  People that concentrate on, and this is something that's enforced in our society, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2720.0s)]
*  people that concentrate on the negative aspects of things like, why is it so hard? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2725.0s)]
*  Why is this? Why does this person have something that I don't? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2732.0s)]
*  Why do they get a chance and I don't? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2735.0s)]
*  That kind of thinking is encouraged in our culture today. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2738.0s)]
*  It's encouraged that if you didn't succeed, it's more likely that somebody fucked you over. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2742.0s)]
*  It's less likely that you're kind of fucking lazy or entitled. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2748.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to tell anybody that today. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2754.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to tell you what you're not working on. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2757.0s)]
*  Well, you'll get ganged up on by the people who are used to being told, it's not me, it's everything else externally. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2759.0s)]
*  I don't know where the end state leads to that, but I don't think it's awesome. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2763.0s)]
*  I don't think it's the place where we want to end up. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2768.0s)]
*  It's only awesome for people who don't think like that because then they excel. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2771.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2774.0s)]
*  I had this conversation with someone about Gordon Ryan, like why is Gordon Ryan so good? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2778.0s)]
*  And I said, well, one of the reasons why he's so good is he works every day. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2785.0s)]
*  It's 365 days a year. He doesn't take any days off. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2788.0s)]
*  Almost like he's dedicated his life to it. Crazy, right? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2791.0s)]
*  Who would have thunk? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2794.0s)]
*  Crazy. Everybody wants to be a bad motherfucker, but nobody wants to do what it takes to become that. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2795.0s)]
*  And therein lies the problem, I think. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2800.0s)]
*  So one, I think the next epidemic that we need to confront and confront now is victimhood. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2802.0s)]
*  It's permeating the United States rapidly. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2808.0s)]
*  But you're looking for it. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2812.0s)]
*  But you look at Gordon Ryan, everyone who looks at him on social media thinks it just came overnight. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2814.0s)]
*  Well, he just got canceled on social media. I can't believe you brought that up. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2819.0s)]
*  Yeah, what is happening with this? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2822.0s)]
*  They didn't even tell him why. They said it was bullying. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2824.0s)]
*  So he's literally in a business where elite athletes that are trained killers try to bully each other. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2828.0s)]
*  I think that's what they do. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2835.0s)]
*  And then they end up going to a mat and actually objectively working it out and then they generally high five afterwards. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2838.0s)]
*  And they fucking move on. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2842.0s)]
*  If you look at the photos of him and Andre Galvao after he strangled them, they're like hugging each other. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2843.0s)]
*  He's holding Andre's hand up. They hug. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2848.0s)]
*  I think and I heard this from somebody else that he let's be honest, Gordon gets a little wild from time to time. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2850.0s)]
*  He'll say some shit. Of course he can. Of course he does rather. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2857.0s)]
*  That's why he's who he is. I think he does think like that. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2860.0s)]
*  I think what I was told is that he essentially told someone that they should go kill himself, which again, that was told to me second or third hand. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2863.0s)]
*  But that would fall into like the bullying policy. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2871.0s)]
*  Did he tell another elite jiu-jitsu fighter that they should kill themselves? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2874.0s)]
*  I would be shocked if it wasn't another elite jiu-jitsu fighter. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2877.0s)]
*  And I'm not even positive that's what happened. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2880.0s)]
*  But to me, in my head, I'm like, OK, that would probably make sense if they were to take that. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2882.0s)]
*  How many times do we tell that to each other when you do something embarrassing? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2886.0s)]
*  I told that to you when we were out there. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2889.0s)]
*  It's maybe is it what I mean? What does that mean? Is it literal? No, it's clearly not literal. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2894.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a figure of speech. It means embarrassing. You should be embarrassed. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2901.0s)]
*  You should be embarrassed. It's like Sebastian Manasako. You should be embarrassed. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2905.0s)]
*  I mean, that's should he say that? Is that OK? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2910.0s)]
*  Fortunately, he has a backup account where he basically posted. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2913.0s)]
*  The screen was like, RIP to me. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2916.0s)]
*  But my fear is that they go after his backup account now. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2921.0s)]
*  Which is kind of fucked because I actually had a conversation with Zuckerberg about him. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2925.0s)]
*  He's like, do you like the way he talks online? I'm like, it's fun. No one's getting hurt. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2929.0s)]
*  The people that he's doing this to are also people like that. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2934.0s)]
*  Now, you could be that person who wants every martial artist to behave like a noble warrior [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2938.0s)]
*  who's out there testing their skills, respect and dignity. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2944.0s)]
*  Or you could be the guy that fucking fills up arenas because people want to come to see him. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2947.0s)]
*  That's what Floyd Mayweather is. That's what Gordon Ryan is. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2952.0s)]
*  Like the elite of the elite who talk a ton of shit. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2955.0s)]
*  And there's a psychological warfare aspect that I don't think I think non competitors don't understand that. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2958.0s)]
*  There's a thing about that guy. He gets in your fucking head. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2964.0s)]
*  When you go to sleep at night and you think about the fucking Instagram posts he made about you, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2967.0s)]
*  you're like, fuck! There's part of that. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2972.0s)]
*  What were his thoughts on the way that he communicates? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2976.0s)]
*  He doesn't like it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2979.0s)]
*  You know, Zuckerberg is a respectful martial artist. He's doing martial arts now. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2980.0s)]
*  And I think he's a nice guy. And I think he wants other people to be nice guys. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2984.0s)]
*  And he doesn't want that kind of harassment and bullying on social media networks. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2989.0s)]
*  But I think that's censorship. And I don't think censorship is ultimately good. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2993.0s)]
*  I think you have to like if people don't like the way he's behaving, you should not follow him. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=2998.0s)]
*  You should not pay attention to him. You should not support him. You should not go to see him. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3002.0s)]
*  Or if you do like it and you're like me and you don't have a problem with it at all and you think it's funny, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3006.0s)]
*  you know, you should follow him. I mean, this is not a terrible person. He's not a bad guy. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3011.0s)]
*  In fact, he's exemplary. He's a guy who's doing something that's very extraordinary. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3016.0s)]
*  He's, you know, what Goggins likes to call uncommon amongst uncommon men. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3021.0s)]
*  And that's what he is. He's he's as uncommon as you get. He's the fucking best ever. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3026.0s)]
*  Like, leave him alone. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3031.0s)]
*  It worries me, though, that, you know, obviously, Zuckerberg maybe replace him with somebody else, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3033.0s)]
*  because that guy literally could probably throw the switches at these companies. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3039.0s)]
*  But what does it matter whether or not I like the way he conducts himself online? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3043.0s)]
*  Like, I'm super appreciative of the rights that we have in this country, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3047.0s)]
*  but I've yet to come one that says you have the right not to be offended at any point in your life. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3051.0s)]
*  You should be offended at some things. It's not bad for you. You should be offended. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3055.0s)]
*  They should figure out why you're being offended. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3059.0s)]
*  Well, you also have the choice, like you said, I don't know if people know this who are on Instagram or Facebook. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3061.0s)]
*  It's really easy to click the same button that you click to follow that person and not have to deal with that. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3065.0s)]
*  You can block them and you'll never see anything they post ever again. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3070.0s)]
*  That's bullying. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3073.0s)]
*  We're now at an age where facts have feelings. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3075.0s)]
*  Facts, in fact, have feelings. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3078.0s)]
*  But there's an element of showmanship in anything you do. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3080.0s)]
*  And he understands that well. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3083.0s)]
*  Even in the SEAL teams, there was an element of showmanship. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3085.0s)]
*  If you don't know what you're doing, just look good. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3088.0s)]
*  That's one of the rules I live by. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3090.0s)]
*  I'll give, like, Jaco. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3092.0s)]
*  There's an element of Jaco that I highly respect. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3093.0s)]
*  He's got the showmanship piece down. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3096.0s)]
*  And he won a lot of fanfare because of that. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3099.0s)]
*  He does that well. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3101.0s)]
*  You know, you look at our industry, the highest performers are also the wildest variables. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3103.0s)]
*  To attain that level, to get to that level, there is an imbalance and an imbalance amongst those guys. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3110.0s)]
*  Look at MMA. Look at John Jones. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3118.0s)]
*  He's the wildest motherfucker ever. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3120.0s)]
*  And he's the best. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3122.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason why he's the greatest light heavyweight of all time. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3124.0s)]
*  He's fucking wild. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3127.0s)]
*  He's a wild dude. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3128.0s)]
*  I mean, when he was fighting Daniel Cormier and they were doing the press conference, he said, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3129.0s)]
*  I beat you when I was on coke. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3132.0s)]
*  You know how funny that is? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3136.0s)]
*  That's fucking funny, man, because that fucks with a guy. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3138.0s)]
*  When the guy's getting up in the morning and eating oats and drinking distilled water and fucking jogging up hills, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3140.0s)]
*  and this dude's doing blow, looking in the mirror as you brush your teeth, like, fuck, partying, dancing, kicks your ass. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3145.0s)]
*  Will he be back? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3153.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3155.0s)]
*  Yes, he'll be back. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3156.0s)]
*  Yeah, he'll be back as a heavyweight. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3157.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's a lot of exciting challenges for him at heavyweight. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3159.0s)]
*  I like the fact that he decided to do that. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3162.0s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3165.0s)]
*  I think he's still the best light heavyweight in the world. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3166.0s)]
*  And he can still make the weight. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3168.0s)]
*  I mean, he's not really a heavyweight. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3169.0s)]
*  He's deciding to become a heavyweight. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3171.0s)]
*  He's doing it through deadlifting and squatting and, like, serious powerlifting. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3172.0s)]
*  You know, he's put on a lot of weight. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3176.0s)]
*  He's put on, I think he's like 253 now or 255 now. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3178.0s)]
*  He's fucking, he's a big fella. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3182.0s)]
*  Still with the same gas tank? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3184.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3185.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3186.0s)]
*  I don't know how you could, honestly. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3187.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, how do you have the same gas tank? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3189.0s)]
*  You don't see heavyweights operate at the same pace that you see welterweights or lightweights. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3192.0s)]
*  There's a reason for that. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3196.0s)]
*  I don't think you can. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3197.0s)]
*  And if you look at someone like Demetrius Johnson, who's a fucking whirlwind in there, he's 125 pounds. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3198.0s)]
*  You know, you don't have a lot. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3205.0s)]
*  The demand for oxygen is very different than Francis Ngannou. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3206.0s)]
*  You don't see a guy like Ngannou that fights at that pace. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3211.0s)]
*  They literally cannot. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3214.0s)]
*  These variables need to be taken into consideration when you apply tactics and strategy and how you choose to, you know, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3215.0s)]
*  obviously he has a different amount of force in each shot. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3222.0s)]
*  And that is also the case, too. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3226.0s)]
*  I talked to Max Holloway about that once. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3228.0s)]
*  We were talking about Jose Aldo and I was asking him, like, he knew that Aldo was fading after like one or two rounds. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3230.0s)]
*  And he said, it's power. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3237.0s)]
*  He goes, those guys have more power than me. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3239.0s)]
*  He goes, they're hitting harder. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3241.0s)]
*  You know, and that shit takes up a lot of energy. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3243.0s)]
*  And he was kind of laughing about it. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3246.0s)]
*  He's like, I don't have any power, man. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3247.0s)]
*  He's like, those guys have so much more power. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3249.0s)]
*  He goes, I got to hit a guy a lot of times to take him out. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3251.0s)]
*  But these guys, these one shot guys, they're all like, that's Connor, Connor McGregor, who's got that incredible power. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3254.0s)]
*  But that power, when you throw it, that explosiveness, you're essentially sprinting, whereas other guys are running marathons. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3262.0s)]
*  You know, a guy like Max Holloway is putting that volume on you. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3268.0s)]
*  Nick Diaz puts that volume on you. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3271.0s)]
*  It's a different type of fighting. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3273.0s)]
*  I got nothing but respect for those guys. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3276.0s)]
*  How much would you have to get paid to get in an octagon? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3277.0s)]
*  A lot of money. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3282.0s)]
*  That would not last long. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3283.0s)]
*  I don't think I don't think there's a amount of money that I would do it. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3285.0s)]
*  Those guys are out of their damn minds. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3287.0s)]
*  You would do it for the right price. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3289.0s)]
*  No, I would not. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3290.0s)]
*  I like to do safe things. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3291.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3293.0s)]
*  This is the guy that has a world record for a flying squirrel suit. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3296.0s)]
*  I used to have the world record. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3298.0s)]
*  Who's got it now? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3299.0s)]
*  Does it bother you? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3300.0s)]
*  No, no, not even a little? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3301.0s)]
*  No, I was doing it to try to, I was doing it for fundraising. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3304.0s)]
*  I think it bothers you. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3308.0s)]
*  There's nothing worse than it has been. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3309.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3312.0s)]
*  Are you speaking from experience? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3313.0s)]
*  I would kill yourself. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3314.0s)]
*  I would kill yourself. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3316.0s)]
*  Oh my God, we're going to get kicked off of Spotify. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3317.0s)]
*  Luckily, Daniel Eck, the CEO of Spotify, is an MMA fan, so I don't think that's happening. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3322.0s)]
*  I have nothing but, I'm dead serious. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3328.0s)]
*  Those guys, to me, they're out of their mind. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3330.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's what they want to do. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3332.0s)]
*  They want to be that guy. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3334.0s)]
*  They want to be the top of the heap. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3335.0s)]
*  They want to be that fucking warrior standing on a pile of heads. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3336.0s)]
*  There's no other way to do it. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3339.0s)]
*  If you want to be the top dog in MMA, that's a weird desire, but a lot of people have it. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3341.0s)]
*  It's an extraordinary accomplishment to become a guy like that. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3347.0s)]
*  There's very few people that are capable of doing it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3351.0s)]
*  There's a lot of talk at MMA about fight or pay and whether they should be paid more. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3354.0s)]
*  I think they should, but I'm not a fucking businessman. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3359.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3361.0s)]
*  I don't sit down and crunch the numbers. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3362.0s)]
*  I don't understand how much it costs to run a promotion. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3364.0s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3366.0s)]
*  There's a lot of money involved. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3367.0s)]
*  Also, I know that they get paid more than boxers. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3369.0s)]
*  When we talk about boxers, you talk about elite boxers like Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3372.0s)]
*  the top of the heap guys who make a shit ton of money, and they do. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3377.0s)]
*  But the undercard fighters in those fights, they don't make shit. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3380.0s)]
*  They barely get by. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3383.0s)]
*  But that's because they don't put asses in seats. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3385.0s)]
*  There's a direct correlation between how many people are coming, they're plopping down money. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3387.0s)]
*  Oh, Volkanovsky's fighting? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3393.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3394.0s)]
*  They put that money down. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3395.0s)]
*  Why do they put that money down? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3396.0s)]
*  Because Volkanovsky's a fucking animal, and they want to see that guy perform. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3397.0s)]
*  He's being paid for what he's done. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3401.0s)]
*  And if he's not being compensated fairly at that level, that's a different conversation. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3404.0s)]
*  There's contracts, there's negotiations, there's managers. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3408.0s)]
*  There's a lot of shit involved in running a business that I'm not, that's not my world. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3411.0s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3415.0s)]
*  I don't put any thought into it. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3416.0s)]
*  So I can talk about it from respect and the way I feel about fighters, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3418.0s)]
*  I feel like they should be paid a lot of money. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3422.0s)]
*  I feel like you should be able to retire, and your body is essentially broken. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3424.0s)]
*  By the time these guys are 40 years old and they're getting out of the game, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3429.0s)]
*  their fucking knees are shot. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3431.0s)]
*  Michael Bisping has two artificial knees now. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3433.0s)]
*  He's missing an eye. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3435.0s)]
*  His one eye is dead. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3436.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a fucking hard world. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3437.0s)]
*  It's a hard world. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3440.0s)]
*  And I feel like you should be able to retire, and that should be, you're good. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3441.0s)]
*  You should have enough money in the bank, so if you don't live like an asshole, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3446.0s)]
*  you should be able to take care of yourself forever. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3449.0s)]
*  And you keep me here. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3451.0s)]
*  So the NFL has a players' union. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3453.0s)]
*  Have the MMA fighters for the different leagues created sort of fighter unions? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3455.0s)]
*  There's been discussion about the problem. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3461.0s)]
*  The difference is MMA fighters are individuals competing against other individuals. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3462.0s)]
*  It's not a team sport. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3468.0s)]
*  I could see the merit in having a structure like a union. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3470.0s)]
*  I just don't see fighters going along with it. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3475.0s)]
*  Because let's say a big fight's coming up. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3478.0s)]
*  Alex Pajera is fighting Israel Adesanya. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3482.0s)]
*  If Pajera gets injured and he can't fight Adesanya, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3486.0s)]
*  and there's a bunch of people that are saying, I want to fight, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3490.0s)]
*  and then, well, you have to get paid the same amount as Pajera. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3494.0s)]
*  This is our union dues. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3497.0s)]
*  And then someone comes along and says, listen, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3498.0s)]
*  I'll fucking take that shot for half that money [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3500.0s)]
*  because I want to be the fucking champion, and I want that opportunity. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3502.0s)]
*  You're going to get fighters that cross that line. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3505.0s)]
*  And if there's no union, that makes it easier to do. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3507.0s)]
*  Could you conceivably form a union where people would get paid the correct amount? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3510.0s)]
*  Yes, I think it could be done. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3516.0s)]
*  I don't know how to do it. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3518.0s)]
*  I don't know how it could be structured. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3519.0s)]
*  But I think there's some arguments. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3521.0s)]
*  There's some arguments that a union would be a good thing. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3523.0s)]
*  And then there's some arguments that it's better to have a group like the UFC, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3525.0s)]
*  an organization that cares deeply about the fighters and tries to compensate them fairly. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3530.0s)]
*  Do they? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3535.0s)]
*  You know, again, it's not my world. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3536.0s)]
*  This is my world. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3538.0s)]
*  I sit down. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3539.0s)]
*  I put the fucking headsets on. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3540.0s)]
*  I understand what these guys are capable of. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3541.0s)]
*  I know their history. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3543.0s)]
*  I know what they're doing. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3544.0s)]
*  I talk about what's happening during the fight. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3545.0s)]
*  I try to give honor and respect to it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3547.0s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3549.0s)]
*  Other than that, all I can say is I want them to be compensated fairly. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3551.0s)]
*  How many fights have you called at this point? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3555.0s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3557.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3558.0s)]
*  What's the wildest shit you've ever seen go on in there? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3559.0s)]
*  Broken legs. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3561.0s)]
*  A lot of KO's. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3562.0s)]
*  Like the shit on Shin? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3564.0s)]
*  Shit on Shin's are the worst because those guys are never the same again. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3565.0s)]
*  Never the same. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3568.0s)]
*  No one breaks a leg and is ever the same again. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3569.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have a hard time watching those. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3572.0s)]
*  I can only watch it once. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3574.0s)]
*  I cannot watch it when you guys start doing the slow motion replays. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3575.0s)]
*  KO's are rough, but guys have bounced back from KO's. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3579.0s)]
*  Again, Bisping, that fucking KO against Dan Henderson. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3583.0s)]
*  It was one of the worst KO's I've ever seen in my life. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3586.0s)]
*  He got flatlined and then Bisping is out cold and Henderson leaps through the air [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3588.0s)]
*  and smashes him in the face while he's unconscious. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3593.0s)]
*  He literally has... [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3596.0s)]
*  Henderson's logo is an image of him flying through the air, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3598.0s)]
*  delivering this haymaker to an unconscious Michael Bisping. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3604.0s)]
*  Find Henderson's logo. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3608.0s)]
*  This is like Henderson's fuck you to Michael Bisping. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3610.0s)]
*  He literally made a logo of him hitting Bisping when he was out cold. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3612.0s)]
*  It's a power statement. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3618.0s)]
*  That punch right there in the left corner, that's him. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3619.0s)]
*  That is him. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3622.0s)]
*  That is that. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3623.0s)]
*  That's his most historic moment, his most brutal, legendary moment. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3625.0s)]
*  Look at the one with the red coat. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3633.0s)]
*  You know how crazy that is? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3634.0s)]
*  The red coat one is hilarious. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3635.0s)]
*  But you know how brutal that is? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3637.0s)]
*  The guy's fucking logo is him delivering a flying right hand. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3639.0s)]
*  He had one of the greatest right hands in the history of the sport. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3645.0s)]
*  If you ever hugged Dan Henderson, he feels like this table. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3649.0s)]
*  He's made out of wood. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3653.0s)]
*  There are certain dudes that just have a different composition to their body. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3654.0s)]
*  I talked to his massage therapist and she was like, his fucking body is like you can't get in there. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3658.0s)]
*  She'd be like trying to massage. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3665.0s)]
*  You're not going anywhere. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3667.0s)]
*  He's so fucking dense. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3668.0s)]
*  When he would deliver a right hand, it was just preposterous. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3670.0s)]
*  He would load that fucking thing up and just always look for it, always look for it. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3673.0s)]
*  When he landed it, you're fucked. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3677.0s)]
*  He knocked out Phaidor. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3679.0s)]
*  That fucking guy is a middleweight. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3681.0s)]
*  He knocked out one of the greatest heavyweights of all time. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3683.0s)]
*  In a fight where he was in trouble, he got caught in a bad situation. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3686.0s)]
*  He was on the bottom. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3690.0s)]
*  Phaidor is cracking him and he escapes. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3691.0s)]
*  He sneaks out the side and cracks him with an uppercut and then lands a couple of follow up shots and puts him out. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3693.0s)]
*  That motherfucker could punch. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3700.0s)]
*  And imagine his logo is him flying through the air hitting an unconscious opponent. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3702.0s)]
*  It's quite the boss move for sure. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3709.0s)]
*  That is like pulling your dick out and laying it on the table. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3712.0s)]
*  And having a big old hog. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3716.0s)]
*  Big old hog. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3718.0s)]
*  Big old donkey dick. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3720.0s)]
*  Have you ever been hugged by dudes where you're just like don't ever hug me again? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3722.0s)]
*  Yeah, all the time. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3726.0s)]
*  I fucking hug all those guys. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3727.0s)]

*  Yeah, man. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3730.0s)]
*  Look, when you meet Brock Lesnar, you're like what the fuck are you? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3731.0s)]
*  I had a joke about Brock Lesnar. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3735.0s)]
*  I'm not worried that Brock Lesnar would fuck me. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3737.0s)]
*  I'm worried he would use me as a condom to fuck something way bigger. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3739.0s)]
*  Breaking into the zoo like where are we going? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3745.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3747.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3748.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3749.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3751.0s)]
*  I mean there's different kinds of humans in this world. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3752.0s)]
*  Tim feels like that. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3754.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3755.0s)]
*  Fucking to my own poor decision making was rolling around with Tim this morning for a little bit doing wrestling practice. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3756.0s)]
*  He feels exactly the same way. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3761.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a giant chimp. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3763.0s)]
*  That's how I was going to describe him. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3764.0s)]
*  He's an ape for sure. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3765.0s)]
*  He is a giant chimpanzee with a psychotic mind. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3766.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3769.0s)]
*  A beautiful human being and a great American. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3770.0s)]
*  I was going to say he's one of the kindest people I've ever met and he is so ridiculously capable and dangerous. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3771.0s)]
*  When I asked that question, that's exactly who I was thinking of. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3778.0s)]
*  Because when I moved to Austin in 2015, there was a workout going on and on it where they were raising money for some veteran charity. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3780.0s)]
*  And we had a mutual friend who basically had told Tim about me and he's in the military and he just comes up and he wraps his arms around me. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3787.0s)]
*  And I felt so uncomfortable. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3795.0s)]
*  I waited for it to end and it seemed like he was just sinking it in. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3799.0s)]
*  Almost like, hey, good to meet you. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3804.0s)]
*  I was taking a picture with him today and he was alternating between grabbing my balls and biting me on the shoulder for the picture. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3806.0s)]
*  So unprofessional. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3813.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's different kinds of humans. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3814.0s)]
*  But what am I going to do about it? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3816.0s)]
*  I'm like, Tim, please stop. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3817.0s)]
*  You're going to have to get on steroids. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3819.0s)]
*  Have you ever met Yoel Romero? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3820.0s)]
*  No. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3822.0s)]
*  Yoel Romero? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3823.0s)]
*  No. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3824.0s)]
*  That's the freak of all freaks. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3825.0s)]
*  He's the freak of all freaks. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3826.0s)]
*  And all the freak athletes that I've ever met in my life. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3827.0s)]
*  You know, I talked to Luke Rockhold about him and he's like, even when you hit that guy, he's like, he's made out of metal. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3830.0s)]
*  Like, you know, Yoel Romero is a famous story. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3835.0s)]
*  I've told it before. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3838.0s)]
*  Forgive me if you've heard this. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3839.0s)]
*  He went to a doctor because the UFC sent him to this doctor after one of his fights and because he had a fractured orbital. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3840.0s)]
*  And the doctor examines him and then calls the UFC. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3849.0s)]
*  He goes, where did you find this guy? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3853.0s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, he's fucking amazing. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3855.0s)]
*  He goes, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3857.0s)]
*  I've never seen a human like him. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3859.0s)]
*  He goes, I have been studying medicine and practicing medicine for more than 40 years. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3861.0s)]
*  He goes, I've never seen a person like this. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3867.0s)]
*  He goes, the ligaments and the tendons in his eyes are three times larger than a normal person's. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3870.0s)]
*  The structure of his face is different. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3877.0s)]
*  He had a fractured bone in his orbital. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3879.0s)]
*  He said they brought him in a few days later. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3881.0s)]
*  He goes, it's already healing. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3883.0s)]
*  As Yoel. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3885.0s)]

*  It was a beautiful thing. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3906.0s)]
*  And the way he was saying the way he was describing it, he was like, when you go to that program, he goes, you become a fucking machine. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3908.0s)]
*  You become a machine. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3915.0s)]
*  You know, the elite wrestlers get better food. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3917.0s)]
*  They eat more often. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3922.0s)]
*  And so it, you know, motivates the people below him who they're training with every day to beat them and get better. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3924.0s)]

*  And his corner did some sneaky shit and kept him on the stool. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3950.0s)]
*  What do you mean sneaky, sneaky shit where he wasn't he didn't come out at the end at the beginning of the round. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3954.0s)]

*  And, you know, it really cost him in the fight. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3974.0s)]
*  But also, you know, he fought Yoel Romero and Tim wound up losing that fight. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3977.0s)]
*  But he's got a legitimate argument that they should have stopped that fight. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3980.0s)]
*  He was not ready at the beginning of the round after, you know, Tim had him back. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3983.0s)]
*  See if you can find that because Tim had him badly hurt, rocked him. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3987.0s)]
*  And one of the worst times that Yoel had ever been rocked in a fight. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3991.0s)]
*  Like probably almost barely made it to the chair at the end of the round. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3994.0s)]
*  Barely made it. Barely made it. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3997.0s)]
*  And he got to the corner, sat down and the corner. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=3998.0s)]
*  Look, they did their fucking job just like Angelo Dundee did with Cassius Clay when he fought in England. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4002.0s)]
*  What the fuck is that guy's name? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4009.0s)]
*  The gentleman in England who caught, it's not the tip of my tongue, who caught Cassius Clay when he was young with a vicious left hook and dropped him. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4012.0s)]
*  And Angelo Dundee cut his gloves and they had to change his gloves. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4020.0s)]
*  Like, oh, his gloves are broken. We've got to get new gloves. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4023.0s)]
*  You know, it's going to take a few. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4026.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they kind of did the same sort of deal. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4027.0s)]
*  See if you can find it. Did you find it? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4030.0s)]
*  They did the same sort of deal with Yoel. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4033.0s)]
*  Yoel, they kept him sitting down and Tim's walking around going, what the fuck? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4035.0s)]
*  Like he got an extra like, I want to say 20, 30 seconds. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4039.0s)]
*  Henry Cooper is the guy with Muhammad Ali. He caught him with a left hook. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4043.0s)]
*  So here's Tim. Tim cracks him. He hits him with this uppercut and another one. Tim's got a bam. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4046.0s)]
*  Look at this. Left hand. Right hand. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4051.0s)]
*  I mean, he's got him badly hurt. Look at that. Right hand. Left hand. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4053.0s)]
*  So this is the end of the round. Goes back to his corner. Tim's got him fucked. Right? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4056.0s)]
*  Look at him. He's really bad. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4060.0s)]
*  Now, at the end of the round, the round's over and Tim's there and he's still sitting down. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4062.0s)]
*  The round's supposed to start. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4066.0s)]
*  He's still on his stool. They're wiping him off. They took all this extra time. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4068.0s)]
*  And then finally, I want to say it's a legit 20, 30 seconds later, Yoel gets up and Yoel eventually catches Tim with that right hand and finishes him. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4073.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4083.0s)]
*  And Tim lost that fight. But there's a real argument that he should have won that fight. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4084.0s)]
*  There's a real argument that they should have stopped that fight when he was not ready and getting up at the beginning of the round. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4088.0s)]
*  Because if you don't get up when you're supposed to, you're basically quitting. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4093.0s)]
*  You're saying, I'm not ready, which means you're not ready to fight, which means the fight's over. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4097.0s)]
*  God, I wish I'd gotten into this stuff. Like paying attention to this earlier. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4101.0s)]
*  I've only been watching UFC for the past few years because it now makes sense to me what the hell they're doing. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4106.0s)]
*  Dude, you got to come with me. You got to come with me and sit next to me. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4110.0s)]
*  I mean, can I have a headset and say shit that's not happening? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4113.0s)]
*  No, you can't say shit. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4117.0s)]
*  Like, he is going for an inverted fucking... [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4118.0s)]
*  You can sit there. Well, you'll know the Jiu-Jitsu. You're a brown belt. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4121.0s)]
*  Now I know. I had no appreciation for it though until I started training. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4125.0s)]
*  I actually had no interest in watching it. And this is how fucking stupid I am. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4128.0s)]
*  I'd be like, well, why doesn't the guy just stand up? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4133.0s)]
*  Why just stand up? Why are they up against the cage? That's boring. How hard is that? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4136.0s)]
*  Then you get somebody who puts their hands on you a little bit. You're like, oh, I can't stand up right now. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4142.0s)]
*  Yeah, you ain't going nowhere. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4147.0s)]
*  And I also can't get off this cage. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4148.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's a boring part of fighting that's necessary. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4150.0s)]
*  I am a big advocate of never removing people from a cage and never standing people up. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4154.0s)]
*  I think if a guy can hold you down, the round is five minutes long. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4160.0s)]
*  If he can hold you down and you can't get up, tough shit. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4163.0s)]
*  And a lot of people say, no, you got to have standups. Otherwise people just take you down and hold you down. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4166.0s)]
*  I'm like, so what? Then they take you down and hold you down. That's part of the fight. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4170.0s)]
*  It's still less boring than baseball. So shut the fuck up. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4173.0s)]
*  I think once I mean, obviously not everybody trades, but once you start training a little bit, you have an appreciation for how hard it is to actually hold down somebody your size, probably same skill level that wants to get up like the cage work. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4177.0s)]
*  It can look boring. But again, once now they understand what's going on in the fight for the underhook and the head. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4190.0s)]
*  You're like, oh shit, this is bad ass. You know, there's another argument, too, that I think they should add weapons. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4194.0s)]
*  Like there's a lot of shit that you can't do on that. Not weapons like knives. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4200.0s)]
*  Hold on. I was going to say, are we talking about the golf club? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4203.0s)]
*  I mean, knees on the ground, knees to the head, knees to the head on the ground, kicks to the head on the ground. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4206.0s)]
*  They're doing that in one FC and they're doing it in a cage. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4213.0s)]
*  And a lot of people think it shouldn't happen in a cage because there's times where you can't get away and you're trapped and someone could soccer kick you or stomp you. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4217.0s)]
*  But that's a real fight. If the problem is the cage, I think they should eliminate the cage. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4225.0s)]
*  I don't think they should eliminate those weapons because there's positions where guys go into where it appears like they're safe. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4230.0s)]
*  Like if a guy's in a turtle position and you've got like a head and arm and you're above him, there's an amazing option to knee someone in the head and stop the fight. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4236.0s)]
*  And you saw a lot of that in Pride. Like Mark Coleman stopped a lot of guys in Pride because he would get to that position. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4245.0s)]
*  You drop knees on their head because you should be able to. That's a legitimate position. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4251.0s)]
*  If you can knee someone standing and you can knee them in a clinch, why can't you knee them when they're on the ground? You should be able to. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4255.0s)]
*  It's a legitimate move. And if knees are legal, if a knee to a head is legal, why isn't it legal on the ground? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4262.0s)]
*  Why are we making it safer to fight with strikes on the ground? I don't think you should. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4269.0s)]
*  It's the same reason people are in an uproar about tear gas and training. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4274.0s)]
*  Yeah, but this is fucking cage fighting. It's like this is the last bastion of chaos in combat sports. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4278.0s)]
*  And to eliminate certain weapons, I think they eliminated some things initially in the beginning because they felt like those things were too dangerous. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4285.0s)]
*  That's the reason to this day you can't do a 12 to 6 elbow, which makes zero sense because it's not even the most strong elbow. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4292.0s)]
*  The most powerful elbow is actually an elbow where you drive down like to the side. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4299.0s)]
*  The most powerful elbow, I believe, is like this. It's not like this because this is not necessarily the best move, like kinetically. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4304.0s)]
*  I think kinetically the shoulder comes back and it's a downward elbow, probably has more force. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4313.0s)]
*  And I'd like that measured because this is still illegal in 2022. It's so dumb. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4319.0s)]
*  And the reason why it was illegal and Big John McCarthy talked about this, Big John in the early days, you know, he was a martial artist, black belt and jujitsu. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4325.0s)]
*  And he had to go and he was the referee. He had to go in front of these athletic commissions and talk to them about the sport and try to convince these people to approve it. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4332.0s)]
*  And one of the things these fucking normies, they didn't like the fact that people could break bricks on TV like on ESPN. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4339.0s)]
*  You see the karate demonstrations and like, well, we can't have that. People could break bricks like that. They could kill people. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4346.0s)]
*  So they go, OK, all right, we'll make that move illegal. OK, fine. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4352.0s)]
*  So the 12 to 6 elbow is illegal to this day and it's a remnant of ignorance. That's all it is. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4355.0s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. That's a fucking legitimate move. If you can elbow someone on the ground, why can't you do it that way? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4362.0s)]
*  You fucking most certainly should be able to do it that way. It's so dumb. Doesn't make any sense. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4368.0s)]
*  I want to see all of that. And I also want to see in the third round of Garden Rake come over the top because shit's going to get wild. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4374.0s)]
*  Well, have you seen those? The crowd can vote in a way. Yeah, they get to the crowd gets to vote on the tool. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4381.0s)]
*  It might be a pipe. This is garden rake. Fucking nine iron. Like they're probably already doing that in Russia. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4386.0s)]
*  In Russia, they're probably. Have you seen the phone booth fighting? Yes. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4392.0s)]
*  Yes. They do cars now. They buckle up. They're buckled into their seat and they start the fight while they're in a car. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4395.0s)]
*  And they have to get out of the buckle and beat the shit out of each other. They're like in a convertible. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4401.0s)]
*  I have a deep respect for how crazy Russians are. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4405.0s)]
*  I know. You know one thing I like? In America. Oh yeah, here we go. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4408.0s)]
*  They start off sitting in a fucking convertible and then they're beating the shit out of each other in a car. It's not ideal. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4414.0s)]
*  Well, it's not ideal for kickers. You basically take all the kicks out of the equation. It's such a silly way to fight though. It's really dumb. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4421.0s)]
*  The phone booth is better. There's no escape. They can barely turn around. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4429.0s)]
*  This is so silly. And if you're going to have a phone booth fight, you should definitely have head butts. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4432.0s)]
*  Like David LaDuke, he would shine in phone books. In phone booths rather. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4438.0s)]
*  Because you know David LaDuke, who's the king of Lethway, that's that bare knuckle Muay Thai style. Have you ever seen that? No. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4443.0s)]
*  They fight in Myanmar. Yeah. David LaDuke is, he's been on the podcast for, he's a fucking savage man. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4451.0s)]
*  In his style of fighting, they incorporate head butts. So he practices head butts with the mitts. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4458.0s)]
*  So his combinations involve head butts. It's like crack, one, two, bam, head butt, elbow, head butt. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4464.0s)]
*  He throws them in in technical combinations. So that would be good for him in there. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4470.0s)]
*  The head butts were a big part of Mark Coleman's early career too. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4476.0s)]
*  Because he would get guys on the ground and he would get into their guard and fucking head butt him in the face. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4480.0s)]
*  And punch him in the face. When did they? This is David. Oh no. Oh yeah, he's a fucking animal. He's breaking coconuts with his head. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4484.0s)]
*  All I can think of when I see that video, is I want to see him misjudge it and come in right under that and just hit the tree. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4492.0s)]
*  Well, he'd probably break the tree too. God. He's got a hard ass head. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4499.0s)]
*  You know what's amazing is the evolution of fighting or fight training in the military. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4502.0s)]
*  Because you came in in 96, I'm sure it was some random system. And I don't want to name names. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4506.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to think about how I could discuss this without a lawsuit against me. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4512.0s)]
*  But just say it was wildly ineffective and pitched as the solution. You'll never believe this to everything. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4516.0s)]
*  What style was it? Was it like a bullshit too? I would say. Yeah. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4522.0s)]
*  Was it like trapping hands? No. What was it? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4528.0s)]
*  We've got to be very careful here. Let's just say as the evolution of UFC, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4531.0s)]
*  took more substantial weight. People realized what was effective. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4538.0s)]
*  Oh yes. And especially, you know, actually Tim Kennedy as well probably was very influential in the military saying, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4544.0s)]
*  hey listen, this sort of mixed martial arts approach to our job in the military is absolutely applicable even to prisoner handling. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4551.0s)]
*  It actually probably saved lives. It would save lives because I've seen situations induced. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4560.0s)]
*  And I think this happens sometimes with law enforcement as well, where you reach the limit of your tools. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4566.0s)]
*  And you know as well as I do, it's, you know, if you apply too much pressure in certain places, people are going to freak the fuck out. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4571.0s)]
*  And you probably could get compliance with a lot less force if you knew what you were doing. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4578.0s)]
*  Right. And so I've seen people lose their lives because the person trying to control them switches them into a legitimate flight or fight state. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4582.0s)]
*  They think that they are going to get killed by what's happening to them. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4590.0s)]
*  So it induces a reaction from them and then they end up getting shot because the person is at the end of their tools. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4593.0s)]
*  And I don't know how it was for you. I got zero what I would call combatives or hand, I hate the term hand to hand training before I got to the East Coast. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4598.0s)]
*  And then in the shooting phase of selection in the morning, we were either getting hit in the head or doing kill house runs. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4606.0s)]
*  And then it would switch. So I'd either have a headache in the morning or I'd have a headache in the evening. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4613.0s)]
*  And it was looking again. I hadn't I have not been training long from a Jiu-Jitsu perspective, but looking back at it now and understanding more and seeing more. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4617.0s)]
*  The only way that I can describe it is it was it was nonsense, but it was being taught at the highest level because they just didn't know. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4626.0s)]
*  We didn't. Well, certain people understood. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4636.0s)]
*  Understood. But there's also you have to understand with the government contracting that each person is selling their their system. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4639.0s)]
*  And there's some politics, but it got better and better. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4646.0s)]
*  And I mean, where you were at, they were bringing in Rasputin. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4649.0s)]
*  Now there's like a Matt space dojo Rasputin full time coach. I'm sorry. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4654.0s)]
*  Where did the name Rasputin come from? The Russian guy with the big dick. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4659.0s)]
*  Dave Carrillo, I believe it is the gorilla. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4664.0s)]
*  Camarillo. Camarillo. Thank you. Full time coaches dedicated Matt. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4668.0s)]
*  So they bring them in to train. And I mean, my last troop chief was heavy combatives. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4671.0s)]
*  But dude, I always got my ass beat when we were training. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4677.0s)]
*  It's probably one of the biggest misconceptions. People like, so can you kill somebody with your pinky? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4680.0s)]
*  It's like, no, it's this one right here. But actually, I'm not left handed. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4684.0s)]
*  So it wouldn't even be that one. But it's like, no, it's like we're not in the 17 years, one month shy of 17 years that I was in. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4688.0s)]
*  It was not an emphasis. And again, I wish it had been more of an emphasis because I feel I'm so late to the curve finding jujitsu at 40. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4695.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, I see these little kids were trained today and there was a black belt rolling with an actual child. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4702.0s)]
*  And I'm sitting there like how soon until that little kid can whip my ass. That son of a bitch. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4709.0s)]
*  Well, how about the Rutole brothers? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4715.0s)]
*  Nine, ten years old, they're fucking everybody up. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4717.0s)]
*  And for clarity, full jealousy on my part that these people found it at that age because I wish that I did. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4720.0s)]
*  But it wasn't an emphasis. And people think, oh, you came from a special operations background. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4725.0s)]
*  You must be deadly. I'm like, if you give me a gun, I can hold my own. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4730.0s)]
*  But I don't want to get in a bar fight with anybody. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4733.0s)]
*  And let's step back. Some people talk about knife fighting. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4735.0s)]
*  Oh, God. There isn't a seal that I don't know that didn't cut themselves with a knife. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4738.0s)]
*  Every knife I've ever owned, I've come myself with very peculiar parts of the body as well. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4742.0s)]
*  But there is have you ever heard this story? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4748.0s)]
*  So, you know, the strength of the seals is we travel in packs. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4750.0s)]
*  And when there's 20 of you in a bar, there's a pretty good overwhelming fire superiority. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4754.0s)]
*  Pretty good probability that you're going to win whatever fight. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4758.0s)]
*  But that didn't happen in a little town called SLO, San Luis Obispo. Yeah. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4762.0s)]
*  Where Chuck Liddell. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4768.0s)]
*  So we used to train in an area in mid California. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4770.0s)]
*  And that's where we would go to have fun on the weekend when we weren't training. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4774.0s)]
*  And this story goes and Tim knew this because Tim was close and a guy named Tyson Mendea's here in Austin, which runs archetype boxing. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4779.0s)]
*  But so 20 seals were in a bar and they probably were talking a little bit of shit. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4788.0s)]
*  And the people behind the bar were part of Chuck Liddell's crew made some phone calls and some seals were laid out in the street, you know, sort of catatonic arms up just knocked out. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4792.0s)]
*  It's not good. It got banned. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4805.0s)]
*  It's seals were not allowed to go there during their time off. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4807.0s)]
*  But it was it was an embarrassment. Was it though? [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4810.0s)]
*  It should have been a reality check. Like you wrote that. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4813.0s)]
*  You wrote that check. Somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing cashed it. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4815.0s)]
*  Shut up. Yeah. Like I mean, violent altercations, let's say like 99.9 percent of the time are completely avoidable. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4818.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, just shut your fucking mouth. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4825.0s)]
*  But how often have you seen and there's some dudes that come into teams that are all about MMA and they make horrible seals. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4828.0s)]
*  Well, when the rounds start flying, being able to step into a cage does not totally translate to one when you're getting shot at. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4834.0s)]
*  But I would also say being a team guy doesn't correlate to being able to step into a cage either. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4843.0s)]
*  There might be some crossover, but they're very different things. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4847.0s)]
*  That is a good point. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4849.0s)]
*  Well, you have to treat each thing individually. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4850.0s)]
*  Just because you're really good at this one thing doesn't mean you're going to excel at the other. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4852.0s)]
*  You have to put the same amount of effort and focus into the other. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4855.0s)]
*  There's no other way around it. They're different things. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4859.0s)]
*  And then there was guys that were good at both. Yeah. Just had that mentality. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4862.0s)]
*  It's a very, very unique community, man. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4866.0s)]
*  Even like, you know, Dr. Johnny Kim is not exactly a guy who's training in fight training at all. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4868.0s)]
*  And he was exceptional in the battlefield. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4874.0s)]
*  Exceptional. And he's the his humility is is off the charts like the guy you could tell he has self-doubt, but off the charts. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4877.0s)]
*  And he's the sweetest man you'll ever meet. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4888.0s)]
*  I think you got to Harvard to get his medical degree. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4890.0s)]
*  He did. I wrote about him in my book. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4892.0s)]
*  And funny enough, and I know Johnny well, and we again came through, but went to seal team three together. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4895.0s)]
*  We're together when I wrote the book. I put a four point. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4899.0s)]
*  Oh, he got a four point. Oh, and mathematics in at the University of San Diego. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4901.0s)]
*  And he called me is like Mike. It was actually a three point nine eight. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4906.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I always had this like, Johnny, you can round that up. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4910.0s)]
*  Shut up. I rounded up. Just don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4914.0s)]
*  But, you know, by all rights, he could have returned to the SEAL teams as an officer. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4920.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. But he said, no, I want to become a doctor in the Navy. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4924.0s)]
*  The Navy needs more doctors. And he got into Harvard. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4927.0s)]
*  Is he training for a Mars mission? Oh, Jesus. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4930.0s)]
*  He's in the pipeline for a mission right now. Like he's a legit astronaut. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4933.0s)]
*  Please make him go second. Don't be the first group to go to Mars. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4938.0s)]
*  I think there's going to be a lot of mistakes made. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4942.0s)]
*  I don't know if second is safe either. If mistakes are made, that's the guy you want. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4945.0s)]
*  Freeze and run out of oxygen a million billion miles away or whatever the fuck it is. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4948.0s)]
*  Like not interested. Wouldn't be my chosen way to go if I got to choose for sure. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4952.0s)]
*  You have to have that guy on. You would love that guy on. Blown away by. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4957.0s)]
*  I live down here in Texas. Houston. Houston. Well, that is Texas. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4961.0s)]
*  It's close enough. Great geography. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4964.0s)]
*  But yeah, there's there's exceptional people in this world. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4966.0s)]
*  And, you know, the only way to find out if they're exceptional is to go through exceptional, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4969.0s)]
*  difficult scenarios and really tried and true. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4974.0s)]
*  No one's no one's just exceptional for no reason. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4977.0s)]
*  You have to do something. It's and it's hard. It's hard to do those things. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4981.0s)]
*  That's why this disparaging of elite combat groups like the SEALs is so disturbing to me. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4985.0s)]
*  It's because it's done by people who aren't exceptional and who don't understand like what's involved in something like that. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4992.0s)]
*  I'll push back against that a little bit because sometimes their criticism is correct. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=4998.0s)]
*  How so? Like what have you read that's correct? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5006.0s)]
*  It's not necessarily that what I have read in print, because what I have in my own personal experience, Mike, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5008.0s)]
*  I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on this. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5015.0s)]
*  Oftentimes in the print medium, I find that they're coming at it from an angle and they may. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5018.0s)]
*  I don't know what necessarily their motivation may be. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5024.0s)]
*  Sometimes I would even describe it as they have an axe to grind. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5026.0s)]
*  I don't know where that motivation comes from, from the axe to grind. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5029.0s)]
*  But I think that transparency from the SEAL community is not perfect. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5032.0s)]
*  And I can only speak to the SEAL community that I served in. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5038.0s)]
*  We could have done things better. We could have evolved faster early on in the war. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5041.0s)]
*  It's tough to evolve at the speed of war. Like it's very, very hard. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5047.0s)]
*  And we were behind. I think it's I don't think that criticism is a bad thing. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5050.0s)]
*  And I don't think that you have to be a SEAL to look at a program and say, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5055.0s)]
*  hey, maybe you could look at doing something like this to improve it. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5059.0s)]
*  But it should be positioned that way, not a hatchet job that's trying to hobble the legs of the community [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5063.0s)]
*  because you have an you know what I mean? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5068.0s)]
*  So it's almost as if the motivation from the person who has that criticism matters almost as much as the criticism. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5070.0s)]
*  The motivation to improve it. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5079.0s)]
*  If they have that, because some people, and that's what I'm saying, a lot of the things that I read, [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5081.0s)]
*  there's no motivation to improve it. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5084.0s)]
*  It's a motivation to chisel it away or to hobble it with an axe. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5086.0s)]
*  And I don't know. Maybe they had a terrible experience with the SEAL. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5089.0s)]
*  Guess who else has had a terrible experience with the SEAL? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5093.0s)]
*  Fucking me, Mike. Like I have wanted to kill some of the people that I worked with. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5095.0s)]
*  And I've told them that to their face. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5099.0s)]
*  And they're also with some of the best friends that I've ever had in my life. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5101.0s)]
*  It's not a perfect community. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5104.0s)]
*  Is there any perfect community? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5106.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5108.0s)]
*  But that seems to be what people forget. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5110.0s)]
*  They're like, we will pick a social media post. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5112.0s)]
*  And again, we already talked about like that video should have never existed in the first place. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5115.0s)]
*  Like do your job as an instructor. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5118.0s)]
*  Don't film the fucking students for your personal highlight reel. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5119.0s)]
*  But, you know, that training needs to exist. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5122.0s)]
*  But somebody can weaponize that and then begin to try to hobble the community as opposed to looking at it for why we do it, the reason behind it. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5127.0s)]
*  It's some of the motivations and the axes to grind. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5134.0s)]
*  They're very deep. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5138.0s)]
*  And it's just it's not helping the community. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5139.0s)]
*  It's actually hurting it. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5141.0s)]
*  And I don't know if that's what those people want. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5142.0s)]
*  I don't know if they want notoriety for writing those. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5145.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5147.0s)]
*  It's sensationalism is for every thousand things we do right for the one thing we do wrong. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5148.0s)]
*  It ends up on the front page of international news. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5153.0s)]
*  And then they focus on that one thing despite all the great things that special operations or the military has done for years. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5156.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5163.0s)]
*  It's a lack of a balanced perspective. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5164.0s)]
*  You know, so here's my perspective in the military and I don't come from the military lineage. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5167.0s)]
*  I don't think you did either. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5172.0s)]
*  Yeah, my father served during Vietnam, but mind it as well. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5176.0s)]
*  But, you know, the military at the end of the day, if you look at it in contrast to the American public, it is a leadership incubator. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5177.0s)]
*  When you go through boot camp or OCS, regardless of whatever service, it's like the greatest onboarding process there is. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5187.0s)]
*  They want you to succeed even in SEAL training. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5194.0s)]
*  If 250 kids start, the ultimate goal is 250 graduate. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5196.0s)]
*  But is that a reality? [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5200.0s)]
*  Absolutely freaking not. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5201.0s)]
*  We want as many to graduate as possible. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5203.0s)]
*  And let me be clear with the training, how people are dropped is it's a policy of called DOR, drop on request. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5205.0s)]
*  They self-select out of training. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5212.0s)]
*  Rarely do the instructors or fail standards. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5215.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5217.0s)]
*  Rarely, though, do the instructors in first phase have to have to launch people. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5218.0s)]
*  Most people predominantly are DOR. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5221.0s)]
*  And we see them out in a very professional and tactful way. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5223.0s)]
*  And we make sure, hey, what did you learn from that experience? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5226.0s)]
*  What do you want to do in the Navy? [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5229.0s)]
*  And sometimes the Navy will just let them exit out of the military. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5231.0s)]
*  But, dude, we put a precedence on leadership. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5235.0s)]
*  Even then, even though, I mean, the two organizations that wrote the manual on leadership are the Army and the Marine Corps, not the SEAL teams. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5239.0s)]
*  We copyrighted or plagiarized everything from the Marine Corps and the Army. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5246.0s)]
*  That's the more correct term. We didn't copyright shit. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5250.0s)]
*  Yeah, plagiarized. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5252.0s)]
*  We get it wrong. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5254.0s)]
*  It's an organization run by humans. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5256.0s)]
*  And, you know, the funny part is every kid that comes out of BUDS has the potential to be a great SEAL. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5259.0s)]
*  You know, the next step is who do they end up under as a mentor? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5266.0s)]
*  Because we sometimes allow bad actors to stay in the community. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5271.0s)]
*  And guess what they do? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5275.0s)]
*  They impact the young SEALs below them. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5276.0s)]
*  And the young SEALs, whatever they learn from them, believe that that is the standard and that's acceptable within the community. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5278.0s)]
*  And that leads to bad SEALs. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5284.0s)]
*  But, I mean, there was a name up there, Admiral Keith Richards. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5287.0s)]
*  That guy's a stud, man. Is he perfect? No. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5290.0s)]
*  But he's a good, good man. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5293.0s)]
*  And he's in charge of the community now, as was Wyman Howard, who just retired, who was beloved. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5295.0s)]
*  The guys would do anything for Wyman Howard. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5300.0s)]
*  And Wyman Howard wouldn't ask them to do anything illegal. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5302.0s)]
*  That would get them in any trouble whatsoever. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5306.0s)]
*  I mean, these guys are ethical leaders, but that's overlooked in the media. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5308.0s)]
*  And they just go for that one thing. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5312.0s)]
*  Well, it's almost impossible to balance the narrative, too. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5314.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, so how do you combat the video of somebody getting CS gassed on the island? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5317.0s)]
*  Do you put up 20 videos of training going exactly like what it's supposed to look like? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5322.0s)]
*  I think you should have someone come on like you that can explain why that's necessary. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5326.0s)]
*  I think that's the way to combat it. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5331.0s)]
*  I think that's the only way to combat it. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5333.0s)]
*  But it goes farther than that, too. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5335.0s)]
*  You know, there are... [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5337.0s)]
*  What has been asked of people in the military, like the execution of their normal job, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5342.0s)]
*  and I'll speak only from the special operations perspective, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5346.0s)]
*  you're operating at what I would describe the limits of the gray area oftentimes, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5349.0s)]
*  where decisions are going to be made in a super time-compressed environment. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5357.0s)]
*  Now I'm talking about like on target, super time-compressed environment [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5361.0s)]
*  with extremely limited information. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5365.0s)]
*  And mistakes get made. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5367.0s)]
*  And what I'll say is in every... [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5369.0s)]
*  I've worked with at least every military branch and probably every one of the special operations communities. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5371.0s)]
*  If you spent only your time looking into the shadows for things that if you were to measure against, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5376.0s)]
*  are these above the board or below the board, did they meet the standard? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5383.0s)]
*  And you were only looking for things that were below the board that didn't meet the standard. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5386.0s)]
*  You're going to find a lot of them. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5390.0s)]
*  A lot of those stories are written about or told, and it's hard to again balance the narrative. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5392.0s)]
*  It can make it seem as if that is the way, that is the ethos of the community. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5398.0s)]
*  This is who we are, this is who we breed, and it's almost impossible to balance it, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5402.0s)]
*  because I don't know how we talk about, you know, Neptune's spear, right? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5406.0s)]
*  The raid that killed Bin Laden. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5411.0s)]
*  Like that was very public. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5413.0s)]
*  That was a success. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5415.0s)]
*  That's a way to balance the narrative or show the success of what the U.S. military is capable of. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5416.0s)]
*  But how do you show that when you go on a deployment and you're banging out 90, 120 targets, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5422.0s)]
*  doing everything that everybody would want? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5427.0s)]
*  There's no way to... [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5429.0s)]
*  And you shouldn't talk about that. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5430.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5432.0s)]
*  It's like this negative, the negative aspect of it, which does exist. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5433.0s)]
*  I'll be the first person to say that, you know, not everything is perfect, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5436.0s)]
*  but it's impossible to balance that with, hey, look at all these things where we did, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5439.0s)]
*  because it just, you don't also don't want to share those things. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5448.0s)]
*  You know, it's a really, it's a fucked up metric system and scale. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5449.0s)]
*  What's the general attitude about people like whoever did kill Bin Laden? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5452.0s)]
*  Because I believe there's more than one person that's taking credit for it. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5457.0s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5460.0s)]
*  Who? Mike? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5462.0s)]
*  I'm proud of them all. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5464.0s)]
*  No, no, no challenge to that. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5466.0s)]
*  I think the cat was out of the bag, no matter, and you could not put that back in. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5468.0s)]
*  And how so? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5473.0s)]
*  Because of the notoriety of the mission and who they, who they took out. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5474.0s)]
*  There was, I mean, Disney tried to trademark the name of that unit. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5478.0s)]
*  I think the government stepped in and said, no, no, no, no, no, you're not doing that. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5484.0s)]
*  Disney? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5487.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5488.0s)]
*  I think I'm pretty accurate on that. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5489.0s)]
*  Is that real? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5490.0s)]
*  I think so. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5491.0s)]
*  That's gross. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5492.0s)]
*  To your point though, there are competing narratives as to what actually happened there. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5493.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5498.0s)]
*  I believe I've heard more than one narrative. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5499.0s)]
*  Correct. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5500.0s)]
*  But when people discuss that operation publicly, when they give interviews, when they write [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5501.0s)]
*  books about it, what's the general attitude in the teams about that? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5507.0s)]
*  Man, I mean, we were just out doing some training with people that were directly attached to [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5511.0s)]
*  that unit. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5519.0s)]
*  And I'm not going to say that this is the opinion of everybody, but I had some, I have [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5520.0s)]
*  some very close friends that were there that night and it's not positive. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5525.0s)]
*  And that's the most, that's the politest I can put it. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5529.0s)]
*  Is it not positive because it has a detrimental effect on the team's ability to perform similar [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5532.0s)]
*  operations? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5537.0s)]
*  Is it not positive because it goes against the ethic of what the teams are supposed to [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5538.0s)]
*  be about? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5542.0s)]
*  Like what? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5543.0s)]
*  It goes against the code. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5544.0s)]
*  Both of those? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5545.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5546.0s)]
*  And the question of legitimacy and truth. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5547.0s)]
*  So I'm trying to think about Colonel David Hackworth was the most decorated soldier in [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5551.0s)]
*  the history of the army. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5557.64s)]
*  And he said, you could have two people in a foxhole and they tell completely different [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5558.64s)]
*  stories of what happened. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5563.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5564.2s)]
*  And he said, they're both true. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5565.2s)]
*  I disagree with that. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5567.2s)]
*  They both have their own experience, but you don't get your own facts. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5568.2s)]
*  So we, Andy nor I were there and I was there in spirit. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5572.64s)]
*  In spirit. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5578.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5579.04s)]
*  We will never know. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5580.04s)]
*  And you know, that's a discussion for those guys to have. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5581.04s)]
*  And I think the fame grabbed ahold of some of them. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5583.68s)]
*  And again, I think the world of all the guys that were on that and time, I've seen this, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5588.96s)]
*  you remember the band of brothers from HBO? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5596.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5598.320000000001s)]
*  After 10 or 20 years, like those guys started to drift apart or so and so didn't like one [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5600.32s)]
*  another and that stories sort of gotten bellished or sensationalized. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5608.2s)]
*  And there was probably some animosity amongst those guys as years went on. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5612.96s)]
*  Time does not make things better. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5616.84s)]
*  And people for whatever reason, some people warp what happened in their mind. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5619.759999999999s)]
*  It's contentious to say the least inside of the community. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5624.679999999999s)]
*  So guys who get out and write books, it used to be those guys were kind of ostracized. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5629.02s)]
*  I think to a degree, some of them still are depending on the angle that you take. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5635.22s)]
*  Jack Carr, good example, mutual friend. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5638.780000000001s)]
*  He is like a 98% nonfiction writer, 2% fiction and it's beautiful because it falls into the [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5641.5s)]
*  fiction category, but it's so precise in so many ways, which is I think is what people [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5648.540000000001s)]
*  like about the books. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5653.280000000001s)]
*  There's that sense of realism. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5654.280000000001s)]
*  It's like this gun and to the point where I'll be like, Hey, Jack, man, like I like [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5655.38s)]
*  your books, but shut the fuck up about the serial number on the gun. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5660.54s)]
*  All right. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5663.14s)]
*  Like, Jesus Christ, just tell the story. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5664.14s)]
*  I love that he does that. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5665.38s)]
*  You love it because you didn't live in that world. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5666.62s)]
*  I'm bored out of my goddamn life. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5668.34s)]
*  But for someone like me who didn't live in that world, I get a better, more robust picture [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5670.34s)]
*  of what it's like. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5676.54s)]
*  But to my knowledge, he hasn't gotten any negative pushback, nor do I think he should [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5677.900000000001s)]
*  because he's not trying to write the book of, Hey, no shit, there I was. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5681.06s)]
*  It's truth layered with fiction that tells a fucking fantastic story. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5687.700000000001s)]
*  And again, opinions are going to very depend on who you talk to when it comes to people [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5694.46s)]
*  who write books. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5697.700000000001s)]
*  Jaco is another example. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5700.06s)]
*  He is writing leadership books based on his experiences, not, Hey, there I was, no shit [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5702.820000000001s)]
*  on target. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5708.820000000001s)]
*  I think where people who start flirting with some negative reactions are the ones who are [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5710.58s)]
*  like, it's all, Hey, no shit, there I was surrounded by grenade pins, surrounded by [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5716.299999999999s)]
*  grenade pins. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5720.98s)]
*  And then in their book, they start to have a very, what I will call casual relationship [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5721.98s)]
*  with the truth that has an impact for them in the community. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5725.46s)]
*  Here's my observation. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5730.78s)]
*  A lot of those guys didn't serve 20 year careers in the community. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5731.78s)]
*  You did. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5738.78s)]
*  You got medically discharged. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5739.78s)]
*  But I'm saying a lot of the guys that write those books, there I was and I single-handedly [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5740.78s)]
*  won the war, usually serve two to three combat deployments, maybe four. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5745.3s)]
*  In Jaco and Leif did a good job with extreme ownership. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5753.74s)]
*  They were trying to do something. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5756.46s)]
*  They were trying to do a, again, a knowledge transfer of what they learned that worked [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5757.46s)]
*  well leading organizations. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5761.54s)]
*  And it was the same with my book. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5764.02s)]
*  I hate the fact that it's so cliche. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5765.06s)]
*  I wrote a book, but actually the book I wrote was more about the Army Special Forces community [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5767.179999999999s)]
*  and the process they had created. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5771.5s)]
*  But when somebody writes a self-grandizing book about how great they were, that's where [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5774.46s)]
*  it goes wrong. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5782.66s)]
*  And I've got a second book coming out January 10th, The Everyday Warrior. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5783.66s)]
*  And it's a self-help book, but it's not about me nor was the first book. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5786.0199999999995s)]
*  To say guys can't write books that will benefit other people, like Dave Goggins wrote a book [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5790.78s)]
*  whether you love or hate Dave Goggins and any of the communities conflicted there too, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5797.66s)]
*  that guy has impacted a lot of lives. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5802.34s)]
*  So good on him. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5804.0599999999995s)]
*  Good on him. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5805.0599999999995s)]
*  Millions. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5806.0599999999995s)]
*  I think ultimately like, hey, people ask me, dude, you must have loved all the SEALs you [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5807.0599999999995s)]
*  served with. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5812.58s)]
*  I'm like, absolutely not. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5813.58s)]
*  It's so true. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5814.58s)]
*  Did I love them? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5815.58s)]
*  It's so true. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5816.58s)]
*  Did I love them? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5817.58s)]
*  I loved every single one, whether I liked them or not. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5819.62s)]
*  And regardless of whether we liked each other, and there's guys that didn't like me, on Monday [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5824.9800000000005s)]
*  we came together, we looked at the board and said, what's the mission? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5830.06s)]
*  We're overseas for four months. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5833.38s)]
*  What's the mission tonight? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5835.06s)]
*  We're going to operate as a team with professionalism intact. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5836.7s)]
*  We're going to accomplish a mission. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5839.82s)]
*  We're going to bring all our boys home. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5840.82s)]
*  And then at the end of the deployment, they went their way and drank with their buddies [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5842.4800000000005s)]
*  and I went my way and I drank with my buddies. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5844.62s)]
*  So I loved all my brothers. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5846.78s)]
*  And again, this is another thing that people in the private sector get wrong. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5848.66s)]
*  When I talk to companies, they ask, how did you lead? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5853.02s)]
*  I led through love, man. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5855.3s)]
*  I led through love. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5857.06s)]
*  I loved, and it took me a while to recognize this. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5858.06s)]
*  And I went through some rough time here in Austin, freshly divorced, just left the SEAL [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5860.1s)]
*  teams and it got dark. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5865.22s)]
*  And I was doing a lot of reflection. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5867.42s)]
*  And I came to realize I loved the men and women I served with, my left and right, a [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5869.04s)]
*  lot more than I hated the enemy. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5873.58s)]
*  I don't care about the enemy. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5875.1s)]
*  But if somebody was going to threaten one of my brothers or sisters, then God help me, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5876.700000000001s)]
*  I was going to step in and do whatever it took to annihilate them. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5880.58s)]
*  But it's the same thing with your kids. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5884.06s)]
*  The highest form of compassion is accountability. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5886.58s)]
*  And you've got kids, your kids do something wrong, you correct them because you want them [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5889.3s)]
*  to become competent, good human beings. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5893.24s)]
*  And that is love right there. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5895.98s)]
*  That's accountability. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5898.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's driven through your compassion for them to do your job as a father or a mentor. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5899.0199999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5905.42s)]
*  No one can argue that. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5907.1s)]
*  I mean, that's carved in stone. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5908.1s)]
*  All I would add to that is sometimes you can shit in their kit bag when they're not paying [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5915.14s)]
*  attention for the people you hate. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5918.860000000001s)]
*  Have you done that? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5919.860000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5920.860000000001s)]
*  Do I need to check my kit bag from this last round? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5921.860000000001s)]
*  No, we never served directly together. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5926.02s)]
*  If you haven't stirred somebody's coffee with your dick at least once, I mean, do you really [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5927.740000000001s)]
*  have any friends? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5931.3s)]
*  How hot is this coffee and what's wrong with your dick? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5932.3s)]
*  You can put ice cubes in it, Joe, or maybe you just rub it on the edge just to give it [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5933.860000000001s)]
*  a little dusting of pumpkin spice on the top of the latte. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5938.62s)]
*  I think that's what they were writing about when they were saying hazing. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5942.5s)]
*  I don't think that's good. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5944.78s)]
*  I'm not saying it was good. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5946.66s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm proud of it. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5947.66s)]
*  I'm just being honest. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5948.66s)]
*  I took the higher ground. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5949.66s)]
*  I took a middle path. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5950.66s)]
*  I didn't always take the higher ground. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5951.66s)]
*  I mean, if it was your birthday, watch out. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5954.66s)]
*  Don't come into work if it's your birthday. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5958.259999999999s)]
*  If you're overseas and it's your birthday, make sure you're not seen. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5959.98s)]
*  First of all, if it's your birthday and you make a big deal out of it, shut the fuck up. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5965.34s)]
*  Well, we know. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5969.02s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5970.02s)]
*  I am so tired of people on their goddamn birthdays. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5971.02s)]
*  You had one birthday. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5973.02s)]
*  You were born on a day. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5975.02s)]
*  And that's it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5977.02s)]
*  If you're like, it's my fucking, you didn't even call me on my birthday. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5978.02s)]
*  Nobody advertises their birthday. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5982.22s)]
*  Maybe some idiots do. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5983.9400000000005s)]
*  Everyone knows. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5985.660000000001s)]
*  It's a common knowledge. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5986.660000000001s)]
*  Don't advertise your birthday, but everyone knows because we have everyone's records. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5988.46s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5991.42s)]
*  That's true. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5992.42s)]
*  And calendar alerts. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5993.5s)]
*  These fields of honor shirts. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5996.02s)]
*  Folds. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5997.02s)]
*  Folds of honor. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5998.02s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=5999.02s)]
*  What is this? [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6000.02s)]
*  What's going on with that? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6001.02s)]
*  How did this start? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6002.02s)]
*  Actually, how did you and I end up getting connected? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6003.02s)]
*  I think I randomly got a call from him, which is my favorite kind of call. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6005.34s)]
*  Hey, man, do you want to do something? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6009.02s)]
*  I'm like, yes. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6010.820000000001s)]
*  Count me in without him even finishing talking. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6012.22s)]
*  I had a whole sales pitch. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6014.22s)]
*  I had a 20 minute PowerPoint presentation. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6015.22s)]
*  He's like, I just got back from skydiving into Everest. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6017.22s)]
*  Do you want? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6020.14s)]
*  I'm like, yes. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6021.14s)]
*  I'm 100% coming on the next one. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6022.14s)]
*  Which was awesome. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6023.3s)]
*  It was epic. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6024.54s)]
*  You skydived into Everest? [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6025.54s)]
*  Yeah, you should tell that first because it ties into what we're trying to do. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6026.54s)]
*  I had to take a break. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6031.06s)]
*  I retired in 2018 and my hip was bad. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6032.26s)]
*  So I got a hip resurfacing, which is basically like a hip replacement for young people. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6035.62s)]
*  Dude, I was just going through depression sitting on the couch because that is a lot [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6039.9400000000005s)]
*  worse, the recovery, than a traditional hip replacement. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6044.66s)]
*  And a buddy of mine, Fred Williams, who runs Complete Parachute Solutions, they basically [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6048.1s)]
*  train a good portion of his special operations in how to parachute. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6054.1s)]
*  And he's a former SEAL himself. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6057.46s)]
*  They equip them as well. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6059.26s)]
*  They equip them as well. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6060.26s)]
*  I was going to Everest and I'm like, hey, man, I need to get on this for my spirit and [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6061.26s)]
*  my emotional well-being. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6065.9800000000005s)]
*  And he's like, OK, this is the cost. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6066.9800000000005s)]
*  And I suck at fundraising and went and found some sponsors that didn't cover the whole [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6070.06s)]
*  thing. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6074.1s)]
*  So I had to come out of pocket. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6075.1s)]
*  And nine months to the day that I had that replacement, we were jumping into some of [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6076.14s)]
*  the highest drop zones in the world. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6080.740000000001s)]
*  So we're in a group of probably 20 people in the world that have jumped into drop zones [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6081.9400000000005s)]
*  that high. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6086.1s)]
*  And it was spiritual, to say the least. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6087.1s)]
*  That terrain makes you feel so small. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6089.820000000001s)]
*  Have you been to Nepal? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6091.9800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6093.46s)]
*  You've got to go. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6094.46s)]
*  Just even if you hike the trail, it makes you feel so small in a good way. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6095.46s)]
*  It's almost like a wake-up call. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6099.64s)]
*  Like I need to do more as a human being. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6101.22s)]
*  And so I created sort of this proof of concept called Legacy Expeditions because I believe [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6103.74s)]
*  our fallen, who I will speak volumes about. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6111.099999999999s)]
*  In fact, I got a book for you that's coming out in November about Michael Monsoor, who [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6113.34s)]
*  was a SEAL who was awarded posthumously the Medal of Honor for jumping on a grenade and [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6118.9s)]
*  saving two SEALs. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6123.9s)]
*  The SEAL 2 is right. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6125.42s)]
*  3 feet 2 is right. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6126.42s)]
*  Is that their legacies die the second we stop telling their stories. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6129.24s)]
*  And additionally, I also raised 200,000 for the kids of Extortion 17. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6133.679999999999s)]
*  Extortion 17 was the largest loss of life, single incident loss of life in Afghanistan. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6140.5599999999995s)]
*  31 Americans were killed. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6145.599999999999s)]
*  Most of them were SEALs and they were our former teammates. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6147.679999999999s)]
*  And so I think something like 25 kids were left without their fathers. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6151.96s)]
*  And so even though their families get a $400,000 check, I think that's after or before taxes, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6155.76s)]
*  that money doesn't last long. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6162.16s)]
*  Kerry Mills is a good example. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6163.4800000000005s)]
*  She lost Matt Mills, who was freaking awesome. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6165.18s)]
*  How does it stop for a second? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6168.24s)]
*  Why do they have to pay taxes on that? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6170.16s)]
*  I don't think they do. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6171.92s)]
*  I believe the death benefit is tax free. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6172.92s)]
*  And if it's not whoever wrote that, fuck you. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6175.280000000001s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6177.76s)]
*  Every penny of that needs to be taxed. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6178.76s)]
*  I don't think it's taxed. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6180.2s)]
*  I agree. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6181.2s)]
*  I could be wrong. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6182.2s)]
*  There is a lump sum benefit upon the death of an active duty service member. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6183.639999999999s)]
*  I think the number can vary depending on what insurance you choose when you first join. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6190.12s)]
*  So that's like the Navy Mutual Aid Association. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6194.679999999999s)]
*  If you've been paying for that, yes, that's a separate death benefit, but that's you elect [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6197.88s)]
*  to pay for that over the time. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6202.32s)]
*  And I could be wrong. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6204.76s)]
*  But it's like retirement. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6206.139999999999s)]
*  Why is your retirement for military tax? [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6207.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6209.5599999999995s)]
*  Disability is not. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6210.5599999999995s)]
*  I get that. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6211.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't think military retirement. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6212.92s)]
*  That's a whole different subject. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6213.92s)]
*  But Kerry Mills was on a Saturday morning, she got a knock on the door and her son, Cash [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6214.92s)]
*  Mills was 18 months old. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6222.64s)]
*  Can't remember his father. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6224.64s)]
*  And all of a sudden she's on her own with an 18 month old. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6225.64s)]
*  And so that 400,000 doesn't go far. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6228.68s)]
*  So one of the things beyond honoring their legacy and keeping their stories alive is [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6232.160000000001s)]
*  honor their memory, educate their legacy. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6237.240000000001s)]
*  We raise, and with this, what we have coming up, 777 Expedition, which has never been done, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6240.879999999999s)]
*  seven continents, seven skydives, seven days, folds of honor, educates the spouses and children [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6246.5199999999995s)]
*  of disabled and deceased military service members, as well as first responders. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6253.96s)]
*  And so we're trying to raise that seven million to give scholarships to those kids to go to [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6260.16s)]
*  college, to go to trade school, things along those lines. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6264.48s)]
*  But Andy and I, you know, man, I'm just so bored. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6268.08s)]
*  I have fun with my job, leadership development and executive search, but there is just, you [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6270.88s)]
*  miss that thrill. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6275.68s)]
*  And that's why I called Andy, who had also raised money for the Seal Foundation on his [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6277.04s)]
*  record attempt. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6281.16s)]
*  Which is actually how you and I met. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6282.16s)]
*  No kidding. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6283.16s)]
*  With Tate. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6284.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6285.16s)]
*  It's really hard to figure out what to do with any skill that you learn from our previous [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6286.16s)]
*  job that has any application in the outside world. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6293.66s)]
*  The leadership stuff, I totally understand that. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6296.86s)]
*  But if you look at the vast majority of the rote training that we did, I don't know, what [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6298.78s)]
*  the fuck am I going to do with that? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6303.82s)]
*  You know, outside of the military. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6305.5s)]
*  You could apply to law enforcement for sure, some contracting. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6306.9s)]
*  For me, that never seemed appealing. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6310.42s)]
*  So I took a 17-year chunk of my life. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6312.5s)]
*  One of the things that I absolutely have loved, though, since I started doing was skydiving. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6315.62s)]
*  And so it's not even a useful skill. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6319.66s)]
*  I think it's been used a half a dozen times for real or something like that. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6324.42s)]
*  Maybe more. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6326.9400000000005s)]
*  But the reason they don't use it in large group nighttime insertions is dangerous as [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6327.9400000000005s)]
*  shit. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6331.9400000000005s)]
*  People get hurt all the time. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6332.9400000000005s)]
*  But it's something that I learned from my past that I still can enjoy today, which is [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6335.5s)]
*  a singularly useless hobby, unless you can get people to pay attention to it and then [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6340.3s)]
*  use that attention to try to educate them on organizations like Folds of Honor. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6346.66s)]
*  I mean, it sucks. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6351.26s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6352.34s)]
*  I mean, is that brass or copper? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6353.34s)]
*  I know it changes your skin green. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6355.18s)]
*  But like, I don't know how many people... [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6356.58s)]
*  I have so many of those, but I never chose to wear them that much. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6361.3s)]
*  And those are the names of people left behind. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6364.860000000001s)]
*  And all of the people that we served with and we worked with, it's so easy to look at [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6368.22s)]
*  the guy who's kitted up, who's boarding the helicopter, and think that that's the only [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6372.54s)]
*  person that's impacted with the death or that person, when they get on target, the only [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6378.06s)]
*  reason they're successful is because of the training that they went through. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6384.3s)]
*  And then from my own personal experience, that's not the case. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6387.46s)]
*  It's a support network of your extended family. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6389.740000000001s)]
*  It's a support network if you're married, your significant other, who are playing pick [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6392.580000000001s)]
*  up basketball when you are on the other side of the earth in limited communication, doing [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6397.740000000001s)]
*  shit that's really dangerous. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6402.620000000001s)]
*  And then if you don't come back, at least from what I've seen, the military does a good [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6404.26s)]
*  job for a short period of time, but the military's job is to be forward thinking, not looking [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6409.58s)]
*  in the rear view mirror. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6415.1s)]
*  So eventually, the wheel continues to move on. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6416.1s)]
*  And I can't think of a better way to, A, honor the people that we served with, but B, continue [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6418.900000000001s)]
*  to pass their legacy along by elevating what their kids are capable of doing through education. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6424.06s)]
*  So that's... [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6429.74s)]
*  When he explained that to me, basically what he said was, hey, do you want to go do this [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6430.74s)]
*  jump? [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6433.1s)]
*  And then he told me all this other stuff later. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6434.1s)]
*  I was in on the jump. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6435.22s)]
*  But conceptually, it's a good tie for me, and I would say probably for you and everybody [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6436.22s)]
*  else that's involved. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6440.38s)]
*  It dips a toe back into our old world. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6441.660000000001s)]
*  Like we're planning. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6444.58s)]
*  It's going to be logistically very challenging. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6445.58s)]
*  It's going to suck. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6446.58s)]
*  I mean, we're going to fly economy, try to get all over the world in seven days with [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6447.58s)]
*  the skydive in between, going through customs and all this stuff, sleeping in hotels. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6450.9800000000005s)]
*  But that's kind of the shit that we used to do. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6455.14s)]
*  I really enjoyed the hardship of the job. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6456.58s)]
*  The skydive, easiest part for sure, except for Mike. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6458.9800000000005s)]
*  He's kind of trash in the air. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6461.620000000001s)]
*  I have plenty of videos to support this. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6463.14s)]
*  I love putting them up on Instagram. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6464.14s)]
*  Trash in the air. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6466.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, fuck yeah. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6467.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't think I've ever heard that expression. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6468.0199999999995s)]
*  But he's half the words. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6469.0199999999995s)]
*  This is... [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6470.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6471.0199999999995s)]
*  Thanks, bud. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6472.0199999999995s)]
*  What's the other part? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6473.0199999999995s)]
*  Trash? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6474.0199999999995s)]
*  Because that's what you're just kind of... [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6475.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a great tie in. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6476.0199999999995s)]
*  And even already in the training, we did a week of training out in Arizona just getting [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6478.38s)]
*  ready for it. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6482.62s)]
*  It reconnects you back with people you haven't seen in a decade. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6483.62s)]
*  And then everybody gets online because it's for a focus. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6485.94s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I find it to be cathartic for me, but super helpful for people [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6488.14s)]
*  who are left behind. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6492.9800000000005s)]
*  Because I'm telling you, what Mike said is correct. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6493.9800000000005s)]
*  When you stop talking about these people, that sucks that their legacy is gone, but [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6496.46s)]
*  their families are still... [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6501.02s)]
*  I can't imagine having a child who is 18 months old who never knew their father. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6502.14s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6507.62s)]
*  So this is why we've named this organization. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6509.54s)]
*  We're fundraising on this one for Folds of Honor, but our organization is Legacy Expeditions. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6512.780000000001s)]
*  And where Andy and I want to take this is set up these type of expeditions. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6518.299999999999s)]
*  Because when I went to Everest, a buddy of ours called me. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6522.9s)]
*  He was like, hey, man... [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6525.98s)]
*  And we were leaving in two weeks. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6528.179999999999s)]
*  He's like, hey, I need this right now. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6529.46s)]
*  How can I get on this? [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6531.259999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6533.0599999999995s)]
*  First off, it costs this much. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6536.0599999999995s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, there's no way I can afford that. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6537.5s)]
*  But there have been multiple guys that reached out like, hey, how do I get involved in this? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6541.0599999999995s)]
*  So we want to set up expeditions where we're taking veterans for that spiritual experience. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6545.26s)]
*  But you're right. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6549.820000000001s)]
*  You know where the spiritual part comes in is when I'm surrounded by these guys again, [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6551.7s)]
*  there is like this camaraderie, this homecoming and belonging. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6556.06s)]
*  And whether some of the guys didn't know each other, they start making fun of each other [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6559.46s)]
*  and it's just like you're back with the tribe. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6563.38s)]
*  You're back with the boys. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6565.22s)]
*  And then we also want to train veterans who have never jumped, even amputees, the gift [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6566.740000000001s)]
*  of flight and get them trained up and dedicate a parachute to them so that whether they live [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6571.14s)]
*  in Omaha, Austin, L.A., they can go on their own. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6576.22s)]
*  They've got an outlet to just, as we say, air it out. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6579.9800000000005s)]
*  Because I mean, when you're jumping from 13000 feet, it is the best view in the world. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6582.860000000001s)]
*  You put terrain around that like Everest or where we're starting out in Antarctica. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6587.02s)]
*  That is it's ridiculous. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6592.42s)]
*  I'm not looking forward to that one. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6594.18s)]
*  The high yesterday was negative 36. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6595.22s)]
*  And I want to correct you. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6597.1s)]
*  There will be no hotels. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6598.14s)]
*  There will be zero hotels. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6599.54s)]
*  Like, like purposely, we're making these guys sleep on the ground. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6600.86s)]
*  If they have to sleep on the ground, it's in the airport waiting for the next flight. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6603.82s)]
*  You want to sleep on the ground in Antarctica? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6607.02s)]
*  I think they have lodging arranged there because you would be DED dead. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6609.02s)]
*  But but literally, I was looking at the temperature the other day. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6612.3s)]
*  It's negative 36, the high. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6616.98s)]
*  So they have this pretty robust gear. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6619.58s)]
*  Like, you can't even jump a helmet that moves up and down the visor because that's likely [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6621.26s)]
*  all going to fail given the extreme temperature. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6627.02s)]
*  And I was asking him, I didn't know this. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6629.26s)]
*  Like, hey, how high are we going to jump out in Antarctica? [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6631.26s)]
*  I'm totally fine getting out at 2000 feet and getting on the ground into a sleeping [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6633.18s)]
*  bag as fast as possible. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6636.860000000001s)]
*  So call you a 13,000 feet. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6638.38s)]
*  Subtract two degrees, if not three for every thousand feet you go up in the air. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6640.62s)]
*  So what is 13,000 feet like? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6645.42s)]
*  What is it? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6647.58s)]
*  It'll be colder than when I did that negative 30. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6648.58s)]
*  Negative 30. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6651.1s)]
*  Well, the time of year we're going to be there negative 30 to negative 50 Fahrenheit. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6652.1s)]
*  For how long? [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6655.22s)]
*  How long is the go from 13 to be a minute? [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6656.22s)]
*  So if they do what I want to do, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6660.1s)]
*  our chair is outfitting the guys with a pretty good load. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6662.1s)]
*  Even if you have a good load out for cold weather, there's nothing to, I mean, you're [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6665.9800000000005s)]
*  still feeling the elements. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6671.42s)]
*  Which is why I want to get out of 2000 feet and get in a sleeping bag. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6673.46s)]
*  That's total cuck move. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6675.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm fine. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6678.14s)]
*  I'll be a warmest cuck you've ever seen. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6679.14s)]
*  It's a psych. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6680.66s)]
*  Are you guys, so you're dropping down and then you're just going to set up a camp once [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6681.66s)]
*  you hit the ground? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6685.3s)]
*  No, so there is an established. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6686.3s)]
*  It's well established. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6687.3s)]
*  Union. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6688.42s)]
*  So we'll start at Union Glacier Camp. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6689.42s)]
*  In fact, we've got to fly out to Punta Arenas, Chile on December 30th. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6691.1s)]
*  So the whole group and there's 11 of us plus a film crew and I'll get to that. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6696.54s)]
*  Even Eric Prince, the former SEAL, founder of Blackwater, he's on it. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6701.78s)]
*  Jericho Denman, 15 combat deployments with the 75th Ranger Regiment. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6706.34s)]
*  Logan Stark and Marine Stark. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6710.9400000000005s)]
*  Both those guys are from Black rifle. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6711.9400000000005s)]
*  We even have a 73 year old. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6714.14s)]
*  The guy we're going to jump him in, a guy named Nick who's helped set this up, is going [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6716.58s)]
*  to tandem him in. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6723.82s)]
*  But this guy has set multiple records since he was 70. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6725.099999999999s)]
*  And I hope I'm doing the cool shit he's doing when I'm that age. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6728.82s)]
*  But Union Glacier Camp is an established camp. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6732.58s)]
*  We'll jump there, move on to Santiago, where we're going to jump with the Chilean special [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6734.98s)]
*  operations. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6739.86s)]
*  Barcelona, Spain, Egypt, on to UAE, where we're also going to jump with the UAE special [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6741.34s)]
*  operations because they lost a lot of guys in Yemen. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6747.38s)]
*  On to Perth, Australia, where we'll probably jump with Australia and SAS. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6750.82s)]
*  And then from there to Tampa, Florida for the final jump. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6755.06s)]
*  But the film crew led by Dan Myrick, you remember the Blair Witch Project? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6759.34s)]
*  That's Dan Myrick. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6765.02s)]
*  And that guy broke all the indie records and that will probably never be touched. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6766.02s)]
*  And he's been awesome. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6770.06s)]
*  And Christian Kremple, we're close and we're going to be doing more work with them as we [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6771.22s)]
*  expand this. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6775.26s)]
*  My only ask is that Dan doesn't make it weird. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6776.740000000001s)]
*  Like Blair Witch? [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6781.26s)]
*  Like Blair Witch, yeah. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6782.26s)]
*  Like, is he filming this? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6783.26s)]
*  He's filming this. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6784.780000000001s)]
*  How can he make it? [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6785.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, what is he going to do? [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6786.780000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6788.820000000001s)]
*  Get inside your sleeping bag with you? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6789.820000000001s)]
*  Anyway, my head's going in a million different directions right now. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6790.820000000001s)]
*  Yetis shit. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6793.34s)]
*  He's done it before. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6794.34s)]
*  He created a genre of horror films. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6796.780000000001s)]
*  Well, there's one thing to do the jumps, which will be cool, but actually capturing everything [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6799.18s)]
*  that goes into it. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6803.58s)]
*  I think it's way harder. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6804.58s)]
*  Actually, the jumping, in my opinion, we haven't done this yet, is the easiest part. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6805.58s)]
*  Like, oh, OK, gravity works. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6810.5s)]
*  Checked it many times. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6811.98s)]
*  Get out of the DZ, land on the DZ. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6813.38s)]
*  But then everything else that goes in between weather, aircraft, like that's actually the [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6815.62s)]
*  hard part. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6819.54s)]
*  And then there's each other. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6820.54s)]
*  I mean, when you're with each other in close quarters for seven days, we're going to kill [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6821.54s)]
*  each other at times. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6826.46s)]
*  So we're going to fuck each other with each other during when other people are sleeping. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6828.46s)]
*  The shenanigans are going to be off the roof. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6832.3s)]
*  And are you guys doing this for a documentary? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6836.5s)]
*  There will be one associated with that. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6839.02s)]
*  I think that'll I don't I've never made a documentary. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6840.86s)]
*  I do know that it takes time to do that. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6843.74s)]
*  The whole purpose of it, though, is, again, like I said, kind of like the first time I [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6845.9s)]
*  met you to get eyeballs on something. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6849.18s)]
*  I will tell you everything I've ever done in my life up to and including combat operations. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6851.46s)]
*  Raising money is by far the hardest thing. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6857.5s)]
*  It is unbelievably hard to separate somebody a dollar from their wallet. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6859.86s)]
*  And it should be, especially in the economic times right now. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6864.7s)]
*  So it's a challenge. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6867.46s)]
*  I mean, I think seven million dollars is a super lofty goal. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6869.66s)]
*  Is it possible? Yes. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6872.82s)]
*  Is it probable? [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6873.82s)]
*  I don't know if I would necessarily say yes. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6875.14s)]
*  But that's the whole point is to do something like this. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6877.9800000000005s)]
*  Like everything, the hardships around it is exactly what I love. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6880.34s)]
*  But at this point, I just want to be able to pass on and do things for other people [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6884.5s)]
*  who gave far more than I did. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6891.66s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's impossible to describe the impact that it has when people get the [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6893.34s)]
*  literal knock on the door, which is still how they do it. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6898.5s)]
*  Yeah, and it's yeah. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6902.3s)]
*  So seven million dollars would be fourteen hundred five thousand dollars scholarships. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6903.74s)]
*  And that's not only military families, that's first responders as well. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6909.58s)]
*  And I mean, Andy has raised money for special operations organizations. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6914.18s)]
*  I have it's you know, do the one thing we can do when we come back and there is, you [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6918.700000000001s)]
*  know, people talk about PTSD and that is a real thing. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6923.9800000000005s)]
*  And some people deal with combat differently for one. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6927.62s)]
*  For some people, one combat deployment fills their cup for other people. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6932.42s)]
*  I mean, we've got we've got buddy one buddy with 22 combat deployments. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6935.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like like the guy had no life outside of his adult life. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6940.58s)]
*  And there's a whole conversation around that. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6944.34s)]
*  And I ask a lot of guys that I have served with whether or not they should limit combat [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6946.3s)]
*  exposure to people. The service member would always push up against it. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6949.3s)]
*  Yeah. But if you look at the actual long term health of the individual and what does the [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6952.38s)]
*  rest of their life actually look like after that? [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6956.06s)]
*  I think it's it's worthy of at least a conversation. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6958.660000000001s)]
*  But there is an element of survivor's guilt when you come home and the boys you were with [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6961.14s)]
*  didn't. And I think that that sits with us and that will always sit with us to your [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6964.9400000000005s)]
*  comment about that fingerprint on your soul. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6969.58s)]
*  But seven million is a lot of money and we're offering one tandem seat to somebody who [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6971.82s)]
*  will pay one million dollars. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6976.82s)]
*  And we've had some some interest there. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6978.0599999999995s)]
*  And that alone will fund, you know, like 200 scholarships. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6980.54s)]
*  So and if somebody wants to donate to this, is there a website they can go to? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6986.34s)]
*  There is. So it is triple seven. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6990.179999999999s)]
*  The word triple the number seven dot gives smart dot com or text triple seven to smart [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=6993.259999999999s)]
*  the word smart in the donation link will pop up. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7001.1s)]
*  But yeah, I'm the one that looks really good in free fall. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7005.660000000001s)]
*  So you see those people who are actually oriented correctly up top, Joe. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7010.34s)]
*  That's how you know it's not actually Mike. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7012.860000000001s)]
*  I'll show you some videos that I have on my phone after. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7015.26s)]
*  What is the difference between someone who's good at it and bad at it? [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7017.22s)]
*  These videos will clearly display this. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7019.9800000000005s)]
*  And I put them on Instagram and I tag him in it, too. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7021.9400000000005s)]
*  It's fantastic. First off, I'm inverted. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7024.38s)]
*  I'm inverted. Not by choice. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7026.660000000001s)]
*  Not by choice. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7029.259999999999s)]
*  And that's the thing, too, is is I can fall safely. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7031.74s)]
*  But our guys are what we're training them to be very good at is to land on very small disease. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7035.7s)]
*  So can't be control and can find easy skills is what we trained on. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7040.139999999999s)]
*  And we'll have another training camp December 5th to the 8th in Arizona. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7044.099999999999s)]
*  Here's a video of. Yeah. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7047.66s)]
*  Um, I'm going to try to go. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7049.46s)]
*  I'm going to try to go to Everest with him next year and take Leah for a tandem [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7050.94s)]
*  at the base of Everest. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7053.9s)]
*  I think it'd be pretty awesome. Tough to beat, though, is the problem. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7055.299999999999s)]
*  Now I got to bring Jordan. Good job. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7057.26s)]
*  Wow. And Dave Bautista [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7061.02s)]
*  is also assisting with this. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7063.62s)]
*  To support the cause. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7067.66s)]
*  And so why did you choose to parachute into Everest? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7069.9800000000005s)]
*  It seemed like the biggest challenge. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7075.22s)]
*  And I mean, so the canopy, because of the the air density at that elevation, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7079.26s)]
*  your canopy is screaming, screaming. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7085.38s)]
*  And so we went through training for a week in Leadville, Colorado, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7088.7s)]
*  which is the highest. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7091.74s)]
*  I say screaming. What do you mean? [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7092.42s)]
*  Just the speed. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7093.66s)]
*  Hi. It's high, high speed. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7094.74s)]
*  High because the air is very thin. Yes. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7096.62s)]
*  And so this is me and Andy in Iceland, which I've never seen a grown man cry [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7100.98s)]
*  after Andy yelled at him. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7106.58s)]
*  Andy yelled at somebody. Oh, Andy's got that video. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7108.78s)]
*  About once every 10 years, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7111.82s)]
*  I will have a moment where I fall short of who I want to be, Joe. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7114.26s)]
*  And that occurred in Iceland. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7117.82s)]
*  I had some choice words for it was all based around safety, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7120.14s)]
*  not my safety or my safety. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7123.62s)]
*  I mean, jumping in austere locations is something that I've done [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7124.98s)]
*  for a really long time, and I helped write the book on how to do it. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7127.5s)]
*  But it got it got to a point where I yeah, the cup boiled over [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7132.62s)]
*  or the kettle boiled over a little bit, and I forgot my GoPro was on. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7136.5s)]
*  So they got a good laugh about it at dinner. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7139.62s)]
*  The guy he yelled at, it wasn't his fault. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7142.98s)]
*  He was a nice guy. He had a good heart. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7144.9s)]
*  I didn't yell. I had pointed in choice. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7146.62s)]
*  Yes. It was almost like you yelled at a special needs kid. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7148.58s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it was a good one. Yeah. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7151.7s)]
*  What was the problem? What did he do? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7154.22s)]
*  What did he done wrong? Oh, Andy, go ahead. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7155.7s)]
*  Is there time for a bathroom break? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7161.38s)]
*  Yeah. Do you need to pee? Yeah. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7163.14s)]
*  Go ahead. Yeah, I can talk to you. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7164.26s)]
*  Trying to think about the best way to describe it. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7166.78s)]
*  We were in a situation [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7170.14s)]
*  where experience matters in anything, right? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7174.22s)]
*  Like, would you ever throw somebody in the cage on their first day? [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7176.54s)]
*  No. Be unreasonable, right? [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7180.38s)]
*  So skydiving is the same thing. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7182.5s)]
*  Most people do their entire skydiving journey at an airport, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7183.7s)]
*  which is really linear, like this table, the plane skydiving San Diego [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7186.78s)]
*  in skin in San Diego is a perfect example. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7190.54s)]
*  The plane takes off to the west. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7193.0599999999995s)]
*  It always comes back towards the mountains. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7194.46s)]
*  And most days, depending on the wind, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7196.78s)]
*  it is going to be going back towards the west. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7198.38s)]
*  And it looks the same. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7200.02s)]
*  You land the same landing pattern is the same. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7201.3s)]
*  People still get hurt in that. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7203.9400000000005s)]
*  There was a group, a large group of people who paid a substantial amount [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7206.02s)]
*  of money to go to Iceland. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7209.82s)]
*  And it was pretty readily apparent that the [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7211.78s)]
*  the net, if you will, the safety net that existed [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7215.78s)]
*  was nonexistent or barely there for things, you know, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7219.78s)]
*  and an inability, inability to talk to an aircraft, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7222.9800000000005s)]
*  an inability to talk to the jumpers once they were on the ground. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7225.3s)]
*  Varying levels of experience from low hundreds, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7230.18s)]
*  like low one hundred jumps up into, I think, one of the guy there [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7233.22s)]
*  had like twenty thousand jumps. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7236.74s)]
*  And I have been around enough people and have done enough jumping [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7238.7s)]
*  and watch people getting hurt that again, I wasn't worried about my safety [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7243.3s)]
*  and I wasn't worried about Mike's safety because I knew my background. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7247.1s)]
*  But after watching what happened the first day [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7250.74s)]
*  and then somebody getting hurt on the first jump of the second day [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7253.7s)]
*  and then some stuff that transpired in an aircraft. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7257.26s)]
*  And we jumped into a location where the altimeter settings were incorrect [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7260.26s)]
*  based off the information. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7264.14s)]
*  So I got to the ground and my altimeter read negative seven hundred and fifty feet. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7265.38s)]
*  Not awesome. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7270.58s)]
*  How does that happen? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7272.86s)]
*  They tell you to set it improperly on the ground. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7274.14s)]
*  So sometimes you will take off from an altitude that is above or below [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7276.5s)]
*  where you're going to land. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7279.86s)]
*  And you need to set your altimeter for where you're going to land, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7281.0199999999995s)]
*  not for where you're going to take off. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7283.54s)]
*  And are you doing this with like a wrist computer? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7285.0199999999995s)]
*  It can be digital or it can be analog, but either way, it has to be set correctly. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7287.419999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, what you're looking at, whether it's analog or digital, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7290.94s)]
*  is not going to be giving you the correct information. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7294.66s)]
*  So the first jump or the second jump of the second day, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7296.78s)]
*  we were told by the person running our aircraft that we needed to offset [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7300.139999999999s)]
*  seven hundred and fifty feet, which is not that big of a deal. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7302.94s)]
*  And also, by the way, in the on the reserve parachute, there is [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7305.94s)]
*  there's a computer with a small pyrotechnic charge that has [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7309.58s)]
*  essentially a razor blade that cuts your reserve parachute if it senses [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7312.58s)]
*  a barometric pressure, I believe, barometric pressure, speed and altitude criteria. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7316.46s)]
*  And these things have like hundreds of documented saves. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7321.3s)]
*  Unconscious skydiver, the thing goes off, your reserve comes out, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7323.9800000000005s)]
*  and at least you land under a reserve parachute. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7326.9800000000005s)]
*  They can be offset as well. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7329.46s)]
*  But if you're going to be jumping into a place, let's say you were supposed [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7331.54s)]
*  to land seven hundred and fifty feet higher, and now all of a sudden [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7334.3s)]
*  you're going to land somewhere that's three hundred, you know, sea level, [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7337.58s)]
*  which is essentially what we ended up doing. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7340.58s)]
*  Both the computer in your reserve parachute and the altimeter on your wrist [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7343.18s)]
*  are presenting information to you that is incorrect. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7347.14s)]
*  So when I thought I was at or somebody thought they were at their normal [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7350.34s)]
*  pull altitude of, say, of three thousand feet, they're actually at twenty two hundred and fifty. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7352.78s)]
*  Let's say they have a malfunction and you normally will give yourself [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7358.0199999999995s)]
*  a certain amount of time to work through that. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7360.58s)]
*  You could easily burn through the criteria for your reserve to fire. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7362.42s)]
*  And the next thing you know, you have a dual entanglement with both canopies out. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7365.66s)]
*  And that's how people die. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7369.58s)]
*  So we landed, I looked down and it said negative seven hundred fifty. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7371.74s)]
*  They audibled in the aircraft and just pull out a phone and said, hey, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7374.58s)]
*  we're jumping in here. Nobody had ever seen it. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7377.9s)]
*  There was no real wind indicators on the ground. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7380.46s)]
*  And at that point, after I mean, Mike went and picked a woman up [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7382.42s)]
*  out of a field with a broken leg and on the first jump of the second day. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7385.18s)]
*  So that had already happened that day. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7389.099999999999s)]
*  We got into the plane. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7391.18s)]
*  I'm glossing over a lot of things to try to be as kind as possible [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7393.860000000001s)]
*  to paint a broad picture, though. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7396.7s)]
*  But it had reached for me when we got on the ground, like my safety go, no go. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7398.18s)]
*  I was absolutely just done with what was happening. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7402.02s)]
*  And again, I was just I didn't want to see anybody else get hurt. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7404.26s)]
*  It's it's a dangerous enough activity as it is. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7406.900000000001s)]
*  So one of the organizers happened to be there. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7409.74s)]
*  And I had one of my, you know, about every decade [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7411.9400000000005s)]
*  falling short of how I should actually talk to people. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7415.54s)]
*  And yeah, let them know exactly how I felt this. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7418.820000000001s)]
*  So Mount Everest was run by us. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7422.740000000001s)]
*  Same guy running that is running triple seven. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7425.38s)]
*  Fred Williams is the president of Complete Parachute Solutions. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7428.14s)]
*  We outsourced this one and we had a bit of trust. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7431.580000000001s)]
*  And I think within the first five minutes, we were looking at each other [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7436.1s)]
*  when they briefed all the skydivers were like, something's off here. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7439.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. And we quickly recognized it. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7443.42s)]
*  But funny enough, when they were showing that phone, Andy sort of which [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7444.820000000001s)]
*  and he's a paying customer for this, they made him the jump master. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7450.02s)]
*  So they basically made him one of the the staff. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7453.18s)]
*  And he's looking at me, shaking his head. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7455.700000000001s)]
*  And I remember I'm like, you're a call, dude. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7457.22s)]
*  And at one point, I'm like, I'm always getting out. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7459.660000000001s)]
*  I'm just don't do it. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7461.46s)]
*  So he's like, fuck it. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7462.820000000001s)]
*  And he jumps. And so I go out after him. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7465.3s)]
*  It begs the point, like if your your mom ever asked, hey, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7468.18s)]
*  if your friends jump out off a bridge or perfectly good airplane, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7470.860000000001s)]
*  are you going to do it? Like, hell, yes, I am. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7474.3s)]
*  I mean, I'm going to look at the door first to make sure. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7476.38s)]
*  But that's loyalty. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7478.46s)]
*  And that's try. But that was atrocious. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7479.74s)]
*  And we'll never outsource. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7482.94s)]
*  We'll run every expedition from here forth because we just do it in a way. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7485.7s)]
*  That's the one thing I love about the military is we just mitigate risk, man. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7489.62s)]
*  We go through the checklist as mundane as that may seem or prescribed as it may be. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7492.78s)]
*  But that's why we have so, you know, very few fatalities [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7498.78s)]
*  in our operations compared to, let's say, the civilian skydiving world. Yeah. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7502.9s)]
*  It's dangerous enough as it is. Yeah. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7507.38s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't sound good. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7509.7s)]
*  So had this person done this before? Yes. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7510.860000000001s)]
*  So how they fuck up so hugely. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7514.22s)]
*  Seven hundred fifty feet is a lot. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7517.14s)]
*  Narcissus seven hundred and fifty feet is enough to kill people. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7518.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, it really is. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7521.900000000001s)]
*  Narcissism. No, it wasn't narcissism. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7525.34s)]
*  It was I'm talking about somebody else. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7527.66s)]
*  The reason and so to come to find out that there actually should never have been [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7530.18s)]
*  briefed an offset for the DZ, the altimeter should have just been set for zero. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7533.740000000001s)]
*  It highlighted the lack of structure and communication [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7537.66s)]
*  in the chain of command of that organization. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7540.62s)]
*  Each individual aircraft load was largely operating on their own. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7542.66s)]
*  And there is some inherent danger in that of having something that is actually set, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7547.1s)]
*  briefed. This is the standard. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7550.9400000000005s)]
*  And again, it's one of the beauties. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7552.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, the military can get very overkill sometimes with briefing [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7553.860000000001s)]
*  and risk mitigation, but there's a reason for it. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7557.14s)]
*  And the reason is they've hurt people by not doing that. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7559.62s)]
*  So, yeah, it was. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7563.3s)]
*  Did you talk about day one and now 75 percent of all the first four loads [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7565.3s)]
*  missed the DZ? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7568.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So we were on the first aircraft, the second aircraft. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7570.66s)]
*  I think the closest jumper landed three miles from us to include people [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7572.900000000001s)]
*  landing about five miles away over a river that had a water temperature [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7576.34s)]
*  that was one to two degrees above freezing because it was glacier melt. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7580.14s)]
*  Get some. So any iron on the drop zone, [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7583.9400000000005s)]
*  because we're the first two out of all the 60 skydivers spread across four passes [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7587.14s)]
*  and three hours after the second pass [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7592.74s)]
*  had landed some sky. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7596.5s)]
*  Some Icelanders pull up. Yeah. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7599.46s)]
*  And there were some Icelandic personnel [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7601.259999999999s)]
*  and they came up and they're like, hey, we think you have three skydivers [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7604.74s)]
*  on the other side of the river. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7608.58s)]
*  And it's been three hours. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7609.94s)]
*  So the way we run it is there's a manifest as people land. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7611.46s)]
*  We mark off to make sure that we have a headcount, that we're [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7614.9s)]
*  we're we're controlling all our our personnel. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7617.78s)]
*  And no other jumping occurs until you have a full headcount. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7621.099999999999s)]
*  And somebody could have landed on a [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7626.0599999999995s)]
*  they could have had a compound fracture bleeding out for three hours. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7628.259999999999s)]
*  And we we fell on the ground laughing. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7631.379999999999s)]
*  I know I did. We were laughing. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7636.0199999999995s)]
*  And it wasn't because it's funny. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7637.82s)]
*  We, you know, we cared about those three people, but it was almost comedic. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7639.379999999999s)]
*  How bad this thing was. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7642.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, we'll go back to Iceland. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7644.7s)]
*  We'll go to Norway as well. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7646.94s)]
*  We'll set up those trips and we'll do it our way. Yeah. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7647.86s)]
*  Well, now, you know, well, soup to nuts control having people who do it. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7650.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, it just soup to nuts soup to nuts flash to bang. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7653.9s)]
*  Beginning to end, we will control everything from you say that a lot. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7657.54s)]
*  Soup to nuts. Sometimes you've never said that. No. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7660.78s)]
*  You're welcome to use that term any time you want. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7663.74s)]
*  I don't think I ever will. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7665.54s)]
*  Listen, military, I know I find like an analogy where soup and nuts go together. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7666.66s)]
*  Flash to bang, however you would like to describe it. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7673.62s)]
*  I don't actually kind of make sense. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7675.86s)]
*  It's to nuts is is that not a common term that we use? [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7677.38s)]
*  No, it's not. It's a military. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7680.42s)]
*  Soup to nuts. Yeah. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7682.22s)]
*  What does it mean by soup? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7685.18s)]
*  Well, now that you're asking, I don't fucking know. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7687.06s)]
*  Soup to nuts, Wikipedia soup to nuts, an American English idiom [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7689.46s)]
*  that conveys the meaning of from beginning to end, derived from the description [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7693.3s)]
*  of a full course dinner. Oh, nuts at the end. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7697.02s)]
*  It's a shitty dessert. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7700.54s)]
*  What kind of dessert are they given for clarity? [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7701.66s)]
*  I did not know that. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7703.54s)]
*  It's just something that I heard somebody else say. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7704.3s)]
*  I repeat it was in a 1986 episode of Mama's Family, wherever the fuck that is. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7706.139999999999s)]

*  Stir coffee with your dick. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7752.38s)]

*  My wife's like, what the fuck is that? [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7755.42s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7757.3s)]
*  My kids say the same thing to me, too. Yeah. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7758.26s)]
*  No, it'll be wild. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7760.0599999999995s)]
*  But again, you know, at the end of the day, Joe, it's [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7760.7s)]
*  I love it because it ties me back into that world. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7762.58s)]
*  And like. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7764.58s)]
*  I know too many people [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7766.62s)]

*  I actually I consider what I personally did overseas [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7775.86s)]
*  to be utterly and meaningly useless in the grand scheme of things. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7778.94s)]
*  But I think helping those people out has a greater value than I can describe. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7781.9s)]
*  I was just happy to be there with the team [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7787.62s)]
*  and watching these guys and these guys display selfless valor [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7790.7s)]
*  on a nightly basis. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7794.42s)]
*  I still smile at it. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7795.46s)]
*  But with the documentary, it's it's not for us. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7796.22s)]
*  We are also jumping in memory of one to two veterans on each continent. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7799.58s)]
*  And so Dan Myrick and Christian Kremple controlled the documentary. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7804.9800000000005s)]

*  So have you ever seen the space diving? [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7910.74s)]
*  Alex Bumgarner, Felix Bumgarner, Felix. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7912.86s)]
*  Sorry, it was a rebel. So he jumped. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7915.5s)]
*  He did see that. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7916.86s)]
*  And then a guy named, I think, is Alan Eustace came behind him. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7918.86s)]
*  Who's a Google exec. Correct. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7922.66s)]
*  He beat Felix's record. Yep. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7924.18s)]
*  So, you know, I want to kick Andy out at above 40,000 feet to reclaim that record. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7925.62s)]
*  The wingsuit one, the wingsuit one, maybe maybe even higher. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7932.46s)]
*  And then I want to strap Andy to me and break Alan Eustace's record. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7935.74s)]
*  This is the first I've heard of this. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7941.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's a hard pass. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7942.3s)]
*  I'm working it. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7944.22s)]
*  Contacting SpaceX and and Bluewater, Blue Horizon, whatever it is. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7945.38s)]
*  So after your hip resurfacing, there's no issues like landing. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7950.0199999999995s)]
*  So the hip was so bad. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7955.26s)]
*  That it was masking the right hip. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7959.62s)]
*  And then about a month after I had the surgery, I'm like, wait a second. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7961.98s)]
*  Now you're right. It's killing you. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7965.46s)]
*  So I've got to have a surgery probably in February for a thoroscopy [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7966.9s)]
*  to see if I can get three more years. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7970.62s)]
*  And then it's going to be a hip resurfacing again. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7972.54s)]
*  And then I'll just do the backside of Legacy Expeditions [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7975.22s)]
*  and let these guys do all the crazy stuff. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7977.82s)]
*  Is the resurfacing where they drill the hole and they put the post in [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7979.34s)]
*  and put a new cap on the top of it? Yeah. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7983.0599999999995s)]
*  So they take half the femur head instead of down at the femur. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7984.94s)]
*  So they retain as much bone as possible. Is that better? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7988.54s)]
*  It is. So a lot of hockey players do it and return to the [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7991.179999999999s)]
*  sport. It's like the young man's hip replacement. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7994.78s)]
*  Yeah. I think Frankie Edgar just had that done. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=7996.98s)]
*  Go to Frankie Edgar's Instagram page. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8000.38s)]
*  I think he's got a photo of an X-ray. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8002.38s)]
*  I think he had that done fairly recently and he's still fighting. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8005.38s)]
*  So they go through the the glute. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8009.58s)]
*  They they cut the muscle, the glute muscle. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8011.139999999999s)]
*  And that's why the recovery is a lot longer than a traditional hip [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8013.46s)]
*  replacement, where they go through the thigh and they just move the muscles apart. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8017.139999999999s)]
*  How come they have to cut the the way they they [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8020.78s)]
*  Here's Frankie. I think there's photos of the actual. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8024.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. That's it. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8027.700000000001s)]
*  So they just chop the top off, put that sucker in. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8029.900000000001s)]
*  They do that from the back. Yes. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8032.3s)]
*  So I can't get into the specifics, but eventually if he wears that out [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8034.66s)]
*  and that's lasted now, it's relatively young. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8038.22s)]
*  A new procedure. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8042.62s)]
*  Only the last few decades. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8044.42s)]
*  Some people have lasted 25 years, but if he's still fighting. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8045.58s)]
*  Oh, yo. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8048.740000000001s)]
*  That's harsh. So [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8053.38s)]
*  I guess you guys want to see the scar. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8056.34s)]
*  No, not on the screen. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8057.7s)]
*  Just so the oh, OK, so we can see the graphic. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8058.82s)]
*  So that is it's like a good call, Jamie. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8061.299999999999s)]
*  So it's a steel cap. Is that what it is? [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8064.58s)]
*  Basically, and it fits into do they change the top as well? [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8067.54s)]
*  So they put a medical receptacle or a metal receptacle in the acetabulum. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8071.86s)]
*  And how long is that supposed to last? [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8076.66s)]
*  They've seen up to 25 years. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8079.42s)]
*  It's a relatively relatively new procedure. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8081.22s)]
*  And at 25 years later, do they have to redo it? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8083.820000000001s)]
*  So you can't read that prepared bone. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8087.1s)]
*  They can't redo it. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8089.22s)]
*  So that's when the full hip replacement takes place. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8090.5s)]
*  Boy. So this is just one operation that will lead to possibly another operation. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8093.14s)]
*  So it says prepared bone arthritis removed. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8099.42s)]
*  So that's what they put the cap on. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8102.42s)]
*  Yeah. So they have a hole drilled in the top of Frankie's. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8104.62s)]
*  Is that it's femur? It is. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8107.780000000001s)]
*  It would have to be. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8109.78s)]
*  Mmm. And then the next. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8111.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8114.74s)]
*  Woof. So he's got no he Frank had no cartilage in there. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8116.0199999999995s)]
*  Complete wear of cartilage. Yo. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8120.139999999999s)]
*  I do the procedure was well done here in Austin [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8126.0599999999995s)]
*  by a guy named Jake Manuel. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8129.78s)]
*  So the procedure was great. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8132.099999999999s)]
*  The recovery sucked. How long did it take? [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8133.62s)]
*  Basically about six, six months. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8136.58s)]
*  You start rehab, right? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8139.7s)]
*  I mean, you're doing the in home, you know, small movements [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8141.1s)]
*  for about a month and a half, and then you get a physical therapy. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8144.18s)]
*  But they want you to stay away from any like running [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8146.62s)]
*  or major like deadlifting or things like that for about four to six months. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8149.78s)]
*  And then after that, you can run. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8153.26s)]
*  I'm not running. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8155.3s)]
*  So I want to. But you are landing from the sky. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8157.42s)]
*  And so if you do it right, it's like stepping off like a three inch step. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8160.02s)]
*  But I don't do it right. That's the problem. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8163.42s)]
*  He's not good. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8165.06s)]
*  I have videos. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8169.3s)]
*  And is it supposed to be as tough as a regular hip [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8170.46s)]
*  once it's finished and done so you could do everything? [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8173.900000000001s)]
*  You kick the bag. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8176.34s)]
*  You can do jujitsu. You could do all that stuff. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8177.820000000001s)]
*  Mike doesn't do jujitsu. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8180.38s)]
*  So guys have returned to MMA. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8181.54s)]
*  Guys have returned to skydiving. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8183.780000000001s)]
*  A lot of cyclists have done hockey players. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8186.3s)]
*  So it it can take some punishment. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8188.5s)]
*  And that's why I just sort of keep it for skydiving. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8192.460000000001s)]
*  And I'm not going to run. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8195.94s)]
*  Running is I remember trainers at some point later in our seal careers. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8197.38s)]
*  Like, hey, guys, get your five mile run in. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8201.5s)]
*  And then like, that's good for the week. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8203.38s)]
*  Like, focus on high interval training and save your joints. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8206.38s)]
*  And tell that to Cameron Haynes. Yeah, seriously. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8211.5s)]
*  I don't you can tell it to Cameron Haynes. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8214.42s)]
*  He'll just play. Yeah, cool story. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8216.06s)]
*  Have you seen a lot of joint injuries in jujitsu? [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8219.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Like that would require something like that. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8222.1s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8225.02s)]
*  Because guys are taking it too far or just a natural injured. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8227.460000000001s)]
*  That's the big one. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8231.18s)]
*  Yeah. The guys train injured and they keep re injuring things. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8232.300000000001s)]
*  I feel like I've actually been very lucky so far. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8235.34s)]
*  It you know, talking with Tim this morning, he's like, oh, I'm on my fifth knee surgery. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8238.02s)]
*  And I think that would turn a lot of people away like, no, OK, that's great. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8241.300000000001s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8245.1s)]
*  Tim's got another knee surgery that he just went through. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8246.62s)]
*  I don't think recently it was a few months ago. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8249.06s)]
*  He had an ACL done just about less than a year ago. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8250.86s)]
*  I want to I want to say Dr. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8254.060000000001s)]
*  Kirk Parsley, who was a seal that became a doctor [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8256.78s)]
*  and he was the doctor to the West Coast. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8259.82s)]
*  And the Navy's made him a doctor similar to Johnny Kim. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8261.34s)]
*  He said the average seal and this sounds extremely high to me [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8264.7s)]
*  throughout a 20 year career goes through 11 surgeries. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8267.94s)]
*  I mean, do you have? [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8271.86s)]
*  Well, when I got blown up, I had the shrapnel removal. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8273.220000000001s)]
*  And that was like two or three surgeries. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8276.5s)]
*  And then I had this hip [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8278.7s)]
*  operated on. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8282.220000000001s)]
*  They released me from training. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8283.62s)]
*  And I had an arthroscopy to see if they could heal it. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8286.140000000001s)]
*  And then it was supposed to be a six month recovery. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8289.060000000001s)]
*  I ended up in Afghanistan and a troop commander got hurt. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8291.66s)]
*  And so I slid right into his position prematurely [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8294.740000000002s)]
*  and probably did just reverse whatever they had fixed. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8298.460000000001s)]
*  But it was worth it. It was a great deployment. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8302.1s)]
*  Zero for me. Zero. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8303.740000000002s)]
*  Never had a surgery. Still original. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8305.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's incredible. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8307.98s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. I feel like I've actually been very lucky. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8309.539999999999s)]
*  That's very lucky. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8311.82s)]
*  Well, a lot of Jiu Jitsu guys, it's neck and back as well. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8312.859999999999s)]
*  I know so many guys with like artificial discs. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8316.58s)]
*  Is that from getting stacked? Yeah. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8319.74s)]
*  So my theory on that is if you start stacking me, [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8322.1s)]
*  I'm going to let you right the fuck past. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8324.619999999999s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah, because I care more about my neck. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8326.939999999999s)]
*  And honestly, who gives a shit about what happens on the mat? [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8329.38s)]
*  It's one of it. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8331.74s)]
*  I like I like it. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8332.98s)]
*  Like, I realize that I'm never going to master it. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8334.1s)]
*  I assume I enjoy the training. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8337.619999999999s)]
*  It's physically healthy for me. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8338.939999999999s)]
*  It mentally helps me. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8340.66s)]
*  I can tell that there's no end to the journey. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8342.34s)]
*  Nothing that actually happens happens on the mat matters [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8344.22s)]
*  unless you choose to like make it matter and derive yourself [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8347.74s)]
*  worth from that, which I think would probably lead [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8350.22s)]
*  to having pictures like that out there [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8352.5s)]
*  because you're going to take stuff too far. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8353.699999999999s)]
*  Well, that's a lot. It's a lot of young men. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8355.06s)]
*  You know, the thing is you getting into it when you're in your 40s is better [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8357.14s)]
*  because you have a better understanding of your vulnerability and also your ego. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8360.42s)]
*  And this doesn't matter. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8364.58s)]
*  And that, you know, you're really just about training is about getting better. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8365.78s)]
*  It's not about winning each and every interaction. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8369.14s)]
*  And in fact, if you try to win each and every interaction, [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8371.38s)]
*  you probably won't get better because you'll be so defensive [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8374.58s)]
*  and you'll be so focused on trying to like protect yourself and win [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8378.06s)]
*  that you'll never learn new skills because you won't open up enough. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8383.06s)]
*  And I want to do it when I'm 60. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8386.5s)]
*  It's yeah. Well, pros and cons to picking it up in my 40s. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8388.699999999999s)]
*  You know. Origin camp, I think we talked about this last time. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8393.300000000001s)]
*  So they're opening that camp up to 500 people this year. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8396.980000000001s)]
*  It was 350 last year, and it's the coolest thing ever [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8400.5s)]
*  because you get to see people in their 20s who have been doing Jiu Jitsu [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8403.78s)]
*  since they were four and they laugh at you and you're just like, motherfucker. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8407.54s)]
*  And then you see dudes who are late. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8411.58s)]
*  So you have an example of both of those things. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8413.140000000001s)]
*  But I think for me, the safest bet to continue forward. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8416.78s)]
*  And I try to take this approach even when they're because they're [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8420.62s)]
*  you want to talk about unknown looks. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8422.94s)]
*  There's no way you could. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8424.58s)]
*  Well, I guess you could probably roll with everybody who's there, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8425.220000000001s)]
*  but you would be really, really exhausted. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8427.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You get to see all of those looks. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8429.66s)]
*  But at the end of the day, none of it actually matters [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8432.78s)]
*  if you're just there to learn. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8435.26s)]
*  And that's the approach that I take to it. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8436.34s)]
*  Like, I'm not spoiler. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8437.94s)]
*  I just turned 40, 45 last week. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8439.460000000001s)]
*  World champion is not going to ever be on my. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8442.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, it just it doesn't matter to me. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8444.94s)]
*  But I really like to have like 60 year old still on the mat [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8446.980000000001s)]
*  and can still be competitive to whatever degree would be expected at a 60. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8450.78s)]
*  So it's the love of of the sport, love of the knowledge, getting better. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8454.5s)]
*  That to me, all trumps whether or not you win or lose. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8459.26s)]
*  Because I think the number one way to lose would be sitting in an operating table [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8463.1s)]
*  like that, having that ball and socket. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8466.66s)]
*  You're not doing it to compete. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8468.980000000001s)]
*  I have competed. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8471.18s)]
*  One of my coaches said, you know, when you get a new belt, [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8472.54s)]
*  one of the best things that you can do, because I can tell you this [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8475.42s)]
*  from personal experience that imposter syndrome is super real. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8477.58s)]
*  So if you get a belt, go and enter a competition [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8481.02s)]
*  because you're going to have somebody likely at your age, [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8483.460000000001s)]
*  at your weight, at your belt. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8485.94s)]
*  And you can feel it out with somebody who is not in your gym. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8487.5s)]
*  Because, you know, you know, the game for most people in your gym. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8491.42s)]
*  Imposter syndrome, pretty much my entire same career. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8494.54s)]
*  Same here. You said you're doing STEM, STEM locally. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8498.18s)]
*  I just did, you know, CPI with that clan. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8502.02s)]
*  Scott Nelson in the Tijuana. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8505.78s)]
*  Tijuana, it's funny, all the Jiu Jitsu guys were neck or spine. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8507.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8511.94s)]
*  Yeah, they're doing a lot of great stuff, though, with neck and spine now. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8513.14s)]
*  They can go into the actual disk itself and inject stem cells. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8516.34s)]
*  And they're having a fantastic response from that. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8520.22s)]
*  People actually regenerate disk tissue, which is really amazing. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8522.94s)]
*  So it alleviates a lot of impingements and a lot of pinched nerves [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8526.619999999999s)]
*  and a lot of like bulging disks and shit like that. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8530.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a great time now for biologics, for, you know, [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8533.58s)]
*  the intervention of, you know, stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8536.94s)]
*  injecting them to areas and getting some pretty fantastic healing [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8541.54s)]
*  that just wasn't available in the past. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8545.26s)]
*  You think they'll ever let the stuff that happens down in chips [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8547.060000000001s)]
*  that happen in the US? I fucking hope so. They should. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8549.140000000001s)]
*  How ludicrous is it? [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8552.300000000001s)]
*  Oh, we can't do it here. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8553.58s)]
*  Let's get a flight to San Diego and we'll cross the border. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8554.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking nuts. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8557.300000000001s)]

*  I think it's probably there's probably pressure [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8564.1s)]
*  from pharmaceutical drug companies that would lose money if people [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8567.54s)]
*  developed, you know, methods to treat people where they didn't need [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8570.78s)]

*  Sounds true. Yeah, also true. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8586.1s)]
*  You know, I mean, the idea that they're doing it to protect people is nonsense [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8588.26s)]
*  because you don't have a lot of people that are doing this overseas [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8591.140000000001s)]
*  and doing it in Colombia and where have you and getting fucked up from it. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8593.34s)]

*  and they've gone to Colombia, the biotech place, [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8605.22s)]
*  you know, bio accelerator place rather, you know. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8608.42s)]
*  And then in Austin, there's ways to well, they do it here. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8610.62s)]
*  It's just the things that they can do in other countries is more extreme. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8613.380000000001s)]

*  All of it is the problem with all that stuff is a lack of studies, you know, and [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8670.06s)]
*  there's stage three studies that Dr. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8676.3s)]

*  when they're planning on trying to release that? [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8760.3s)]
*  I think it's a long time from when they filmed actually get something out like that. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8762.34s)]
*  Like a year, something like that. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8766.26s)]
*  Probably we're going to do. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8767.78s)]

*  But hopefully between the combination of the actual event itself, [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8775.98s)]
*  the documentary and it's just I mean, it's really just a matter of eyeballs, [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcgYSGMbW3g&t=8779.54s)]
