# Joe Rogan Experience #1369 - Christopher Ryan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 23, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylQrshWAjuE)
*  And now the official hello. Hello, Chris Ryan. Hello, officially. How are you? Everything.
*  You distinguished looking motherfucker. Am I just saying that's the goatee the whole
*  deal? Yeah, it comes and goes. I don't know. What have you been up to, man? I've been following
*  your Instagram Chronicles. You're traveling the world in a van. What are you doing? Vanthorpe
*  ology. I call it. So vanthorpe ology tour. Yeah. Yeah, I love it, man. It's like, you
*  know, you and I have probably spoken about in my twenties, I backpacked all over the world and
*  hitchhiked to Alaska a couple times and did all these adventures. A Sprinter van that you have a
*  bed in and a cooler and a freezer, that's kind of like a backpack for an older, slightly richer
*  dude. That's how I look at it. Because you have everything you need with you, which is a feeling
*  I love. I love just being able to say, you know what? I'm tired. I'm going to pull over and sleep
*  right here. And before I do, I'm going to have a couple of beers and listen to some music. And
*  you know, it's like everything I need is right here. Right. Can you, what is the deal with pulling
*  over in a Sprinter van and drinking? Are there a lot, you know, you're not even allowed to be
*  drunk in the back seat of your own car. Yeah, I believe if you have a bed, it's considered a
*  domicile. That's what I've been told. I'm not a legal expert. But my understanding is that the
*  front two seats are considered the vehicle. But beyond that, in the back where you have the bed
*  and all the stuff, that's considered your house. So a warrant to search is the same as someone
*  coming into your house. Oh. Yeah. Because I know a dude who got in trouble because he was drunk in
*  the back seat of his car because he knew he was drunk and says like, I'm not fucking driving. I'm
*  just going to sleep it off. And he laid down the back seat of his car and the cops knocked on the
*  door and he opened up the door and he said, yeah, I'm drunk and I'm sleeping off. They arrested him.
*  That's bullshit. Yeah. Well, you know, some cops, they feel like they have to make a certain number
*  of arrests. You know, some places have quotas. Yeah. I've always thought that's so strange. Like
*  what happens if no one commits crimes? What do they do about the quotas? Do they just make up
*  And how do they fill those prisons that are, you know, dependent upon 98% occupancy rate?
*  Yeah. They just assume that there's going to be a certain amount of people that fuck up. Like what
*  happens if something happened? I mean, I don't know what it would be other than a mass consumption
*  of mushrooms across the entire population. Oh, people just stop breaking laws?
*  Yeah. People just stop. They'll just pass the law. I mean, every one of us breaks several laws every
*  day, right? Like there are laws we don't even know exist that we're breaking. Like what kind of laws
*  you think? Oh God, I read an article about this years ago. I'd be hard pressed to give you examples
*  right now, but I'm sure there are financial laws and we're all cheating on our taxes. Not me, not
*  me, but everyone I know except for Joe. Well, I hand mine off to accountants. I don't handle that
*  But I mean, cutting corners, you know, we're all cutting corners. I ran two yellow lights on my way
*  here. I'm sure I probably, you know, it's four miles per hour over the speed limit.
*  So that's how they get you. Yeah. I mean, what about autonomous vehicles?
*  Yeah. Once that kicks into gear, that's going to be real interesting when no one's ever breaking
*  the speed limit. What do they do? What is this, Jamie? Six laws you broke without realizing it?
*  Jamie, you're the best man. Cracked.com always has great articles like this.
*  So what does it say? What do we got here? Connecting to unsecure Wi-Fi networks.
*  That's a law? What? What? So if you go to Starbucks and it's an unsecure or the airport,
*  that's... Those are open for that purpose, but like if someone, your neighbor leaves,
*  there's an open, I think that's what it's saying right here. Oh, why don't do that?
*  Wi-Fi squatting. What about every time you click on one of, you update some software and you click
*  agree, I have read and agree to this. You didn't read that shit. Nobody reads it.
*  One of the things that Snowden talked about yesterday. Yeah. About the terms and conditions
*  right that you accept. And who knows what's in there that then you're not complying with.
*  Well, you'd have to have a lawyer go over every piece of it and then a lot of it is open to
*  interpretation and they can change it at a moment's notice. One of the things that you see in terms
*  and conditions is they have the ability to change it without notice, which is like what...
*  You know, Sam Harris had a great podcast with this guy who was an expert in data collection.
*  He was talking about what's actually happening now is that we have, there's a commodity,
*  that commodity is data and we didn't know it was a commodity. And then all of a sudden these
*  companies like Facebook and Google made billions and billions of dollars off of this commodity
*  that we didn't even know we were giving up. And we didn't know that they had it. We didn't know
*  it was valuable. And then... And there's no way to protect it.
*  And that's their business model. And then also their business model is tricking you
*  into clicking on things by getting you outraged. So they're consistently bringing up things,
*  whether it's Trump or abortion or whatever it is that gets you riled up, that outrage algorithm
*  is going to find your little soft spot. Yeah.
*  Oh, God damn it. I saw you just posted something on that recently on Twitter.
*  Facebook thing, yeah, Facebook. Yeah, it was an argument that Facebook is, what it is, is an
*  algorithm that's designed to find outrage. It's not free speech. And it's just an outrage
*  accelerometer or something. Well, you think about even, you know,
*  that goes back to William Randolph Hearst, you know, saying like, you know, I'll give you the war,
*  you give me the war, I'll sell the papers and get the public behind it because it's good business.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's an interesting world, isn't it?
*  Were you talking about Tristan Harris? Was that the guy on Sam Harris' podcast, the ethicist?
*  I do not know. I don't remember his name.
*  I heard him on Sam Harris' podcast. He was a, I think he has a PhD in computer science and
*  philosophy and he worked at Google as their like in-house ethicist. And then he quit because it's
*  like, don't be evil. Exactly.
*  They stopped having that. Don't be evil doesn't exist anymore.
*  It doesn't exist. Exactly.
*  How crazy is that? When you have that and you go, ah, let's get rid of that.
*  You can be evil.
*  What a weird thing to both have and then weirder still to remove.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I want to get a marriage contract that has that clause in it where you can update it
*  without notification. You know, just get that in there. Have your lawyer slip that into the pre-note.
*  At any moment you could bail and it's fine.
*  Or bail or just change the terms, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It's a strange world, Joe. That's why I like being in my van. Keep
*  things simple.
*  Well, humans are strange creatures, you know, and we vary so widely that, you know, trying to
*  make any sense of putting 300 million of us together on an island essentially.
*  Yeah.
*  Good luck with that.
*  And we vary not only individually, but I think we very, we become different creatures in different
*  conditions.
*  Sure.
*  So people sometimes will ask me like, what's your, you know, what is human nature? What's your
*  opinion, you know, based on these books? And I say it's like asking what's the natural state of H2O?
*  Right. Is it boiling? Is it ice?
*  Exactly. What's the pressure? What's the altitude?
*  Yeah. Don't you feel like you're different people with different people as well?
*  Yeah. Yeah. I had a girlfriend, a Spanish, she was, her mother was French, her father's Catalan.
*  She was raised in Spain and then lived in Miami when she was 13 to 15 or something.
*  So she spoke English really well, Spanish, French, and Catalan perfectly. Right.
*  And we were living in San Francisco and I was high, I was smoking a joint. She was across the
*  room talking to her mom on the phone in French. And then her mom put her dad on the phone. So
*  she switched to Catalan. And I was just high enough that I noticed like, wow, that's not
*  Peggy talking two different languages. And then three, because she would like put her hand on the
*  phone and say, my mom said, no, no, no. So English, French, Catalan. It's not Peggy speaking three
*  languages. Those are three different Peggies. She's different. Her facial tics and her movements and
*  her body position changed depending on the language she was speaking. Right. And at the time I was in
*  grad school and I thought this is like multiple personality disorder. So I started researching
*  multiple personality and I sort of came up with this idea that language, in her case,
*  because she learned them all when she was very young, reconfigures the brain in such a way that
*  she actually has different identities in those languages. And next time we were fucking, I
*  started talking to her in Spanish and she freaked out. She got mad at you?
*  Yes. Like I was a stranger suddenly.
*  Whoa.
*  I just said, you know, I just said like, you're beautiful or something. She's like,
*  ah, get away. It's my guava. Eddie's my guava. Like, get away from me, you creep.
*  Because our whole relationship had been in English. Yeah. Yeah. It was strange. So anyway,
*  so I looked into multiple personality disorder. The story has everything. And I don't know if you've
*  checked that out. You remember Stanley Kripner, my buddy who came down and did the podcast with you?
*  He had done a bunch of research on that. And there was a movie called Sibyl.
*  Yeah, I remember that.
*  He was the consultant for that movie. He was also a consultant for Rosemary's Baby. Remember that?
*  The possession?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Anyway-
*  That's a Polanski movie.
*  I think so. Yeah. Yeah. One of the early ones.
*  People have, with multiple personality disorder, the research is bizarre. It seems to indicate
*  that people have different physiological states in the different personalities.
*  So you could have a different baseline heart rate, blood pressure, these sort of-
*  Different baseline heart rate?
*  Yeah, in the different. Even, now this is, I don't know how reliable this is, but I even read
*  that some people have different ocular pressure. So that one personality needs reading glasses
*  and another doesn't.
*  What?
*  Oh my God. How much is psychosomatic? Like really, how much of who you are and how your body works
*  is dependent upon the way your brain is catching things?
*  Yeah. Right. Culture, language, personal experience, I mean, it's all your mood,
*  how much you slept the night before, all these things tie into. Identity is something we take
*  for granted, but if you start to look at it, it's like gravity. Gravity we sort of included
*  in our calculations, but nobody has any idea what's happening. How does that work?
*  Right. Right.
*  Neil deGrasse Tyson got real touchy about it.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I brought it up, I think he's, we had a weird conversation and I think
*  part of the weird conversation was the first conversation that he's had publicly since he's
*  been accused of sexual misconduct.
*  Right. But he came back from that.
*  Well, they found him innocent according to whatever internal investigation they had
*  when they were doing his television show, the planetarium, but it's still, even if he's proven
*  innocent, you've got the weight of who knows how many people that think you're a creep now.
*  And he's carrying that around because he was always thought of as being this jovial,
*  really sweet, nice guy. So he's a little tense anyway.
*  That's why I start out admitting I'm a creep.
*  It's good.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I am a fucking creep.
*  You can't shame Charlie Sheen. You cannot shame Charlie Sheen. But we had this conversation
*  about gravity and it was weird. It was like I was arguing with him, but I wasn't arguing.
*  It was like, I was like, what is causing you? Like what causes it? And he's like, we know.
*  Like he went into this whole thing. We know what it is. We know how to measure it. We can,
*  that's good enough for me.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a very tense conversation.
*  That's interesting.
*  Because it is a faith-based thing there. Like he's right, they know how to measure it.
*  But we also know how to measure a placebo. And we don't know how the fuck that works.
*  We know that hypnosis, people can have open heart surgery under hypnosis or have limbs amputated
*  or all sorts of amazing things with no anesthesia whatsoever.
*  Has that really been done?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you ever been hypnotized?
*  Yeah. But I don't have high hypnotic ability. That differs. It's another thing that differs
*  among people. And Stanley actually has a really interesting theory along those lines, which is
*  that in prehistoric populations, hypnotic ability would be adaptive because a lot of the healing
*  rituals were keying into placebo response. So if we have a certain ritual, if you're susceptible
*  to, you know, you believe in that, like voodoo, there's a voodoo death. People die when a spell
*  is cast or a curse. Because they believe it. If you don't believe it, it doesn't happen. So it happens
*  the opposite direction as well with healing. So his idea is that that would have been a very adaptive
*  characteristic in prehistoric societies, whereas in contemporary societies, it's maladaptive
*  because you're more susceptible to advertising or you're easier to manipulate.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah. So I, yeah, I've, when I was in grad school, I had some professors who worked with hypnosis and
*  I studied it a bit along the same, around the same time I was looking at multiple personality
*  disorder. Because I was real interested in this question of how the brain and the body interact,
*  how much of, you know, there's all this research showing that people with the same condition in
*  hospitals, exactly the same age, same prognosis and all that, they heal significantly faster if
*  their hospital window looks out on trees as opposed to looks out at another building.
*  That makes sense.
*  Just looking at something like nature keys the body into some sort of energy that helps it to heal.
*  Completely makes sense. I've met people with multiple personalities. Well, Roseanne,
*  Roseanne's got multiple, doesn't she? Make sure that's true. I know another one that's a weird
*  one is the football player Herschel Walker. I think he had trauma induced multiple personality
*  disorders. Does she?
*  Wow.
*  There's articles that says like Bill Maher reminds us she does and then Roseanne says she doesn't.
*  Yeah, I think she does.
*  And then 2001 says having seven personalities is tough, her saying it.
*  Well, here's the thing about Roseanne. I mean, I'm saying this for the tenth time, I guess.
*  She was hit by a car when she was 15 and she was put in a mental institute for nine months afterwards.
*  She had severe brain damage and she lost her ability to do mathematics and like really
*  scrambled her brain. And that is probably the birth of the Roseanne that we know, the comedian.
*  And that's also the case with Sam Kinnison. Sam Kinnison was also like a pretty normal kid and
*  then he was hit by a car and pretty severe brain damage as well. And brain damage for especially,
*  um, apparently it especially has an impact on your ability to be rational and impulsive behavior.
*  Like people with brain damage, a lot of times get very impulsive. It's a bit very so widely.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's what happens to you dependent upon like what kind of trauma, where the trauma is,
*  what part of your brain. But when they said it about Herschel Walker, I was always confused.
*  I wonder if it was from football, like football trauma or was it personal trauma, like, you know,
*  abuse?
*  Yeah. People with, are diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, if I remember correctly,
*  almost always were severely abused as kids. You know, and in fact, the rationale is that they
*  develop the alternate personalities as a way of escaping a reality that's intolerable.
*  Makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, look, people do weird things with horrible memories. You know, they bury them to
*  the point where they don't even really have access to them anymore. Sexual abuse and some,
*  some traumatic events when you're young. But the human brain then the way it adapts and molds to
*  things is so bizarre.
*  Yeah. There's a, there's an anecdote that is in this book, civilized to death. Notice that segue.
*  Oh, good segue.
*  Pull that bitch over here.
*  Yeah. It's, by the way, the art is done by a guy who listens to my podcast.
*  Oh.
*  It's really.
*  It looks like the art by a guy who listens to your podcast.
*  A cheeseburger, a chimp wearing a cheeseburger with a nice suit on.
*  Yeah. He's got an iPhone. Oh yeah, the story. So there's a species of grasshopper in North Africa
*  that, you know, they hang out, they're grasshoppers. They're dispersed. They eat grass.
*  They're chill, right? Rains come, the grasslands expand, grasshopper population increases.
*  Then the rain stop. The grasslands contract to the point where the density of the grasshoppers
*  triggers dormant genes. So there's an epigenetic event in these grasshoppers and they start to
*  transform and not over generations, individuals, front legs get shorter, back legs get longer,
*  thorax changes, shape of the head changes, coloring changes and behavior changes from
*  being these chilled out, solitary, relaxed grasshoppers. They start attacking each other.
*  They become cannibalistic and they swarm.
*  Locust.
*  Locust. Exactly. They become locust.
*  Yeah.
*  So this species of grasshopper and locust is the same species. It's the same DNA. It's just
*  responding to different conditions. So, you know, we're talking about the brain and, you know,
*  who you are and what identity is and all that. And this, I was reminded of this when you said,
*  you know, people are so different and the H2O thing. We're not only different as individuals
*  in the same context, we change completely given the context we're in. So the focus of this book
*  is that hunter-gatherers were essentially a different sort of animal. They were essentially,
*  you know, the parallels with the grasshoppers and now we're swarming.
*  Yeah.
*  Now we're a different kind of animal even though our DNA is the same.
*  Well, that completely makes sense. I mean, people that live in small towns are so different than
*  people that live in cities. It's so rare that you find someone who has a small town sensibility
*  in Manhattan. You know?
*  Yeah, they get chewed up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Literally.
*  Yeah, literally. Yeah. It's, that's, the locust thing's amazing. Have you ever written or read,
*  rather, the accounts of the settlers in the, you know, the pioneer days making their way across
*  the country and dealing with these swarms of locusts and really not having any idea what to
*  do with them or how to handle it?
*  Eat them.
*  Yeah, yeah, you can.
*  The Native Americans ate them. Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah. That's probably a real good move, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That's one of the things that people think is probably an excellent solution to some of the
*  issues that people have with meat because a lot of people don't have any problem killing bugs,
*  but they wouldn't want to kill a lamb.
*  Right.
*  You know? But you can have cricket proteins.
*  We call it microagriculture.
*  Yeah, yeah. Cricket protein is apparently like very healthy.
*  It's good. I've eaten crickets.
*  Yeah, I have too.
*  In Thailand?
*  I've had them in Mexico.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Mexico, they had them fried and we were staying in a resort in, where was it?
*  Punta Mita? Yeah, I think it was down there. Puerto Vallarta.
*  And they had a bowl in the resort like when we walked into the hotel room.
*  Like mints.
*  Yeah, they had like sliced mangoes and then they had fucking crickets and I was like,
*  all right, I'll try that. I hosted Fear Factor.
*  There's a restaurant here in LA that I was at just a couple of weeks ago that has all sorts
*  of crickets and grasshoppers.
*  Really? What's it called?
*  It's a Mexican place. They specialize in mole.
*  I don't remember what it's called.
*  A good Mexican place?
*  It's really good.
*  Isn't it weird that like there's a lot of great Mexican food in LA, but it's like,
*  you know, like your basic burrito joints and taco, it's not like gourmet Mexican food.
*  There's very few gourmet Mexican places.
*  Oh, this place is-
*  Is that it right there?
*  Yeah, that's it. That's right. Couldn't remember the name.
*  Jamie.
*  Jamie.
*  Guelaguetza.
*  Jamie's on top of it. Is that it? Have you been there?
*  I know the word. It's like a, I don't know if it means party, but it's a celebration down
*  in like, I think Oaxaca.
*  Yeah.
*  Damn.
*  Oaxaca.
*  Serving up insects.
*  Yeah, check it out. It's a good place. I really, the mole's fantastic.
*  Where is that at? What part of LA?
*  On Olympic.
*  Olympic.
*  Okay. Deep in the heart of Texas.
*  Yeah.
*  Bam. Beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  Mole. I love mole.
*  And let's face it, shrimp, lobster, that's just bugs. Those are just big sea bugs.
*  Well, we found that out on Fear Factor, it was people that are allergic to shellfish are also
*  allergic to roaches. Yeah, we found that out the hard way.
*  On a lawsuit?
*  No, no. The dude was allergic to shellfish and he had to eat roaches for this thing. And
*  you know, they wound up having to give him an adrenaline shot.
*  Oh, yeah. EpiPen.
*  Yeah. He was a seasoned up a little bit.
*  That's not good.
*  Your windpipe starts constricting.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not allergic to anything as far as I know.
*  Congratulations.
*  I'm very happy. Yeah.
*  Me too. Yeah. That's a bummer, man. Allergies are a bummer, especially freaking peanuts.
*  I've heard peanut allergies are so bad that people will ask you to not eat peanuts on a plane
*  with someone who has a peanut allergy. Like some people's peanut allergy is so severe,
*  even like the dust of you chewing peanuts on a plane next to them can get them sick.
*  And it's interesting to think about the state of consciousness and how that affects allergies,
*  because apparently, and again, I'm always cautious about saying shit on the show
*  because there's so many people listening. So caveat, it's been a long time since I read
*  the research. But if I remember correctly, under hypnosis, a lot of people with allergies no longer.
*  In fact, I remember the research. Yeah, it was a setup where the person could see.
*  So like you and I are talking across the table and there's a mirror behind me.
*  And in the mirror, in your peripheral vision, you see roses and you're allergic to roses.
*  You'll have a reaction, even though they're plastic roses. So it sort of enters the
*  consciousness and triggers the response subconsciously. Yeah, I think that's how it was.
*  And then with people under hypnosis, like Andrew Weil wrote about this,
*  cat allergies. He was tripping, he was on MDMA, I think, and he was playing with a cat and had
*  no reaction to it. Wow.
*  Yeah. Look at this. Self-hypnosis squelches allergies.
*  I need a Jamie in my life. You do.
*  Damn. Picturing ski slopes reduces hay fever symptoms by a third.
*  Look at that. Picturing ski slopes. How weird.
*  Well, because you're picturing a place where there's no pollen.
*  Right. Right.
*  You could probably picture the surface of Mars too.
*  Yeah. Well, if you've got a needle, you get a shot and the doctor's about to give you the shot
*  and you start tensing up, you feel the anticipation. Your heart starts quickening
*  and you get really weirded out by it. But then you get the shot and you're like,
*  oh, that wasn't shit. Why was I freaking out like that? But it's the psychosomatic aspect of it.
*  I think that's what life is, basically, in a nutshell.
*  It's an analogy.
*  We're always worried about things. We spend so much time worrying about things,
*  most of which never occur. Yeah.
*  And even the ones that do occur, it's like, wow, whatever. Like death. I'm not worried about death.
*  Dying, maybe, if it takes too long. But if it takes like an hour or a day to die,
*  that's a tiny fraction of your life. Who gives a shit?
*  You're not a guy that really spends a lot of time working on fitness or health or anything.
*  That's a nice way to put it.
*  You enjoyed that article that I wrote back in the day.
*  Lazy fuck is what you're trying to say.
*  I wasn't gonna say that, man. I love you.
*  But I...
*  I take it as a compliment.
*  You enjoyed...
*  I got better things to do than work out, Joe.
*  I get it. You enjoyed that article that I wrote a long time ago.
*  I did. The sands.
*  Yeah, human body is like a sandcastle.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you can make it beautiful, but it's not gonna last.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know that going in. You know that way.
*  Yeah. And I've got this idea for a book, if I keep writing books,
*  which is sort of a self-help book, but it's a parody of self-help books.
*  And so it'll be calling attention to the way so much of what we do to try to be
*  healthy is actually counterproductive because we stress, especially Americans.
*  Sure.
*  Everything turns into work. And Americans are very suspicious of pleasure. We're taught to
*  that pleasure is evil and dangerous and all this. I've never bought that line of reasoning.
*  I've always felt like what feels good generally is good. There's a reason it feels good.
*  Now that can get corrupted by advertising and false messaging from a sick society that tells you,
*  sit on the sofa and drink beer and eat bags of chips all day. But if you get beyond that
*  and you can actually hear the voice of your body, I think if your body is telling you to
*  you know, stay in bed because it's a rainy cold day. Now I know this is totally against your
*  perspective on life where you're like, you got to tame the inner bitch. You got to get out of bed.
*  You got to work out. It doesn't matter. I'm like, no, man, I'm staying in bed.
*  Like you go do what you need to do. I used to climb mountains with this friend of mine in Spain
*  and he was like you, he was a fucking Billy goat. He'd like go up the, and I'd go with him till I
*  got to a nice spot with a nice view. I'd be like, dude, I'll be here when you come down.
*  Taking a nap, got a bottle of wine and some cheese.
*  Pete I appreciate that too. I'm not married to my perspective, but I think I have
*  a very peculiar biology that demands a certain amount of exertion.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete Me personally.
*  Pete Sure. And I have friends like that. I mean, I, you know, lots of friends like, man,
*  if I don't run every day, I feel like shit. I'm like, I feel fine.
*  Pete Yeah. You get used to it. There's a high that you get from running that's really interesting.
*  And any long term cardiovascular exercise, you get this. It's like we did, you know, last October,
*  we did the Sober October thing where we had this crazy fitness challenge. So, all of us were doing
*  cardio like five hours a day, like really crazy amounts of cardio. And one of the things that
*  Tom Segura and I both agreed on is like, the amount of internal chatter dissipates to zero.
*  Pete Mm hmm.
*  Pete Like you have no anxiety. It goes, I didn't realize I had any anxiety until that happened.
*  And then I was like, God, it goes to zero. It goes to nothing. Like when you do like
*  five hours on a treadmill or you're just running, just run, when it's done, man, there's this like
*  peace of mind that comes with that. This release of endorphins that's incredibly addictive because
*  that feeling is so pleasing. So, it's not that it doesn't, it doesn't feel good to get out of bed
*  and to just push when you don't want to, but the end result feels amazing. It does feel really good.
*  I wonder if there's any research looking into whether that effect happens universally.
*  Because I've worked out, I've run, there were times in my life, I've never gotten a runner's
*  high. Never. I get my teeth hurt, my knees hurt, my back hurts, I feel my brain bouncing around in
*  my skull. You know, I'm half a mile into it and I'm like, fuck this. This doesn't feel good.
*  Pete You have to get in shape first. That's a big part of it. It's not that simple. It's like,
*  for me, I never really got into running. Like the first time I really did any serious running,
*  my friend Cam Haynes had a 5k, which is, what is that, three miles? Something like that?
*  Something like that, yeah.
*  Pete And I didn't run at all in preparation for it. And when I ran the 5k, I was like,
*  Jesus Christ, this is hard. Like I didn't have, there was no good feeling at all.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete You know, it's running on concrete and shit. In Vegas, it's gross.
*  Pete Oh, in Vegas.
*  Pete It's smelling sand in the air. But when it was over, I was like, okay, obviously,
*  I'm in good shape, but not in good running shape at all, so I should probably get in shape for this.
*  And then I started running. And then when I got into running, and particularly running hills,
*  then I started feeling it once I kind of got in that kind of shape. And then when the, you know,
*  when the workouts are over, like I run all the time now. And when it's over, I just have this,
*  ah.
*  Pete Yeah, you and Marshall are doing your thing. It's great.
*  Pete Yeah, I fucking love it. And he loves it too. They have a crazy bonding experience with
*  that dog, you know, because he loves it. You know?
*  I got my dad a Golden Retriever years ago when my dad was like, you know, maybe it's genetic
*  because he was pretty lazy. He'd come home from work and he'd sit in front of the TV and drink
*  vodka and get upset about the news. And my mother didn't like dogs, but my sister and I convinced
*  her that dad needs a dog because dad will get this dog and he'll go for walks because the dog needs
*  to walk. So, we got him a Golden Retriever. He named it Stoli. Bad sign right there. And then,
*  he never went for walks. Stoli just sat next to him and got fat.
*  Pete Oh, poor Stoli.
*  Pete I know, I know.
*  Pete Well, it's common.
*  Pete Doesn't always work.
*  Pete No. Yeah, it helps me get going because I know that he needs exercise.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete It does. But it helps me too. And it's fun. Like, I talk to him when we run, you know? I guess
*  we're running, you know? I have little conversations with him.
*  Pete Yeah. Cool.
*  Pete Fun.
*  Pete He's not judging you, right?
*  Pete Pretty much.
*  Pete I could be fat, I could be covered in shit.
*  Pete He'd probably prefer that.
*  Pete Roll around.
*  Pete Make it more interesting.
*  Pete Yeah. But the runner's high is a real thing. But you have to achieve some level of fitness
*  before I think it kicks in.
*  Pete Yeah, I, closest I've come to that is the sex high.
*  Pete Hmm.
*  Pete You know?
*  Pete Post.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete No, during. Maybe there's like a workout element to that.
*  Pete Well, sex when you're really aroused and you're really attracted to the person,
*  like in the middle of the act of it, it's like you're on a drug.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete It can be like this incredible elevation where you're high basically. You're high in this crazy
*  Pete Sure, endorphins.
*  Pete aroused state.
*  Pete Yeah. And you have that hyper focus that you're talking about, you know, removing anxiety,
*  you're not thinking about, you know, anything other than where you are. It's one of those
*  beautiful moments. I had a guy on my podcast recently who's like a legend in the world of
*  high risk stuff. He's a base jumper and he flies those wingsuits.
*  Pete What's his name?
*  Pete Oh, fuck, what is his name? He lives in Bozeman, Montana.
*  Pete Andy Stump?
*  Pete No.
*  Pete That's crazy because my friend Andy Stump lives in Montana too.
*  Pete I'm sure he knows him.
*  He holds the world record for that wingsuit shit.
*  Pete Ben Stewart, could it be? Man, I don't remember.
*  Pete I'm sure Andy knows him.
*  Pete Yeah, for sure.
*  Pete He lives in Bozeman.
*  Pete And this guy's 44. He's been doing it a long time and –
*  Pete It's about how old Andy is. Andy's probably a little younger than that.
*  Pete They probably fly together. Yeah, really nice guy. But it was interesting like how,
*  you know, here's this guy who's doing this super high risk adrenaline stuff. Like he just had done
*  this thing where he's paragliding with another dude on the Brooks Range in Alaska.
*  Pete Oh, it seems crazy.
*  Pete Like just the two of them and they land and camp.
*  Pete Oh my God.
*  Pete You know, nowhere, bears everywhere, like forget it. And then they get up the next morning,
*  jump off the mountain and keep going. It's such a fuck. But this guy was so calm. He was just like,
*  he was like talking to Buddha or something. He was just like so centered and relaxed and
*  focused. It was beautiful. We had a really enjoyable conversation from my perspective anyway,
*  because I tend to be kind of scattered and, you know, tangentially speaking, right?
*  Pete Right, right.
*  Pete I'm going all over the place. Whereas he was just like,
*  he was just really centered and balanced. It was nice.
*  Pete I guess you have to have laser focus if you're going to fuck around with that kind of stuff.
*  Pete That's it. You don't want to –
*  Pete Is that the J.M.?
*  Pete Yeah, Jeff Shapiro. That's him. Yeah.
*  Pete Look at him.
*  Yeah, thanks, Jamie. Yeah, and that's his falcon. He's got this falcon as well.
*  Pete Right when I was starting to love him.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete He's got a fucking falcon.
*  Pete He's all into flight, man. He's the thing. Yeah, he's a cool dude.
*  Pete Those wingsuits, man. I mean, talk about risk versus reward.
*  Pete Fuck. He told his story. He was like, he said, yeah, you know, I've had the experience
*  a few times of standing on this toes over the cliff, 3000 feet up or whatever, and
*  fist bump with your buddy, and he goes and says, see you down there, he goes, and then you hear it.
*  Pete Bang.
*  Pete Yeah, he's gone. Like I've carried dude's bodies out of the woods, you know.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete I've done that too many times. He was talking about, you know, these different approaches and
*  how the young guys tend to be more, fuck it, man, they think they're indestructible and in his age,
*  he's seen enough, he's carried enough bodies, he's lost enough friends that he's not thinking that
*  way anymore, you know, and he doesn't want to be around guys who are because he doesn't want to
*  deal with the trauma, you know.
*  Pete Well, it's all, there's a competitive aspect to it too. Like, come on, don't be a pussy.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete You know, like that stuff can get you killed too because then it just like sort of
*  hijacks your own way of interacting with whatever the fuck this danger is.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete Yeah, peer pressure.
*  Pete Yeah, that's real. Yeah.
*  Pete I start off, I'm a pussy. I'm a creep. I'm a pussy. You know, like, you got no leverage.
*  Pete Peer pressure.
*  Pete I'm lazy.
*  Pete You know what fascinates me, man? Mob mentality.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete Mob mentality like, you know, if there's like a riot, like physical violence.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete In a way that you would never, like, a lot of people who would never think about hitting
*  someone when people are hitting people all over the place, you'll just dive in. Like,
*  people will dive in and kick people and punch people. It's very weird.
*  Pete Like bar fights, you see. I've never seen one in real life.
*  Pete I've seen a bunch of them.
*  Pete Does that happen? People just randomly punching each other?
*  Pete Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. People just punch people. Yeah. I've seen some pretty chaotic brawls.
*  It's, but there's a strange feeling in the air. It's almost like a smell. You know, like,
*  Jim, you're not a –
*  Jared I was in a riot and that earlier in the day, we were like, the hornet's nest is going to
*  explode tonight. We kind of felt it.
*  Pete What was the premise?
*  Jared After the Ohio State Michigan game in like 2002.
*  Ohio State Michigan game, I know you don't really understand the football thing of it, but there,
*  it's a huge day, big event. We won in a very close game, undefeated season for Ohio State,
*  so they were headed to the National Championship. This then meant sofas on fire in the street for
*  like the next couple hours. And then shortly as the night exploded, there was a couple bonfires in
*  the middle of the street. We went, we saw that on the news, so we went close to see it because we
*  were a couple blocks away. As we got close, we heard the knee knocker bullets getting fired out,
*  so everybody scattered.
*  Pete Well, those rubber bullets?
*  Jared Yeah, from like, so everyone went from one street on campus to like three other streets.
*  Then it started up again. The street I was on, seven cars got flipped over, I think,
*  and lit on fire. So, people started trying to like move their cars so they didn't lose it
*  because their college kids don't have any money, whatever. A lot of those people got caught on
*  videos, expelled from school, whatever. But at the end of that street, I was, we were on it,
*  we saw all the riot police, the SWAT team like lining up. They started firing out tear gas
*  everywhere. A tear gas canister ended up on the porch of the house we were in, like exploded in
*  the house almost. So, like we were all coughing and had to get the fuck out of there. It lasted
*  for a couple hours. Like no one died, anything like that. There wasn't a lot of violence, but just
*  12 to 15 cars got fucked up.
*  Pete The thing is, someone could have died. That's what's really, that's, what's really crazy about
*  those chaotic moments of violence is that when something's in the air and you see like a big
*  brawl going on, it's like everything seems, it seems like civilization's flimsy. Like for that
*  brief moment, I think there's a natural thing that kicks in with people that sort of allows them to
*  act in war and allows them to act like when the tribe is invaded. Like when, you know, when a
*  neighboring army invades your village, there's some thing that kicks in where you like recognize
*  this is violence and you just look to swing on anybody that's around you. And you see it in these
*  brawls when you see some sort of a riot. Like you see these people and you're like, I guarantee you
*  that guy's never punched anybody before in his life. And he's running over trying to punch people
*  and everybody's punching everybody. And people are swinging and you see it in these fucking,
*  whenever you see like an Antifa versus Proud Boys type thing, you know what I mean? Like these
*  left versus right Trump supporters versus Bernie bros and you see chaos.
*  You're talking about online or in the street?
*  Online, I haven't seen those in person, but when you see these moments where,
*  these tribal moments where it feels like it could break out into violence at any time,
*  there's a smell in the air. It's like it changes the atmosphere of the air and you feel like you've
*  got to protect yourself. Like anything can happen at any moment from people that you would never
*  think of as being violent. Like you would never assume that these folks would be violent to you.
*  They don't look scary. They're not scary looking people, but everybody just seems to get on. It's
*  like a thing happens, like the locusts. Like a little trigger happens with people.
*  Dormant behavior patterns.
*  Yeah. I've often wondered about what that is because I've been around it a bunch of times.
*  And well, I was around it once big time in high school. When I was in high school, there was a
*  kid who lived in this really nice house and he'd moved into the neighborhood for the first time
*  and he decided he was going to have a party to meet a bunch of people, make friends. And people
*  started robbing his house and a brawl broke out. I'll never forget it. And I was there, I was there
*  at the event horizon of the brawl. I was there at the moment it happened. A girl did something to a
*  guy. I can't remember what she did. I can't remember if she threw a drink at his face or if she hit him.
*  I don't remember, but I remember him hitting her because I remember him pulling his hand back and
*  I'm like, oh my God, he's going to punch her in the face. And boom, he punched her right. I mean,
*  he knew how to punch too. It was like a real punch to the face. The girl goes unconscious and then
*  she falls back and then chaos. I mean, people diving on top of people, piles of people out in
*  the yard. Everybody's fighting everybody. You're just ducking. It's like a movie.
*  And then-
*  And almost everyone has no idea what they're even fighting about.
*  No, I saw the moment it happened. I was there. God, I wish I could remember. Memory is so sucky.
*  It really is. I have this blurry slide, but I do remember that fist hitting her face.
*  Because I remember he went like this. I was like, oh no, he knows how to punch. And he went, bang!
*  He just cracked her in the face. And she is like, her head went back and she went out cold. And
*  I think somebody caught her. I think somebody caught her as she was going down. And then it was
*  just melee. But I remember the feeling in the air. Because that was the first time I think I'd ever
*  been around anything like that. I was like, whoa, it's piles of kids fighting on the-
*  And were you fighting?
*  No, I was running away from everybody. I was like, I need to get the fuck out of here.
*  I mean, I always did martial arts, but I was very, very rarely involved in any
*  extracurricular altercations. So I just got the fuck out of there. And the other time was when
*  I was a security guard for Great Woods. Great Woods is a place in Mansfield, Massachusetts,
*  was like this concert venue. And Neil Young was playing, of all people. And there's a lawn area.
*  I've slept in his bed.
*  Have you really?
*  Yo, I can't tell that story. Shit.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah, never mind. But I haven't.
*  Race a race back, memory.
*  So it's an amphitheater. So there's this covered, seated area. And then behind the covered,
*  seated area is this gigantic lawn area. And I don't remember if it was cold out. I remember
*  what the deal was. But people started lighting fires on the lawn, like little bonfires. And
*  then it's just, then chaos broke out. We started trying, the security people started trying to
*  put out the fires and tell people to stop. And then people started hitting people and just crazy.
*  And I always kept a hoodie with me because I was getting like $9 an hour or something like that.
*  I'm not going to get shot for $9 an hour or beat up. Fuck this.
*  So as soon as shit went crazy, I put my zip up, I put my hoodie on. I'm like, I quit.
*  I quit the job.
*  Nice.
*  And as I was leaving, as I was quitting, I was watching people just beat the fuck out of people.
*  And I was like dodging my way through this thing. I'm like, get out of here with this stupid fucking
*  job.
*  Yeah. You got to know when to leave, man.
*  But it was a feeling. It was like, oh, there's that fucking smell in the air. Like anything
*  can happen at any moment now.
*  Yeah. I mean, you think about these dudes who come back from war with PTSD. Again,
*  it's this consciousness context dependent behavior where they do things in that situation
*  and then they come back to the normal world. It's like coming out of a dream.
*  And it's hard to believe you did that. It's hard to believe that was you. And how do you
*  integrate that into your life with your wife and your kids and mom and dad and the neighbors?
*  I mean, those poor guys, they're dealing with some real heavy shit there.
*  And no one tells you how to do that either.
*  No, no one knows how to do it.
*  Right.
*  Yeah. And no one gives a shit, right? Like once they get there,
*  get you to go do what they want to do, then it's hard to even get,
*  there's what, a two year wait for any sort of psychological counseling.
*  Is there really?
*  Yeah. It depends on the state, but at least that. I had a guy on the podcast,
*  actually the one Jamie showed us right before the wingsuit dude was a dude who'd been in Iraq.
*  And then he came back and worked as a SWAT team commander. So he was like doing all sorts of
*  really heavy stuff. And then he just got out. And now he's living off grid in Idaho raising three
*  little boys with his wife. And he's a former Mormon. So he sort of talked about how
*  his Mormonism taught him to respect authority and do what he was told. And that just fed right into
*  his experience in the army and with the police. But man, I have so much compassion for those guys
*  who get out and look back and say, what did I do? Who was that guy?
*  Right. And how they sort of like stop that, like stop the thought process when they come back into
*  civilization, but still have the memories.
*  And how do you trust yourself? That I'm not going to hurt anyone else. Yeah, it's hard. And yeah,
*  just saying that they get very little support. They're sent off to do this horrible stuff. And
*  then they come back and it's like, okay, no, don't do that anymore.
*  Yeah. The incremental progress that we achieve as a civilization is it's amazing, but also so
*  frustratingly slow that no one, I mean, no one I've ever talked to thinks there's going to be a
*  moment in our lifetime where there's no war. No one. No one thinks there's going to be a moment
*  in our lifetime where there's no murder. No one thinks there's going to be a moment in our
*  lifetime where there's no rape, where we just figure it out. Like I'm pretty confident if it
*  was just the three of us forever, no one would rape anybody. No one would murder anybody.
*  Just the three of us?
*  Just the three of us.
*  I sure hope not.
*  But you know what I'm saying?
*  Because I'm probably the victim here.
*  But you know what I'm saying? Like what number of people, how many people do they have to be
*  before one of those things becomes a possibility? If you have a group of close friends, a group of
*  close friends who are good communicators and good, honest, healthy, friendly people can live
*  together. And whatever issues you might have with someone not doing the dishes or someone forgetting
*  to put back your lawnmower or whatever the fuck it is, you could work that out. It's no big deal.
*  Like what's the number of people?
*  150.
*  Okay.
*  That's Dunbar's number.
*  Dunbar's number, yeah.
*  I'm sure you've heard about that.
*  Yeah, I mean that might really be it. That might really be what we're programmed for.
*  Well, that's where hunter gatherer groups always splinter.
*  Yeah.
*  They never get beyond that. And I think that's why, because a hunter gatherer group,
*  which is egalitarian and sharing and cooperative and all that, by necessity, right? Because that's
*  how our ancestors survived is by taking care of each other, mitigating risk. You need reputational
*  damage. And if everyone doesn't know everyone, reputational damage is no longer effective.
*  So if you, let's say you go and you're a good hunter and you kill an antelope and then you don't
*  share it and you just keep it for yourself, that's not going to go over real well with a hunter
*  gatherer group. You're going to be ridiculed, chastised, maybe expelled from the group,
*  maybe have a hunting accident and die because that hoarding selfish behaviour is extremely
*  taboo in a hunter gatherer society. Whereas, you know, you look at our society where reputational
*  damage is no longer functional outside of your group of friends, as long as you're good to your
*  friends, your golfing buddies, you can screw the rest of the world. You can not pay your contractors
*  for years and become president. Everyone in New York, I worked in real estate in New York in the
*  80s, everyone knew who that guy was and what he was up to and you couldn't trust him. He was full
*  of shit and he ripped everybody off. But that's how business works in New York. Even the company
*  I was working for is really interesting to see how your leverage increased when you owed somebody
*  a lot of money. You know, there's that truism, if you owe someone five bucks, you have a problem,
*  if you owe them a million bucks, they have a problem. You know, you really see that.
*  But yeah, I think it's 150 is the cutoff for how many people we can keep track of, I think.
*  Dunbar's numbers proved to be pretty accurate.
*  Pete Well, it seems to be what we evolved to sort of be accustomed to, right?
*  Pete Well, that's the neocortex. Dunbar was looking at the brain anatomy of different primates
*  and by looking at the proportion of a neocortex to the rest of the brain, he predicted the maximum
*  social size of those primates of each of the species. And that's how he came to the estimate
*  of 150 for humans. And then they went and looked at people, they did data collection.
*  That's so crazy. The physical size of something like that, that there's a direct correlation,
*  like the direct correlation between the size of primates' testicles and the amount of
*  promiscuous females in the area.
*  Pete You've read Sex of Dawn, Joe.
*  Joe Yes, I have!
*  Pete Finally!
*  Joe I read it a long time ago, man. I read it a long time ago.
*  Pete I'm thinking I might do, I did the audiobook of Civilized to Death,
*  which I really enjoyed that process. I'm thinking I might do a 10th anniversary
*  director's cut audiobook of Sex of Dawn.
*  Joe Did you do the audio version?
*  Pete No.
*  Joe Who did?
*  Pete Actors.
*  Joe Oh, yuck.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe Oh, yuck. My friend Steve Rinella, he wrote a book on Buffalo, the American Buffalo,
*  you know, just the history of Buffalo in this country. And someone else wrote it and he finally
*  got the rights back and he did it himself now. But it just killed him. Because the person who
*  read it was like a soap opera actor.
*  Pete Right.
*  Joe Had no connection to the material at all.
*  Pete And in Sex of Dawn, there's a lot of jokes and, you know, sort of rye asides and stuff.
*  And the people who read it, they don't get it. They didn't get the humor. So, it's just the
*  straight ahead, it's as if, you know, someone took your comedy material and just read it in a
*  monotone. It's like, come on.
*  Joe That's called criticizing me in a blog.
*  Pete That's what he'd do when someone takes it and just puts it in quotes like that.
*  Joe Yeah, good point. Yeah, there's no delivery there. There's no voice. It's, yeah. Yeah,
*  I'm looking forward to that. And I think I'm gonna, I don't know if Steve did this or not,
*  but I think I'm gonna, as I said, a director's cut. So, I'll, you know, when I read a paragraph
*  that reminds me of something or, you know, what I thought when I wrote that or, you know, my dad
*  really wanted me to include that phrase or, you know, whatever little asides. So, there'll be
*  some commentary as well, I think.
*  Pete Yeah, that's a good move.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Pete David Goggins had a really interesting way he did his. He did his book where he actually
*  didn't read it. He had a friend read it. And then in between paragraphs, they discussed all the
*  different events that happened that he talked about and he gave other details that weren't in
*  the book. So, the audiobook is essentially like an audiobook slash podcast.
*  Joe Yeah. Yeah, so, you're not just getting a reading of the book, you're getting bonus
*  material as well. Yeah.
*  Pete It's really good. It's really good. That's, yeah, I mean, there's no rules of that kind of
*  stuff. You know, it's your book. You can kind of do whatever you want. You could even talk about
*  how you feel now about that chapter. You could always do that.
*  Joe What I would change.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Pete Or how you feel about the material itself and how you interact with the facts that you
*  uncovered versus before. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I don't listen to audiobooks much, but in the van last summer, I listened to the Keith
*  Richards autobiography. Yeah, it was interesting. He reads like the beginning and then this actor
*  who sounds like him, you know, has the same accent, reads most of it. And then Johnny
*  Depp reads a couple of chapters and then Keith comes back at the end.
*  Joe Well, that was one of the weird things about fear and loathing in Las Vegas was Johnny Depp
*  reading Hunter Thompson. And then in a way, you know, honestly did a better job of reading
*  Hunter Thompson than Hunter Thompson has done reading Hunter Thompson. You know, there's that
*  famous speech about being there at the end of the 60s and watching the waves pull back.
*  Pete Sure.
*  Joe You know that?
*  Pete It crested at the Rocky Mountains and then rolled back into the sea.
*  Joe Yeah. That's a fantastic speech, but the way Johnny Depp said it was better.
*  Pete Yeah. Have you ever seen Breakfast with Hunter?
*  Joe Yes.
*  Pete Do you remember he freaks out about that particular passage because, who was it, Alex?
*  Joe Well, they were going to animate it.
*  Pete They were going to animate it. Yeah, and he fucking pulls out the gun and kicks him off
*  the property and totally loses his shit. You're going to take the best thing I've ever written
*  and make it a fucking cartoon. Yeah. Oh my God.
*  Joe Yeah, it's amazing. That guy used to go off. He was so crazy.
*  Pete Did you ever meet him?
*  Joe No. Angry. Angry that I never met him.
*  Pete Yeah. Yeah.
*  Joe I would have loved to have met him.
*  Pete Yeah, and you probably, there were probably a few years there where you could have.
*  Joe I could have. Fuck.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe There's a few people. Dick Gregory, he's one that I really wish I met. I would have loved to
*  talk to him about what it was like to show the Kennedy assassination footage on Geraldo Rivera
*  like 10 plus years after the fact. You know, the Zapruder film?
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe He introduces the Zapruder film to the world.
*  Pete Really?
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Pete Dick Gregory is like a black comedian.
*  Joe Yeah, slash activist.
*  Pete Right. Yeah. I remember him.
*  Joe Yeah, he brought the Zapruder film to Geraldo Rivera and they played the Kennedy assassination
*  on television.
*  Pete Oh shit. It hadn't been seen publicly.
*  Joe No. Not only had it not been seen publicly, I believe Time magazine owned it. I think they
*  bought the rights to it to see if that's true. And they shelved it for, I want to say, 12 years.
*  It was like 75 when it aired on television, somewhere in that range. And you know, the
*  assassination was 63.
*  Pete Was it 63? Yeah.
*  Joe I think it was 63.
*  Pete I was born in 62. Yeah, I guess it was right after I was born.
*  Joe And so, no one had seen his head go back into the left.
*  Pete Until that footage and then people were like, wait, what the f***?
*  Joe Really?
*  Joe Which doesn't necessarily –
*  Pete So, how did Dick Gregory get the rights?
*  Joe I do not remember.
*  Pete Huh.
*  Joe I think, I don't remember.
*  Pete Who else? Have you met Werner Herzog?
*  Joe I've not.
*  Pete Are you into him?
*  Joe Yes.
*  Joe He's a character.
*  Joe Grizzly Man is one of my all time favorite movies.
*  Pete Me too.
*  Joe It's one of the best unintentional comedies ever, but I don't think it's particularly
*  unintentional. There's a f***ing moment in that film where the sheriff, when the sheriff's talking
*  about like the body and carrying the body off in bags, he's like, you know, what did you think?
*  Well, first time I heard about it, I thought he was retarded. And then the kid just has a smash
*  cut to the sheriff's face and I'm f***ing howling. I'm howling laughing. And I'm like,
*  this guy did this on purpose. Like, there's so many cuts in this movie that are so humorous.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe I gotta think that, and Werner Herzog, have you ever heard him on Eric Weinstein's
*  podcast? Brilliant guy. Really interesting, intense guy.
*  Pete And very dark sense of humor.
*  Joe Oh, yeah. Well, that's why I thought, I was like, this motherf***er did this on purpose.
*  He made this a comedy.
*  Pete So, do you think that, what was the name of the character? Timothy Treadwell?
*  Joe Yes.
*  Pete When I watched that movie, my feeling was this guy is closeted, gay dude.
*  Joe 100%.
*  Pete Yeah, you felt that too.
*  Joe No question.
*  He brings up, if I was gay, it would be easy, but I'm not gay. So, he says, because he's like,
*  why can't I find a girl? You know, he's like walking through the woods with this like,
*  lispy, gay way of talking. And he's talking to the, for people who don't know what this
*  documentary is about, it's about a guy named Timothy Treadwell. And Timothy Treadwell was,
*  well, I guess you could say he was a bare expert, but not really. Because the real bare experts were
*  like, this guy doesn't know what the f*** he's doing, he should get out of there. Like, what
*  he's doing is, he doesn't need to protect these bears. He's pretending that he's protecting these
*  bears, he's living with them. I think there was a certain element of it that was suicide by bear.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe I really do. And he was walking through the woods,
*  holding this camcorder, getting film going, if I was gay, it would be so easy, but I'm not gay.
*  Pete Right, talking to the camcorder as his only friend, because he was out there alone for
*  Joe Months at a time.
*  Pete Yeah, every summer.
*  Joe But no one who's not gay says, well, if I was gay, it would be really easy.
*  Pete I've said that a lot, Joe.
*  Joe But unless you're being funny with a friend.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe Like, well, if I was gay, I would just hook up with some dudes.
*  Pete Right.
*  Joe But he's saying it like, why can't I find a girl? If I was gay, it would be so easy. No,
*  wouldn't. You're still living in the woods with monsters. You're gonna get a bunch of gay guys.
*  Gay guys, they want to be in boys town. Okay?
*  Pete They should remake the movie in a bear bar.
*  Joe On Broadway.
*  Joe That would be hilarious. That would be hilarious.
*  Pete Grizzly man.
*  Yeah, instead of doing it with the forest and actual grizzly bears.
*  Joe In the West Village.
*  Pete Yeah, yeah. If I was gay, it would be easy. There's bears everywhere.
*  Joe I went to a bear bar with Andrew Sullivan and Dan Savage.
*  Pete There's actually a bear bar?
*  Joe Oh, there are lots of bear bars.
*  Pete They call them bear bars?
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Pete Oh, that's nice.
*  Joe And for people who don't know what we're talking about, bears are big, hairy, gay guys.
*  Think Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer. They do a podcast called Two Bears, One Cave.
*  Pete Oh, do they? That's hilarious.
*  Joe But neither one of them is gay.
*  Pete But if they were gay, they'd be bears. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Bears.
*  Joe Dan Savage is a trip. I've had him on the podcast.
*  Pete Yeah, yeah, I know. I saw that. That was interesting.
*  Joe He's an interesting guy.
*  Pete He's super smart and funny as shit. And he's armed with nothing but a sense of humor
*  and a great intellect and a big heart. He's –
*  Joe And honesty.
*  Pete Yeah. He's changed the world. He's saved who knows how many lives.
*  You know, he's beautiful. I really like Dan a lot.
*  Joe Yeah, when someone can just be themselves, again, you know, that's who he is.
*  Pete Timothy Treadwell, if he had listened to Dan Savage,
*  everything would be different.
*  Joe Wow, that leap, man, that coming out leap, fuck, it's gotta be so hard for people. I know
*  several guys that are closeted and it's torturous.
*  Torturous to see and one of them, you know, I've talked to him and I was like, just come out,
*  man. No one gives a fuck. We don't care. No one cares. It'll be a giant relief.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe Just, they worry about, especially, you know,
*  actors. They worry about their careers.
*  Pete Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, when your career is more important than the integrity of
*  yourself.
*  Joe But I don't think it hurts you. I don't believe it.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe The only thing that would hurt with actors is
*  leading man roles.
*  Pete Yeah, Rock Hudson kind of guy.
*  Joe Yeah, that's one thing that's fucking real. Like, if you're a,
*  like, I don't know if Tom Cruise is gay, but that's always been this stupid rumor.
*  Pete Right.
*  Joe Let's assume it's true. If he did come out of the closet, man, nobody wants to go see a movie
*  where he's the leading man, he's got a wife and kids. You'd be like, that guy is sucking dick!
*  Pete He would never buy into it. That's like a gay woman, like Jodie Foster.
*  Joe Right.
*  Joe Could easily play a straight woman in a movie and no one would care.
*  Pete Sure. Yeah.
*  Joe But when a gay, that is the fucking glass ceiling in Hollywood. It's one of them, right?
*  When a gay man comes out of the closet, those roles, John Travolta or whatever it is,
*  whoever it would be, I don't know if he's gay either, but if he was, that's the fucking,
*  that's where the buck stops. You cannot be the leading man who's the married guy with kids.
*  Or the hot man who's in a sexual relationship with a woman if we know that you're having sex
*  with men.
*  Pete But then it's funny, right? We can watch straight actors pretend to be gay,
*  like Burbank Mountain. That's no problem.
*  Joe Sure. No problem.
*  Pete Yeah, very strange.
*  Joe Yeah. That's one of the last open prejudices that we all accept because no one's been able to
*  bridge that gap. Except, what's that dude's name that fucking, he's got three names? Little skinny
*  guy, used to be on a sitcom, How I Met Your Mother.
*  Joe Oh, Neil Patrick Harris.
*  Pete Yeah, that guy.
*  Joe Doogie Howser.
*  Pete Doogie Howser, yeah, that guy. He's openly gay and didn't he play a womanizer on a sitcom?
*  Joe I think on How I Met Your Mother, I think I've never watched it.
*  Pete But the thing about sitcoms is they're like plays. Like those kind of sitcoms in front of an
*  audience, they're horse shit. It's not like a movie. It's horse shit. You know it's horse shit,
*  everyone knows it's horse shit.
*  Joe Anything with a laugh track and very suspicious or studio audience?
*  Joe Like Happy Days. Like I love Henry Winkler, but The Fonz. That's horse shit.
*  Pete No way. Is Henry Winkler gay?
*  Joe No, I don't think so. Maybe.
*  Joe I always assumed he was because he was so overcompensating with The Fonz.
*  Joe I think that was the character. You meet him in real life, he is the nicest guy I've ever met.
*  Pete He's in Berry now, right?
*  Joe Is he?
*  Pete Yeah, he plays an acting coach in Berry. I haven't seen it. I hear it's Berry.
*  Joe I've never seen Berry. He's a fly fisherman. He wrote a book on fly fishing. And I think the
*  book's called I Never Met an Idiot on the River because like there's something about fly fishing.
*  Fly fishing is a very weird pursuit because a lot of it is catch and release, which as a person who
*  enjoys the outdoors and enjoys eating fish that I catch, I'm very torn on that activity,
*  that catch and release activity. I know it's fun and I have done it. I get it. But it's weird.
*  It's weird. You're sticking a hook through an animal's face.
*  Pete You know what I was going to say, it traumatizes the fish. It's got to.
*  Joe They got to.
*  Pete How many of them die?
*  Joe Well, fly fishing, very few because you're dealing with barbless hooks for the most part,
*  so it just goes into this cartilage in their mouth they don't really feel and then allegedly
*  don't really feel. I don't know if they feel it. And then they pull it out and they're fine.
*  But there's some catch and release, especially with like three prong barbed hooks where the animals
*  definitely die. They get caught in their gills and they start bleeding from their gills and then you
*  have to release them anyway because in some places the regulation is catch and release.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe But people love doing it. They find like
*  peace, like drifting a fly past this area where the fish is lying dormant and then you pull the
*  fly and then the fish grabs it and then you got them. Oh boy. But you're tapping into this
*  sort of primal reward system that you have in your DNA that makes you want to catch these fish.
*  Pete But it gives you a reason to be out by the river,
*  out in the morning. Normally, it's morning or dusk when the flies are landing.
*  I think a lot, I've been hunting since the last time you and I spoke.
*  Yeah, bow hunting.
*  Joe You went bow hunting?
*  Pete Yeah, yeah. On Hawaii, big island.
*  Joe Oh, didn't you go with Kyle Kingsbury and Ben Greenfield on all kinds?
*  Pete That was a deer, Axis deer trip to Molokai.
*  Joe You have a bow?
*  Pete I do.
*  Joe How often do you practice?
*  Pete Since I went hunting, not much. But before I went, every day. Yeah, I was into it.
*  Joe Did you have a coach?
*  Pete Nope. I had some friends who, you know, helped me out and I watched some, you know,
*  Cam, your buddy. Yeah, I watched some of his videos. But yeah, it was an interesting
*  experience. So, first I went on that trip with, yeah, Peter.
*  Joe Atiyah.
*  Pete Atiyah and Ben Greenfield, like all these podcasts, human optimization guys.
*  Joe Who set that whole thing up?
*  Pete My buddy Kyle Tierman, he's a big wave surfer.
*  Joe Ah, okay.
*  Pete He spends a lot of time in Hawaii and he knows a lot of people there. Healy, Jeff Healy,
*  I think, big surfer dude. Anyway, so, he knew all these people and I guess Aubrey and some other,
*  those guys sort of asked him to hook them up with a trip. And so, he put it all together and then at
*  the last minute, I think Aubrey couldn't go, I think because you were coming down to Austin and
*  he wanted to, you know, coordinate with you or something. So, they said, yo Chris, if you want
*  to go, it's all paid for. And I'm like, helicopters? Hawaii? Fuck yeah.
*  Joe So, did you have to practice leading up to that or were you already shooting a bow?
*  Pete I was already shooting because we had, Kyle and I, Kyle Tierman and I, had already planned a
*  trip for like three weeks after that. So, I was already practicing for that, which was going to
*  be a pig hunting trip on the big island. But then I went on this deer thing, but mainly I went on
*  the deer thing just because it was an opportunity to fly around in helicopters and see Molokai,
*  which is amazing. But I didn't hunt on that because I didn't, honestly, I didn't want to
*  hurt anything, you know. I wanted to…
*  Joe Didn't feel like you were competent enough with it or you didn't want to do it at all?
*  Pete Well, the deer are farther away and they're much harder, they're much more aware and like
*  stalking them is a lot harder. So, I just basically hung out and had a good time.
*  Joe They're so hard.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe That animal, Axis deer, is an animal that evolved to get away from tigers.
*  Pete Right.
*  Joe They're the fastest thing I've ever hunted by far.
*  Pete Super alert.
*  Joe I hunted them with Kam Haines and –
*  Pete On Molokai?
*  Joe No, on Lanai and John Dudley just before you guys went. And we were there between the time we
*  were there and when we were there the last spring, there was 150 hunters that went there to bow hunt.
*  One was successful.
*  Pete Really?
*  Joe Everyone else pulled out a rifle.
*  Pete Huh.
*  Joe Everyone else was like, fuck this. Because you can't get anywhere near those goddamn things
*  without them jumping. But if you can get your stalking skills down or you can sneak up on an
*  Axis deer and kill one with a bow, holy shit. That's black belt level stuff.
*  Well, the dudes I were with, Peter Attia, he got two or three, I remember.
*  Pete He's very, very, very into it. He's a super, super smart guy.
*  Joe Yeah, he is. He's cool. I enjoyed hanging with all those dudes. But then the next,
*  you know, three weeks later, we went, Kyle and me and Simon Rex, I don't know if you know him, he's a
*  actor.
*  Pete Slash comedian.
*  Joe Slash comedian.
*  Joe Dirt nasty.
*  Joe Dirt nasty rapper. Yeah, he's a good friend of mine. Anyway, we went
*  on this pig hunting trip and that was interesting. That was, you know, I wanted to have the
*  experience because I'd never hunted, I'd never killed anything and I eat meat so I felt like I
*  have this, you know, responsibility to have the experience and confront it and all that.
*  And I was actually the first of our group to kill a pig. And it was strange. I didn't feel
*  sad or traumatized. I felt heightened awareness, you know, like,
*  but I, I think I might hunt again. I'm probably, I'm moving to Colorado. I just bought land in
*  Colorado.
*  Pete Oh yeah? What part?
*  Joe Sort of south central. It's a tiny little town. And yeah, it's an interesting area there.
*  But anyway, there's a lot of elk hunting there. And I'll probably do some elk hunting with local
*  people.
*  Pete You gonna do it with a bow again?
*  Joe No, I think I'll use a rifle.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe Cause I think that's the way to go.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Pete Not gonna be completely obsessed and do it every day?
*  Joe I'm not.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe Cause I don't do that.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe And also, I don't, you know, the thing about a bow is, and maybe this is what you're implying
*  here, if you're not really good, the chances of you, of an elk running off or a pig running
*  off with an arrow in its ass and dying a slow horrible death is quite high. If you hit him with
*  a rifle, high powered rifle with a scope, you know, and you're in the right range.
*  Pete You can still wound him, but you're much more competent with a rifle. And it's a better,
*  it's a better meat gathering tool. But good way to talk it, just describe it. And Colorado has,
*  I think twice as many elk as any other state.
*  Joe Really?
*  Pete Yeah. Colorado is one of the best places in the world to elk hunt.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Pete So, that's a good spot if you're looking.
*  Joe And also, you're taking a life, you take an elk, that's a lot of meat. I shot this pig,
*  it was about, you know, it was a yearling, I think. It's not a lot of meat on a pig that size.
*  Pete No.
*  Joe So, yeah, but it was interesting.
*  Pete Are you living in this van? Are you living in the other place?
*  Joe No, I have an apartment. I still have an apartment in LA, but I'm about to give it up,
*  I think.
*  Pete Just to just be a nomad?
*  Joe Yeah, because, I mean, I was in the van all, you know, five months. And it's like,
*  okay, I'm paying rent to what? Like, to leave my clothes there, basically.
*  Pete Right.
*  Joe Like, I don't really need to be doing that.
*  Pete No, I admire that sort of nomad sense of life. I admire it. I don't ever see myself doing it.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Pete But there's a romantic aspect to it that's undeniable.
*  Joe Well, your life's different, man. You have kids, you know, you have a life here that's really
*  you've built over a lot of time, you know? I just got here a few years ago.
*  Joe You're kind of a prisoner to that though, in a certain way. You're a prisoner to
*  all your obligations. There's –
*  Joe Oh, sure.
*  Joe That's one of the things that's romantic about this nomadic thing that you're doing.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Joe It's like, you know, I have to come here. I have a certain amount of podcasts I have to do a
*  week. They're stacking up.
*  Joe But you don't, Joe. You don't.
*  Joe I don't. I don't.
*  Joe I mean, I was thinking that we're talking about the, you know, closeted gay actors. What is money
*  worth if you can't buy your freedom with it? Your freedom to be who you are, right? As a closeted
*  gay person, right? Let's say. What is it good for? I mean, that's the first thing.
*  Joe I think with the closeted gay folks, the real problem is like the feeling that you're going to
*  be rejected if you come out. I think that's entirely different than someone who gets wrapped
*  up in jobs. Like, one of the things that I could say about the jobs that I have is that I really
*  do enjoy them. Like, I'm enjoying this conversation. I love talking to people.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Joe I love doing stand up. Love it. And I still enjoy doing the UFC. Those are my three jobs.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Joe And I don't do the UFC as much as I used to.
*  Joe Would you do them all if you were making 100 grand a year total?
*  Joe I mean, I certainly obviously could live off 100 grand a year.
*  Joe Yeah.
*  Joe If that's what I made a year.
*  Joe So the money isn't what makes them fun.
*  Joe No.
*  Joe It's the thing itself.
*  Joe Definitely. Well, that's what's made the money. What's made the money is my, I mean,
*  I think, right? I think it's my enjoyment of the things that's made them interesting. Like,
*  one of the things about podcasts, and I think there is a parallel and stand up, is that genuine
*  enthusiasm, like real legitimate enthusiasm is contagious. And if you're genuinely interested
*  in talking to people and genuinely curious, it's interesting to listen to.
*  Joe Right.
*  Joe And, you know, you do your best to get out of your own way, and you do your best,
*  I do my best to not be annoying. And I fuck up sometimes. There's no if, hands or butts about
*  it. I'm a human being and I've done-
*  Joe But you cop to it when you do, which I think is another thing that's endearing. And
*  I mean, you're a really interesting case, as I'm sure you know. And I've watched you,
*  even since I've known you, like your profile has moved much closer to mainstream American,
*  you know, popular. You were mentioned on fucking Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago.
*  Pete Yeah, where?
*  Joe Right.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Joe You know, and there's some article about Joe, where was it, in Harper's or the New Yorker's,
*  something recently that I read, like super mainstream. But you're really interesting
*  because you're like this man's man, but you're also vulnerable, you know? You're also like,
*  you admit when you fuck up. Like you had someone, the Twitter guy on and you're like, yeah,
*  Pete Jack Dorsey.
*  Joe I wasn't prepared, I fucked it up, and you had him back. That's cool. That's,
*  and it's probably, I don't know, is it hard for you to maintain that kind of humility when
*  you're getting all this pressure and opportunities and all this stuff coming at you?
*  Joe No, I don't think so. No, I think that's just being honest. You know, if you, I mean,
*  I think if I'd stopped, if I fucked up and I stopped admitting that I was fucking up,
*  it would all go off the rails. I couldn't maintain who I am. I would be thinking about
*  it all the time. You'd be like,
*  Pete Back to the closeted gay dude, right?
*  Joe Yeah, you'd be a closeted, you'd be a bullshit artist.
*  Pete Yeah, exactly.
*  Joe Yeah, you'd just be pretending you're cooler than you are. I think
*  part of being a human being is making mistakes. It's a messy thing to be a person,
*  you know? And I mean, I'm also big on forgiveness. And I think you have to be,
*  because human beings are fallible and like we're saying, we vary from moment to the next.
*  And to try to hold someone to who they were six months ago or a year ago or five years ago or
*  what they said or what they did and not accept it and hold a grudge, to me, that's crazy. I don't,
*  like, do you want people to do that to you? What kind of life is that? What kind of civilization
*  are we creating where people hold grudges and don't forgive people for things of the past?
*  But you also have to be able to forgive yourself. That's, I struggle with that way more,
*  believe it or not, than I struggle with forgiving other people. I can forgive other people pretty
*  easy for whatever reason. I've always been able to, you know? I've always been able to.
*  So what's the difference?
*  I'm super self-critical and I have definitely some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder
*  that allows me to get really good at things because I obsess. You know, it's probably unhealthy,
*  but I manage it. But like the mania that goes on in my mind, I just figured out a way to put it to
*  use. It's like, okay, I got this fucking engine. Like, what do I stick it on? Let me stick a thing
*  in there and I could drill a hole with that instead of just having it going,
*  ahhhhhhhhh, which a lot of people do. A lot of people don't find a focus
*  for whatever mania they have going on in their mind. So I've found various things.
*  That's one of the reasons why I don't ever see myself not doing anything. I don't have enough
*  time. That's my issue. There's a lot of things that I love to do that I just don't have the time for.
*  Pete How old are you?
*  Jared 52.
*  Pete Do you feel like you're sort of figuring things out?
*  Jared Always. Yeah.
*  I mean, like, I have this sense, 57, I have this sense that like, I don't know, like, I'm,
*  I finally learned to dance and the party's almost over.
*  Pete Yes!
*  Jared You know what I mean?
*  Pete That's a great way to say it. That's hilarious.
*  Jared It's like, I'm finally figuring this shit out and I'm almost 60.
*  Pete Well, I remember when I was like 26, 25, and when I first came out here, I remember thinking,
*  boy, by the time I'm 52, I'll fucking everything solved. There's arbitrary numbers that we have in
*  our head of who you should be at 50 or 60 or whatever the number is. And that's, you're just
*  alive, man. You're just alive. And while you're alive, you better forget about all those numbers.
*  Pete I remember thinking like, the year 2000, when the year 2000 comes, like, what's that
*  going to be like? Wow, I'm going to be so old and yeah.
*  Jared Dude, it's almost 2020.
*  Pete I know.
*  Jared It's going to be 2020 in a couple months. That's crazy. That is such a nutty number.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Pete Yeah, well, that's why I love living in the van, dude. I mean, I've, you know, so much since
*  you and I sat, I don't know, a year or so since we've seen each other. My dad's died, I'm living in
*  the van, like, this book's come out, like, all this stuff's happening. But I've spent most of
*  the time sitting by a campfire looking at the stars, you know?
*  Jared It's fucking, the times that I get outside, like, when I elk hunt every year, and I spend
*  time, particularly in Utah, in the mountains, the place that we go, it's just, it's cleansing
*  in a way that is so hard to describe. It's so hard to describe what it's like just to be out
*  there in the woods and be in the forest and be with the wild animals and, you know, it's –
*  Pete Your home.
*  Jared Yeah.
*  Pete That's what this book's about. I don't mean to push the conversation to the book, but
*  that's why I wrote the book. Like, we are designed by evolution to live –
*  Jared Civilized to death, available now.
*  Pete Available at bookstores.
*  Jared Bookstores.
*  Pete Near you.
*  Jared And Amazon and all that other stuff.
*  Pete We're designed to live in that world.
*  Jared Yes.
*  Pete So, that's why it feels so good. That's why golf courses look the way they do.
*  Jared Mm hmm.
*  Pete You know, even fucking, you know, old executives love being out there on the grass
*  and the water and the undulating hills. It's the African savanna.
*  Jared Wow.
*  Pete I know, even when it's manicured, right? It still feels good.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared It still feels good to be connected to nature. It feels good to be on a lake.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared Lakes are the best, man. To sit on the dock of a lake, like, there's a feeling of like,
*  you know, you look out, you see trees. You ever been to Coeur d'Alene?
*  Pete Yeah, I was there this summer.
*  I haven't, but a friend of mine has a house there and I saw a picture of the water and like,
*  you look all the way down like 100 feet deep, down you see the bottom, like it's like a piece of glass.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared This is bananas.
*  Pete Yeah, I didn't take a shower for about three months.
*  Jared You must have smelled amazing.
*  Pete I smelled great because every morning I jumped in a river.
*  Jared Oh.
*  Pete It was, you know, every once-
*  Jared That counts.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared That counts, though.
*  Pete Oh, yeah.
*  Jared Did you use soap or not?
*  Pete No, I haven't used soap in a decade.
*  Jared Oh, Jesus. But you smell okay. How weird.
*  Pete Yeah. My microbiome is working. It's fine.
*  There's articles that have been written about that by people that say you shouldn't use soap.
*  Pete Yeah. No, a lot of them because you're disrupting your microbiome.
*  Jared Yeah.
*  Pete You don't, I mean, I use deodorant.
*  Jared There's Coeur d'Alene.
*  Pete Yeah. Sandpoint's really nice too. Idaho's great.
*  Jared Idaho's gorgeous. I love Boise.
*  Pete Yeah, and Montana, western Montana is insane.
*  Jared Oh, yeah, man. Yeah. Look how pretty that is though. God damn that lake. And when you have
*  a boat on a lake, it's like you have a car but there's no road. Everything is a road. It's all
*  flat. So, you can go wherever the fuck you want.
*  Pete Same thing with airplanes. It's amazing what you can do.
*  Jared Three dimensional. That's even crazier.
*  Pete You into flying?
*  Jared Well, my friend Bill has a helicopter license.
*  Pete Oh, yeah. Oh, Bill Burr. Yeah.
*  Jared Yeah. He took me around his helicopter.
*  Pete That's pretty wild.
*  Jared I thought about that. I was like, that might be a cool thing to get into but –
*  Pete That's hard.
*  Jared He spent, yeah, he spent a lot of time learning how to fly.
*  Pete And it's expensive.
*  Jared Mm hmm. Yeah.
*  But a single engine airplane, you can die a hundred grand, you get a decent single engine
*  airplane and you can go wherever you want. My uncle has an amphibious plane so he lands on lakes.
*  Pete Oh, wow.
*  Jared Yeah. And he used to –
*  Pete Could he land on ground too?
*  Jared Yeah. So, that's amphibious. So, it has wheels and floats.
*  Pete Does you have to switch things up or?
*  Jared Yeah.
*  Pete So, you have to change out the –
*  Jared No, no. You just push a button, the wheels retract.
*  Pete Oh, no shit?
*  Jared Yeah. He forgot once and flipped it.
*  Pete Oh, no!
*  Jared So, you don't want to forget.
*  Pete How many people fly drunk?
*  Jared Yeah.
*  Pete I bet they do.
*  Jared Yeah.
*  Pete Right?
*  Jared Well, if the weather's good.
*  Pete Wasn't that like a Patrick Swayze thing, like before he kicked the bucket?
*  Pete It was.
*  Pete What are you laughing about? What are you laughing about? You're laughing about something?
*  Huh?
*  Jared Harrison Ford, I think.
*  Pete Harrison Ford? Oh, that's right.
*  Jared Right. Was he drunk?
*  Pete Harrison Ford might have been. Might have been.
*  Jared I don't know.
*  Pete Might have been. Or it might – maybe he's an old dude. Old
*  dudes look drunk all the time.
*  Jared And babies.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared That's a great way to achieve privacy too, right? Like, if you're a guy like Harrison
*  Ford, I mean, that guy, it must be hard for that guy to go anywhere.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared Right? It's probably real hard for him to go to a regular airport.
*  Pete Yeah. Yeah, I've got the perfect amount of fame. I was thinking about this today on
*  the airplane flying down from Portland. I'm like, I was in the front row so I had extra
*  leg room but I wasn't in business class. That's where I am in fame. I want to stay right there.
*  I got a little extra leg room.
*  Jared Right. You could be normal, stretch your legs out.
*  Pete Some people recognize me but they all like me. If you don't like me,
*  you don't know who the hell I am.
*  Jared That's nice.
*  Pete Yeah. So, you're at a different level. There are people who recognize you who are like,
*  eh, fuck that guy Joe. Me? Nothing. I mean, you get mostly love, I'm sure.
*  Jared Remarkably though, most people are nice. Yeah. Even, you know,
*  even people that don't like you, they don't really know you.
*  Pete Right.
*  Jared If they knew you.
*  Pete It's some image they have.
*  Jared I'm nice. If you know me, you meet me, I guarantee we're probably going to get along.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared And if we don't, I'm going to work hard to make it not uncomfortable.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared You know, it's just, the thing about people liking people and not liking people,
*  a lot of it is this severely limited way of communicating, especially when it's one way,
*  right? If you're putting out a podcast or you're putting out books and they're reading your shit
*  but they don't get to interact at all, that builds resentment. There's a lot of weird
*  resentment that people develop when they listen to you and they don't get to interact. Like,
*  say, especially someone like me, who's always talking shit, right? I talk shit for a living,
*  basically, and I'm always giving my opinions and some people have a,
*  probably, maybe even a strong point that I probably even agree with them
*  and they don't get to say anything. So, they're sitting at home listening like,
*  fuck this guy, I'm tired of this bull.
*  Pete Yeah, you occupy space in their lives.
*  Jared Yes.
*  Pete But they don't get to interact.
*  Pete You owe them some things.
*  Jared Yes.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared Yes.
*  Pete That makes sense.
*  Jared Yes, makes sense.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared It's a crude way of communicating.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared These one way methods of communication are very crude.
*  Pete Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I was thinking, my buddy Simon and I were in a restaurant in Venice
*  and the woman recognized me and like, oh, I love your podcast, and gave me your number,
*  and I was like, yeah, I'll give her a call sometime, and Simon's like, dude, I would never do
*  that. You never, you know, interact with your fans, you know. And then, I was like, no, but Simon,
*  you don't get it, she actually knows me. Like, in Simon's case, like, he was in Scary Movie 3,
*  4, 5, he was, you know, he plays these characters. So, when people are like, yo, Simon, like,
*  they don't know him.
*  Pete Right.
*  Jared They, he's this, the face they recognize, but they don't know the dude.
*  Pete Right.
*  So, it's a different kind of thing. I really, like, the van trips, the Vanthropology thing,
*  I'll say, okay, I'm going to be in, you know, Boise at this beer pub Thursday at 8, and people
*  show up, 50, 100 people show up.
*  Pete Really?
*  Jared Oh, yeah. But it's mainly so they can meet each other.
*  Pete So, when you do this, do you do live shows?
*  Jared No.
*  Pete Do you do live shows?
*  Jared I've never done a live show. I've done, like, Duncan's a couple times with him.
*  Pete Oh, okay.
*  Jared You know, we've done, we did the, what was it, a couple years ago, we did the keynote
*  at the Float Conference in Portland.
*  Pete Ha, that's hilarious.
*  Jared That was a good audience.
*  Pete Oh, yeah, that's a tuned in group of people, right?
*  Jared But I don't do the shows, I just –
*  Pete Keynote at a Float Conference.
*  Jared With Duncan, yeah, it was great.
*  Pete Oh my god, that sounds perfect.
*  Jared Yeah.
*  Pete Oh, that's hilarious.
*  Jared But it's really just to build community. That's what I want to do. I want them to meet
*  each other because they're all beautiful weirdos.
*  Pete Right, right. Hopefully.
*  Jared Yeah, they are. I've never met anyone through the podcast that I didn't really actually like.
*  Pete What kind of numbers do you get? Like, what kind of downloads? How many episodes?
*  Jared You know, it's hard to know, but probably 50,000 an episode, something like that.
*  Pete That's perfect.
*  Jared Yeah.
*  Pete That's a good number.
*  Jared Between 50 and 100, like, you know, when you and Duncan were on, when we were doing the
*  shrimp parade thing, it would, you know, peak because it's you guys.
*  Pete Do you use advertising?
*  Jared I didn't. For five years, it was listener supported only.
*  Pete Patreon type deal?
*  Jared Yeah. And then this friend of mine who has this company, Mudwater,
*  he was sort of launching that and he was like, dude, I want to advertise on your podcast. I'm
*  like, yeah, I love you, buddy, but I don't do that. And then he sent me an email that,
*  email chain where he was negotiating with another podcast that has roughly the same audience numbers
*  as mine. And I was like, really? I'm leaving that much on the table? Fuck. So, I started,
*  at this point, I only do ads for companies that I really like and that I use their stuff.
*  So, I don't do, you know, I don't have a broker or any of that stuff.
*  Jared Yeah, I think the subscription model, like when people are paying like a paywall,
*  the problem is the growth is so limited. So, then you could either just do it for free and put it
*  out there and maybe just sell books or sell t-shirts or, you know, in my case, tickets to
*  shows, that would work. I'm going to be in Cleveland this weekend and Detroit.
*  Pete Nice.
*  Jared Ladies and gentlemen.
*  Pete What's it like to play Detroit? Is Detroit coming back?
*  Jared I love Detroit. I love Detroit. They're good people. They're fun people. They're happy
*  there. Detroit is not necessarily coming back to where it used to be. It's a bit like, what is
*  a comeback? You know? When you get back in shape and you're 70, guess what? You're never going to
*  be who you were when you were 20. You know, it's not, never going to be what it was. I mean,
*  it was the richest city in America at one point in time, right? You know, during the peak of
*  automobile production, I believe it was the rich or one of the richest cities in America.
*  And it's a far cry from that now. And it's strange when you drive through the town and you see these
*  boarded up buildings and factories with other broken windows and just, you could buy a house
*  for like a hundred bucks. Like, it's weird. It's weird. But then there's also a lot of like
*  craft restaurants and these businesses that are building up and these hippies that have kind of
*  moved in and, you know, they're kind of, you know, making stuff there and there's a lot of cool shit.
*  Pete It's cheap enough to get in and do stuff.
*  Yeah, yeah. Which is, you know, if you're a young person growing up there, you know, like,
*  you can make something happen. And with the internet, your ability to establish a business
*  and your ability to, you know, to actually get something off the ground is so much different
*  than it ever has been before. And people love a good comeback story. So Detroit,
*  like a bunch of Detroit made things could be exciting for people. Like, yeah, look at that,
*  Detroit, not by that. Yeah, it's Detroit made. You know, there's a company called Shinola.
*  Have you ever heard of it?
*  Pete Yeah, the watches.
*  Pete Really nice watches. American made watches. They make a bunch of other stuff too, like bags,
*  leather goods, things along those lines. But one of the things they proudly say is made in Detroit.
*  And they make cool shit, you know, so there's something to that, you know. But the place I'm
*  working at is the Fox Theater and it's just like really fucking cool old theater. And what's
*  interesting, there's columns. And it was back when people used to be able to smoke,
*  they smoked in there so much that all the columns are like, they have that orangey nicotine sort of
*  tint to them. But one of the columns was replaced. So this one column is like clear and smooth and
*  clean. And the other ones are like fucking orangey. Like you could, it seems like you can go up to
*  them with a butter knife and just scrape the nicotine off of them, you know, but beautiful
*  old building that was made way, way, way back in the day. And they said that when it was first
*  made, it was one of the only buildings in Detroit that had air conditioning. So people would go to
*  see movies there and they would pay to see movies just as they could fall asleep. They'd go in there
*  and just the cool air and they'd fall asleep during the summer. Because you know, people would just be
*  sweltering in the heat of the summer. Pete I've done that in Bangkok.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete Just gone to a cinema just to get out of the heat.
*  Nice. I fucking love Thailand, man. I really, really enjoyed Thailand when I was there.
*  Pete You went recently.
*  Pete Yeah, last summer. It's like people are so nice.
*  Pete Food's great.
*  Pete Amazing.
*  Pete It's the one country I'm comfortable recommending to just about anyone.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete Because the sort of confluence of convenience and safety and ease and it's still exotic and
*  really interesting and very foreign. You know, I wouldn't recommend India to everyone or Indonesia,
*  but Thailand is like, whatever your tolerance is, you'll find something there that works for you.
*  Pete Yeah, I know a lot of fighters who've gone there for camps, for training camps and wound up
*  either moving there or starting camps there or starting gyms there. They just love it so much.
*  Pete It's a good life.
*  Pete I feel like it's part of their home.
*  Pete Yeah. I've been there a lot, probably 10 times over the years.
*  Pete Yeah. It's real cheap too in terms of like food, eating, lodging.
*  Pete The best food in the world as far as I'm concerned. Thai food.
*  Pete I love spicy food so to me it's excellent.
*  Pete And it's balanced, it's interesting. It's not just like blast your face off spice. It's
*  really nice. Did you go to Laos at all?
*  Pete No.
*  Pete That's an interesting place. Really good. Yeah.
*  Pete I heard Vietnam's amazing.
*  Pete You know, Bourdain's one of his favorite places to go.
*  Pete Yeah, he loved it. I know. I was there for three months in Vietnam. I didn't dig it that
*  much. There's some really beautiful places but I found, I was traveling with Casilda, my wife,
*  who's dark skinned and there's a lot of racism. She got harassed a lot because everyone assumed
*  that she was a local and with me makes her a prostitute and dark skin makes her low class.
*  So, there was a lot, she got, a dude punched her.
*  Pete A guy punched her?
*  Pete Yeah, an adolescent kid ran up, we were on a motorbike in this rice paddies and this kid just
*  ran up and punched her in the back and then ran off. Yeah.
*  Pete Wow. A young kid?
*  Pete Yeah, like 15 or so. Yeah, it was pretty heavy. She got, she got like physically accosted
*  three times in Vietnam.
*  Pete How long were you there?
*  Pete Three months.
*  Pete Fuck.
*  Pete Yeah. Yeah. So, I didn't dig Vietnam that much. Then we got to Laos and it was,
*  and there was like, I mean, it's a tough country. They've had, I mean, shit storm been going on
*  there since the 40s, you know, or even before that, the French occupation and all that.
*  So, I'm not blaming anyone.
*  Pete Isn't that a big part of the heroin trade, Laos as well?
*  Pete It was during the Vietnam War, yeah. Now, I think heroin is more coming out of Afghanistan.
*  Pete Afghanistan, yeah.
*  Pete And Mexico, you know, they've got the cartels.
*  Pete Dude, do you see the fucking shit that's going down?
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete There's where the government and the armies have backed down and let the cartels run everything.
*  Pete Yeah, well, they took El Chapo's son back, right?
*  Pete Yes. How insane is that? I mean, how is that going to play out?
*  Pete Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. I'm going to Mexico in a couple months,
*  but I'm going to a different part of this.
*  Pete Where are you going?
*  Pete Chapas, way down south on the border with Guatemala. I really love it down there. There's a
*  town called San Cristobal de Las Casas. It's up in the Ponderosa Pines, maybe 4,000 feet.
*  It's beautiful. Indian villages around and they come down on market day. I'm going to go down
*  there and work on another book.
*  Pete What are you writing now?
*  Pete You know, it's kind of under wraps because I talked about this book way too much and it
*  slowed me down. So, I'm…
*  Pete Is it all about Neil Young's bed?
*  Pete Can we cut that out? I can get a guy in trouble for saying that.
*  Pete You remember the first time I was on this show, how fucked up it was at the beginning?
*  Pete What did you do?
*  Pete Were you even aware of that?
*  Pete What happened?
*  Pete So, the first time I came on the show, I didn't know you, right? And I didn't know anything
*  about you because I was living in Spain. And Duncan, I had done Duncan shows. The first time
*  I'd done a podcast, I didn't know what a podcast was. I came to LA to visit my parents. I had this
*  email from Duncan, I'm a comedian, you want to do a podcast? I'm like, sure, never met a comedian.
*  Don't know what a podcast is. So, I did it. We had a good time. And after, he's like,
*  you know, I'd love to introduce you to my friend Joe Rogan. I think you guys would get along and
*  you could do his podcast. I'd never heard of Joe Rogan, right? No insult intended. I just,
*  I lived in Spain. I never watched Fear Factor. Your whole thing was happening over here. I didn't
*  know about it. And then I went back to Spain. I was like, okay, Duncan's friend Joe does this
*  podcast in his living room the way Duncan does, I assumed, right? And I went back to Spain and I
*  was talking to my buddy Voodoo, who's a tattoo artist. And he's like, so how was LA? I was like,
*  yeah, cool. I did a podcast with this comedian. It was really fun and interesting. And he's like,
*  oh, you should do Joe Rogan's podcast. I'm like, dude, how do you know Duncan's friend Joe, right?
*  It was this whole weird thing. He's like, no, dude, Joe Rogan's. So, I tried to tell you that story
*  the first time I came. And the point of the story is I'm an idiot. I don't know what's going on,
*  right? I'm oblivious. But we got to the point where I said I didn't know you. And you were like,
*  so what did you do? Google me? And I was like, well, not really. And then we had to do a sound
*  check or you had to do an ad or something. And it got, the story got interrupted. And I felt like
*  you thought I was trying to diss you or something.
*  Pete Slauson I definitely didn't.
*  Yeah. Well, I was paranoid. Then you lit up a joint and you passed the joint around.
*  Pete Slauson The paranoia.
*  Pete Slauson And I'm like, fuck, if I don't hit this joint,
*  then I'm confirmed asshole here. So, I hit the joint even though I hadn't smoked any weed in months.
*  And it was this like California weed. I'm holding, literally, I remember,
*  I'm holding the bottom of my chair trying not to fall out of the chair. And we start talking and
*  I'm telling the story about a dude that I had met on an airplane. And he was super into Sex at Dawn
*  and then we were going to do a movie together and whatever. And then his wife like took the book
*  away from him. Do you remember all that? And then I was just like, oh, fuck, I shouldn't have told
*  that story. You know, this whole, I'm fucking everything up. And I said to you, can we just,
*  because we're like five minutes in at this point. And I was like, Joe, can we just like cut this and
*  start over? And you looked at me and you said, is live, bitch?
*  Pete Slauson You don't remember any of that.
*  Pete Slauson I do now.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson I do now.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, man.
*  Pete Slauson I knew the guy.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, yeah, exactly. And you were like, say his name. And then I said his name.
*  You're like, no, he's a friend of mine. And I was like, oh, shit, I shouldn't have said his name
*  and the whole thing. Yeah. And then I left, Casildo was here in the studio and we left,
*  we got in the car and I said, man, was that as awkward as I felt? And she's like, that's the
*  worst I've ever seen you.
*  Pete Slauson You were great!
*  Pete Slauson Oh, shit.
*  Pete Slauson Establish a great friendship.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson No issues at all.
*  Pete Slauson I don't know, maybe you enjoyed watching me suffer, I don't know.
*  Pete Slauson No, I do enjoy watching people get too high.
*  It's not a suffer thing. It's like, I've been there. It's a commiseration thing, I think.
*  I, one of the things about these sober October things is you realize like, there's so many things
*  that are so much easier when you're not high. You know, it's almost like you handicap yourself
*  by getting baked. Like, I was talking to Red Band, Brian Red Band about this, like, we were
*  talking about like how the early days of podcasts, we would get obliterated before we do the podcast,
*  like, for years, like up until like maybe 2013 or 14. Like, we would, I had a volcano,
*  you know what that is? Those vaporizers, it fills up this bag and you take these big deep hits off
*  this THC vapor and then as soon as you put the bag down and we're like, okay, let's get going,
*  let's start the podcast and be like, oh my god, what have we done? And it was this feeling every
*  time we did the podcast was, oh my god, what have we done? And you'd be in the middle of saying
*  something and as you're saying, like, what am I talking about? I don't even know what I'm talking
*  about. And then you would say, oh no, no, no, it's not that. Like, you would screw things up,
*  you'd get scrambled in your head. When there's no pot at all, that never happens. Like, you,
*  I mean, you might make mistakes, but you know what you're talking about while you're talking
*  about it. Like, when you're really, really high like that, there's a lot of times where you're
*  talking about stuff where you literally don't know exactly what you're talking about.
*  It's like that split personality thing we were talking about earlier.
*  Marijuana has so many pros, but it's got some cons, like everything in life, like love and
*  good things and bad things and food and sleep. There's pros and cons. And then the cons become
*  very evident when you're not doing it. I still think every time I do these Sober October things,
*  I always think, well, I'm going to cut back. I'm going to cut back on some weed. And I think I did
*  last year, like after October, I was like, I am not going to do it as much as I used to do it.
*  Do you drink?
*  Yeah, a little bit.
*  Like wine, beer?
*  I love wine with meals. Yeah. Yeah. If I have a nice meal, I love a glass of red wine.
*  Yeah.
*  I like a cold beer on a hot day. Love that.
*  Dude.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that.
*  Yeah. I lived in, you know, I lived in Spain 25 years or something. And like over there,
*  wine is like water. You have wine with breakfast.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. It's just part of life. It's like olive oil. It's on everything.
*  That's funny because I just saw a restaurant, I was at a restaurant, I was using the bathroom
*  and they had a sign up that said a meal without wine is called breakfast. So that's Italian.
*  Yeah.
*  In Spain, they're like, fuck it.
*  Yeah. I mean, not everyone's doing it, but workers, like you'll see workers in a bar,
*  they have their sandwiches and a glass of wine.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Some coffee with little Baileys in it.
*  Nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with it if you can handle it.
*  Well, you know, when I got to Spain, I remember talking to people like, wow, alcohol is everywhere.
*  And it's not like liquor licenses here. Like every cafe is serving wine and beer and whatever.
*  You can just sell it.
*  It's everywhere. Yeah. And kids are there and it's just, you know, it's not set aside.
*  And the Spanish guy said to me, you know, in Spain, we have many alcoholics, but no drunks.
*  And it's true. Like you don't see people puking in the street, you know, raging,
*  drunken lunatics like, you know, in the US.
*  What about like sports events like soccer games?
*  They sell beer, full strength beer. I don't remember if they sell wine.
*  And yeah, I mean, Barcelona is a special place. I don't know what it's like in Madrid. I never
*  went to a soccer game in Madrid, but Barcelona, the Catalans are sort of dry, very self-contained
*  people. So, you know, there's no raging and right now there's rioting going on,
*  but that's a political thing.
*  What are they rioting over?
*  Catalan independence.
*  Yeah.
*  Didn't something happen today in Hong Kong?
*  I don't know.
*  Something-
*  I've been out of the loop today.
*  Hong Kong, the Hong Kong protests have been going on for so long now.
*  It's months and months and months. It's like-
*  Intense. And Chile now too, and Santiago Chile people are rioting.
*  Yeah, shit's getting interesting. It's heating up.
*  Yeah. It's a strange time to be alive. Really is. Across the board.
*  Yeah. I feel like we're at an inflection point.
*  What's going on? Hong Kong frees murder suspect to whose case led to protests. Oh, interesting.
*  Well, they're trying to take the air out of it.
*  I feel- you ever read Joseph Campbell?
*  Yeah.
*  So, the hero with a thousand faces, his observation that societies all over the world have basically
*  the same origin myth, which is the Odyssey, right? It's the person goes out and has all these
*  challenges and faces their fears and learns all the stuff and then returns home with the knowledge
*  that they've gained and they realize that what they were looking for all the time is actually
*  home, right?
*  Right.
*  I feel like as a species, we're at the point in that journey where we're turning toward home.
*  That's my- that's sort of the overriding narrative of this book, that where we are now is we've
*  learned enough that we can go back to or go toward a way of living that replicates in important ways
*  where we came from. So, you're doing it, you're hunting, you're spending time in nature,
*  we're looking at different ways of raising kids, we're looking at paleo diet, fasting,
*  controlling the frequency of the light that comes into our eyes at night. There are all these-
*  there's this awareness that the way forward requires an understanding of where we came from.
*  So, I kind of feel when I'm having a good day, I feel like we're at this point now,
*  this crisis point where these institutions, central institutions of Western civilization
*  are collapsing around us. They're just government, Wall Street, religion, it's all just like being
*  exposed as incompetent and useless in many cases. But we've learned these really interesting things
*  like birth control and passive energy and different ways of living on the Earth without
*  destroying it. And so, the sort of metaphor I use in the book is that we're going to live in zoos,
*  right? But do we want to live in the Calcutta Zoo or the San Diego Zoo? And I feel like,
*  you know, what we're seeing now is we're clearly in a moment of massive global change.
*  And I hope that what the opportunity will- that's being presented is to redesign human existence in
*  a way that's more in accordance with our nature. Does that make sense?
*  Yeah.
*  That's- I'm struggling to be optimistic.
*  Well, I'm glad. I'm optimistic too. I just- I always wonder if the numbers are just unmanageable.
*  Well, that's why I mentioned birth control, right? Like, we know how to reduce global population.
*  But people want babies.
*  But why do they want babies? What's the incentive?
*  For women, I think there's a biological need. There's a feeling that some- not all women,
*  but many women have, where they have that biological clock. It's telling them to have a baby.
*  When they have a baby- I mean, you've seen women that have children. It's the most intense bonding,
*  the most intense release of oxytocin, the most intense love and feeling of
*  of connection with another living creature that I've ever experienced, that I could ever explain
*  to someone. And it's a natural part of being a human being. It also changes who you are as a person.
*  When you are responsible for these little people and then you have love for these little people.
*  Like, Dave Chappelle said to me once, something that really resonated. He said,
*  not only has it changed how much I love, it changed my capacity for love.
*  And that resonated. I was like, that's what it is. Like, it changes how much you-
*  changed how I feel about other people. And, you know, the experience for a man is entirely
*  different than it is for a woman because the woman literally creates the being in her body, right?
*  A baby is growing inside a woman's body and then she gives birth to it. With a man,
*  you do what you always do, you fuck her, you know? But now you have a baby. And it's undeniable that
*  you love the baby, you love your child, but you did not have the experience of having it grow
*  inside your body, which I think is a connection that no man is ever going to understand.
*  Yeah.
*  You're never going to- I don't think it's possible to understand what a woman experiences when she
*  has a baby grow inside of her body. But then what it changed for me, which was a big one,
*  was it made me look at people instead of looking at them like static beings.
*  Mm. You see the whole thing.
*  Yeah. I looked at them and was like, oh, that was a baby. Christopher Ryan used to be a baby.
*  That was cute too.
*  Yeah. I bet you were adorable. And now here you are, grown ass man.
*  Little redhead.
*  Yeah. I mean, this is something that's missing in our experience
*  when we're not there and we don't see that little person become a big person.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that's missing.
*  I feel like I've gained, you know, this is part of what I was referring to earlier where I said,
*  like, you know, we're learning to dance and the party's almost over. I feel I don't have kids.
*  I've been around kids. But I feel like when I was in my 20s, let's say, I sort of worked this out
*  recently in relationships that I think there are three things. There's attraction, there's
*  compatibility, and there's love. And I look at a lot of my relationships with women, they had two
*  of those. Always love. Sometimes the sex was great and sometimes the compatibility was great and very
*  rarely all three of those. But I used to think love was a really limited, scarce experience in
*  life. And the older I get, the more I feel like, no, love is, I could love anybody. If I spent enough
*  time with them and got to know them, I'd feel love for them. You know, that's not hard to find.
*  It seems it's everywhere. And when I was young, I thought it was really hard to find.
*  Well, for some people it is. You know, some people it is, it's hard to find someone who loves them.
*  And some people are burdened down. Like, you're very free in the sense that because you have this
*  unusual way of making money and you don't have a lot of needs, you don't need a lot of material
*  things. Some people are very burdened by these needs, you know, and they're not free and they're
*  confined to a job and it's very difficult for them to meet anybody, right? And then they're also
*  stressed out all the time because of bills and horse shit and then work politics and work dynamics
*  dealing with the fucking environment of the office. And you got a boss that's an asshole who's like,
*  you know, you have board meetings and shit and everybody's got to sit there and get cancer
*  when this asshole talks. You know, I imagine sitting at a board table and some guys, what we
*  got to do with this company, you know? The matrix. I need you to be here after work. I need you.
*  You're here nine to five. I want to see real commitment. I want to, you know, when I'm,
*  when I'm leaving at seven, yeah, when I'm leaving at seven, I want to see you still here working.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what?
*  Yeah.
*  No! And then it's hard to meet somebody. It's hard to find love.
*  Yeah. Okay. Certainly you're right about that. I didn't really mean in a dating sense so much as
*  just like a compassion sense. You know what I mean? That everybody's lovable.
*  Sure.
*  You know, like one of the things that I love doing in my podcast is meeting somebody who's
*  never told their story before and never even thought of their life in terms of a narrative.
*  And in the course of the podcast, having them realize how fucking interesting they are
*  and how interesting their life is. I've had people like break into tears and stuff,
*  you know, because they've never thought, like no one's ever asked.
*  Right.
*  You know? Everybody's interesting. Everybody's got some kind of bizarre story to tell.
*  Often they don't know it, you know? And I feel the same way, like everybody's lovable.
*  I'm not talking about romantic love.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  I'm just like, yeah. And you reminded me of when you were talking about seeing the full
*  person's life. Sometimes I've looked at like women that I was with who were 35 years old and
*  I like see the old lady in them and be moved by that. You know? Like you're going to be a
*  beautiful old lady. I'll be dead. I'll be gone.
*  You're a weirdo. I see that and I'm like, I gotta get out of here before she becomes an old lady.
*  Oh, I see metaphors coming. Get me out of here.
*  I don't want anybody angry at me for shit I didn't even do.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying. And I mean, everybody's lovable to
*  somebody, right? I mean, unless you're a fucking psychopath.
*  I had another thing I put on my list here I wanted to mention, almost as a public service,
*  sleep apnea. I have sleep apnea. And do you know about this? Do you snore?
*  I have a mouthpiece.
*  You have the CPAP machine?
*  No, no.
*  Oh, you do the jaw thing.
*  No, no, no. It's different. It holds my tongue down. It keeps my tongue from sliding back.
*  It made a world difference. Changed everything.
*  Dude, that's why I wanted to mention it. Like anybody who's got like,
*  I was not breathing for 20 seconds at a time. And yeah, this woman, I was sleeping with
*  actually counted, you know? And she's like, dude, you're choking, you're suffocating.
*  Yeah.
*  So I went and got a test. It's super easy. You take it home and hook this thing in your finger
*  and all that. And they told me, I think it was like 25 episodes per hour is considered severe.
*  I had 74. Every minute I was suffocating to the point where I sort of woke up and like my
*  throat tissue, you know, the muscles contract so you can breathe again. So you're like always at
*  the surface. I got one of those machines, dude. I'm like sleeping again. I'm dreaming. It's fantastic.
*  Now, do you have a hard time putting that thing in your mouth?
*  No, it's no problem. It's like scuba diving. You got a regulator, you know? I mean, the one I,
*  you have the full face one that goes over your nose and your mouth if you tend to
*  breathe through your mouth or they have them that just go over your nose.
*  Which one do you have?
*  I have both. I started, because I used the nose one and then I was breathing through my mouth
*  and that's all weird. So then I got the big one. But after a month with that, now I just use the
*  nose one.
*  Now that pumps air, right?
*  What it does is it creates air pressure, but just very, it's adjustable. It adjusts based on your
*  reaction to it. And so when you are, when you're breathing, the air pressure keeps the passages
*  open. So it can be anatomical. It can be your tongue falling back.
*  That's what it is for me.
*  Yeah. So it keeps the passage open. It's just a slight pressure and it's really nice because
*  you take a, it's like you take a deep breath and it fills your lungs because there's just that
*  little extra push and it's totally quiet. Like there's all this stigma around it. Like people
*  think it's really like gross or loud or whatever. It's not, the new machines are great and they have
*  a humidifier in them so you can adjust the-
*  Do you, how do you power it up when you're camping and stuff?
*  Well, I've got an electrical system in the van and I also have a backup battery,
*  a little lithium battery.
*  That's all you need to power the whole night like that?
*  Yeah, if you don't use the humidifier. If you use the humidifier, it sucks up more
*  because it's a heating thing.
*  Right. Does the humidifier help?
*  Yeah, it's great because you can adjust it. Like here in LA, we're in a desert, it's dry
*  so you can turn it up. If you're, I was in Seattle, I'd turn it off, doesn't matter.
*  So it's just changed the way you feel?
*  I feel so much better. I'm like sleeping through the night. I dream again. Yeah.
*  I mean, I feel kind of evangelical about it because I know a lot of people have this,
*  men and women, and there's this weird kind of shame around it and I'm just trying to be like,
*  Yeah, it's a weird thing to be shameful of.
*  Yeah, fuck it, man. Sleep, you gotta sleep. It's really important. It makes everything better.
*  You're like 50% more likely to have car accidents if you have sleep.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah, it'll fuck up your job, you won't get hard-ons, it'll ruin everything.
*  Some people, it's really bad too and it goes on for years and years and years and they don't
*  even know about it. I was on a plane once and there was a guy behind me and I would hear,
*  and I turned around and I was like, oh, this poor bastard. He was a big guy, like very overweight.
*  And I mean, I was watching this guy lying there with his mouth open like this,
*  suffocating.
*  For a long time. And then finally he would jostle and catch some air and he woke up and I said,
*  hey man, and I said, do you know you have sleep apnea? He's like, what do you mean?
*  And I said, okay, let me tell you what's going on. And I showed him my mouthpiece. I'm like,
*  I have this thing that I have to sleep with because it was a long flight we're on.
*  And I said, you gotta go to a doctor, get that checked out. And he goes, oh, okay, thanks. I go,
*  no, no, no, really? You gotta go to a doctor. I go, this is gonna, it'll change your life.
*  Heart disease, like a lot of bad shit can happen.
*  It also affects people's dietary choices because when you're exhausted like that,
*  I know how I am. Like last night, I was tired. I came home from the improv. It was like one
*  o'clock in the morning. I should not have eaten, but I was like, fuck it. And I made a peanut
*  butter and jelly sandwich at 1 a.m. I definitely shouldn't have had that.
*  Where's the alchemy and jalapenos, man?
*  Well, I just felt like peanut butter and jelly.
*  Yeah, gotta do it.
*  It's a bad choice. But when you're tired, you make bad choices.
*  Right.
*  Make bad dietary choices. It's very, very common when people are exhausted and overworked. And I
*  think that has to apply to people with sleep apnea, where you're always exhausted. Like throughout
*  the day, you're just sucking down coffee and trying to stay awake.
*  Yeah. Yeah, you're drowsy. My dad had it for sure. And he never had it treated. And yeah,
*  maybe that's another reason that I'm sort of evangelical about it, because it's so easy.
*  So many of the things that mess up our lives are really hard to address, like the litany of things
*  you were talking about, board meetings and all that. But if you can get a good night's sleep
*  for a visit to a doctor, and I mean, this thing cost 800 bucks for this machine I have.
*  Yeah, it changes your whole life.
*  Your whole life solves the problem.
*  Yeah.
*  You know? Like, that's pretty cool.
*  It's pretty fucking cool. Some people have a problem with those CPAP machines, but maybe it's
*  just the kind they use. Joey Diaz changed his life. He started using that thing. He brings it,
*  oh, he's got a portable unit. He brings them on planes.
*  Yeah.
*  Brings it everywhere.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's great. I mean, I wish every problem were that easy to solve.
*  Yeah, right? No kidding. What else you got there?
*  On my list?
*  You had a bunch of notes.
*  Oh, Vanthapral. Oh, the Motherfucker Awards.
*  What's that?
*  Do you know about that? So my buddy Kyle and I did it last year. So the idea is,
*  we were hiking one day in Topanga and we were talking about how he's an environmental activist
*  as well as a big wave surfer. Kyle Tierman Show, he's a podcast as well.
*  Everybody has a podcast.
*  Everybody's got a podcast. He's a really good guy. He's like one of these, I think he's 28,
*  he's like super earnest. And he's the kind of guy like you're having a conversation and you mention
*  a book and a week later he's like, hey, I read that book you mentioned. It's really good. It's like,
*  all right. All young people should be like you. He's really smart. Yeah, and serious about stuff.
*  Anyway, we're talking about how hard it is to get people to pay attention to environmental issues
*  because it's such a downer. And I was like, man, I know all these comedians. It would be cool if we
*  could find a way to get comedy into the environmental thing. And we came up with this idea where we flip
*  everything upside down and we say we have an award ceremony to honor the companies that are
*  doing the most to fuck Mother Earth. And the awards are accepted on behalf of the companies
*  by comedians. So we did it last year and it was fucking wild. It was so great. So the presenters
*  were people like Matt Taibbi from Rolling Stone and the guy who was the founder of Greenpeace and
*  environmental people and sort of political people and accepting on behalf of these people like Leo
*  Flowers, if you know him, Jake Johansson, Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero did this incredible
*  bit where they were incestuous brother-sister couple. Yeah, I think they represented Chase Bank.
*  Yeah, and Brendan Wall. She's fantastic.
*  He looks like Dennis Miller there.
*  Hey, he does. Yeah. So it was great. We wore tuxedos and we did this whole thing.
*  Where did you do it at?
*  At a theater in Inglewood.
*  The Miracle Theater in Inglewood.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, it was great. And it's funded by various people but the Nell Newman Foundation,
*  Paul Newman's daughter.
*  Oh, cool.
*  She's a big supporter.
*  When are you doing it again?
*  December 3rd.
*  Ah, cool.
*  Yeah, it's great.
*  Same place?
*  Same place. If you're free, come accept an award.
*  Yeah, let me find out. I think I'm out of town.
*  Yeah, that's the thing. We're lining up like Brian Callan.
*  Oh, beautiful.
*  Yeah, he wants to do it but it depends. Lots of people.
*  We're working together tonight.
*  Oh, good.
*  We worked together last night.
*  I had dinner with him a week ago.
*  Yeah, we did two shows last night and we're doing two shows tonight.
*  I like that guy a lot.
*  I love him to death. He's one of my favorite people.
*  Yeah, and he's also real down to earth. He's a real dude.
*  Super.
*  People often ask me, I guess I'm like a conduit to people like you and Brian.
*  What are they like in real life? They're like they seem to be.
*  I don't think you could do as many podcasts as he does
*  or as many as I do and be somebody else.
*  Right.
*  I don't think.
*  It's too much work holding up the facade.
*  I don't think it would work.
*  I don't think you could hold up a facade that long.
*  I don't. I mean, again, everybody varies.
*  You vary who you are, depending upon the day and the stresses and the influences in life, but
*  I don't know anybody who's full of shit. I don't know anybody who's doing a podcast
*  who's got a totally different persona.
*  Right.
*  I bet a lot of those self-help fellows probably, they're rocking that.
*  That's a full of shit industry.
*  It's one of those. There's people that are real self-help people that are doing real work and
*  they really are committed to it and they love it and they really love helping people.
*  And then there's other people that find that as like a niche. It's a way to get in.
*  It's a little greased path that helps you slip on in.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes it's hard to tell who's who in that world.
*  Yeah. That's a weird world. It's one of the weirdest worlds, the world of constant motivation,
*  where you're constantly motivating people and trying to find some new way to say things you've
*  already said a thousand times.
*  And what's it all boiled down to? It all boils down to the same simple shit again and again.
*  Experience over possessions, forgive yourself and others, love yourself and others.
*  But sometimes they can say something that resonates. Some people can say something
*  that resonates, but those people have to, there's to be something unique about them,
*  like their life experiences. They have to have accomplished something.
*  There has to be some actual meat behind their words. And there's a lot of people that are doing
*  it that are just doing it. They're not really doing anything else. They just do that. That's
*  very strange. It's very strange because they've tapped into this need and this feeling that people
*  have where they need to be motivated and they need someone to say positive spiritual things
*  that resonate with them. So these people have sort of found that as a way to become
*  popular or famous or Insta-famous or whatever.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it's like buying a membership to a gym and then never going.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Or what I do sometimes, like I love to buy camping gear.
*  Pete Liesveld Do you?
*  Pete Slauson I don't really camp very much though.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, like?
*  Pete Slauson But I love camping gear, man. Like high quality tents and backpacks and boots.
*  Pete Liesveld I go to REI, I have grand plans.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld I need stakes. I need those little fucking aluminum stakes to get the
*  tents into the dirt.
*  Pete Liesveld Oh dude, yeah, the spiral ones.
*  Pete Liesveld Oh yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld They're really good in sand as well. I got them. I got a special hammer
*  to put them in and then it's got holes that you like hook and pull them out.
*  Pete Liesveld Oh yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, I've used it maybe twice in five years.
*  Pete Liesveld If you're lucky. Yeah, I bought one of them,
*  fucking, what are those things called? Those little stoves, the little propane stoves,
*  the little thing that sits on top. I never used it.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld I was like, I'm gonna use this on our next trip.
*  Pete Liesveld But when, you know, when civilization collapses,
*  you got that in the garage. That's really important.
*  Pete Liesveld When civilization collapses, you really want flint and steel and you want
*  some tinder. I mean, you can't count on any of that shit because you don't know how to make a
*  lighter. So, you can't count on lighters. You gotta be able to make a fire without a lighter.
*  Also, when civilization ends, you're not gonna want to live.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.
*  Pete Liesveld It's just too hard.
*  Pete Liesveld There's no way to really prepare for it.
*  Pete Liesveld No, it's too hard.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld You know, to live, I mean, I guess if that's all you've ever known,
*  if all you've ever known was living in an incredibly primitive way and hunting and
*  gathering, you'd be fine with it.
*  Pete Liesveld Well, hunting and gathering is easy for hunter-gatherers.
*  Pete Liesveld If you live in a fertile place.
*  Pete Liesveld Even if you don't, in the Kalahari Desert, the
*  Kung San people work roughly 20 hours a week. And what we're calling work is hunting and gathering.
*  Pete Liesveld What are they hunting?
*  Pete Liesveld I guess there are some sorts of antelope, rabbits, rats, desert rats, I don't
*  know. I haven't spent much time in the Kalahari Desert.
*  Pete Liesveld Speaking of rats, there's a fucking crazy article about
*  these monkeys that are eating rats. Macauk, Macauk, how do you say it? Macauk monkeys.
*  Pete Liesveld Macauk.
*  Pete Liesveld Macauk. Killer rat-eating monkey stun scientist in Malaysia.
*  Pete Liesveld I saw that yesterday and I was going to tweet it but I was like,
*  all right, I've tweeted too many fucking crazy things today. Whenever I read something really
*  bonkers, I tweet it. But that one, I'm like, I'm saving this one for tomorrow. But look at the size
*  of that goddamn rat and these monkeys are ferocious predators and they thought of these monkeys as
*  being primarily fruit eaters. But no, they really favor eating rats and it's holding this goddamn
*  rat down and eating it head first. Pete Liesveld
*  What the hell of an image. Pete Liesveld
*  Fucking A, right? Pete Liesveld
*  Yeah. Well, you ever been to – Pete Liesveld
*  Yeah, like a sandwich. It's like he's eating a hoagie.
*  Pete Liesveld Footlong rat.
*  Fucking A, man. Look at his, like the distant look in his eyes.
*  Pete Liesveld Exactly.
*  Pete Liesveld Just eating a rat head.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah. You ever been in a place with wild monkeys?
*  Pete Liesveld Yes. Yeah, Costa Rica. It was weird. We were worried about –
*  Pete Liesveld Do they come right up to the –
*  Pete Liesveld Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld Okay.
*  Pete Liesveld We were staying at this resort and we, one of my kids wanted to feed the monkey an
*  Oreo and my wife was like, oh, we probably shouldn't. It's not good for him. And then I said,
*  let's give him one fucking Oreo. Who cares? I bet he's already had an Oreo before. I forget what
*  the conversation was. Anyway, the monkey takes the Oreo, opens it and eats the white frosting.
*  I was like, that little motherfucker is eating a lot of Oreos. He knew exactly what to do.
*  Pete Liesveld Yeah.
*  Pete Liesveld He turned it, just like everybody does,
*  and starts scraping off the frosting and looking right at you. Yeah, it was – there was different
*  kinds of monkeys too. There was howler monkeys and then there was other – there was big monkeys and
*  little monkeys. That's a crazy place. Costa Rica is wild, man. Crocodiles and shit. That was another
*  interesting place I visited. The crocodiles are a trip, man, because we were in a boat and we went
*  on this, like, sort of tour of this river system. And you go on a tour of the river system. I'm
*  watching this fucking 15 foot crocodile slide into the water from the bank. I'm like, fuck!
*  And you see the crocodile slides all over the banks because these rivers are just filled with
*  crocodiles. And so, anytime my kid would come anywhere close to the railing of the boat,
*  I'm like, hey, hey, hey, let's stay over here. Let's stay in the middle.
*  What the fuck away from the monsters?
*  Pete Liesveld I met this dude a long time ago. I don't remember where he was,
*  but we were sitting around a fire talking about, like, bizarre experiences we'd had traveling,
*  whatever. He was from, I think, New Hampshire. And he had a thing, like you and Marshall go running
*  every morning, he had a thing where he and his dog would go down to the lake and take a swim
*  every day at dusk. When he got home from work, he'd take the dog for a swim. It was a black lab,
*  I think. And he went to visit his brother in Florida. And he drove down there and his brother
*  was out. And when he arrived, and it was around dusk, and he's like, ah, let's go for a swim.
*  There's a lake. And he jumps in the water with his dog and they're swimming across the lake.
*  And he hear it, it's quiet, right? And he hears this plop, plop.
*  And he's like, well, what was that? That's a weird sound. And then he realizes,
*  I'm in fucking Florida. I'm not in New Hampshire. There are alligators here. What the fuck am I
*  doing? So he turns around and starts swimming back. And he's swimming along trying not to panic.
*  And the fucking dog goes, dog's gone. Fucking alligator came or croc came up and
*  took his dog. Never saw the dog again. What?
*  It could have been him too. Yeah. One of my favorite alligator stories from Florida is there
*  was a high speed chase. Guy had a stolen car and he gets to a bridge. The cops are chasing him.
*  Guy jumps out of the car, jumps off the bridge, gets eaten immediately by an alligator.
*  Literally landed in front of the alligator. And the alligator just, ah, snap. They don't eat people
*  that often, but they definitely will. Yeah, in Africa they do. Well, the crocodiles. Alligators
*  are less aggressive than crocodiles. And there are crocodiles in Florida, but they're much less
*  frequent. What's the difference? American alligator is a smaller animal. They have a longer,
*  pointier snout and they have more exposed teeth. An alligator has a blunt, more rounded face and
*  they get much larger than American crocodiles. American crocodiles are pretty small. American
*  alligators get pretty fucking big. So in Africa, do they have crocs and alligators? No, Africa is
*  just crocodiles. Just crocs. They have much, much, much more aggressive crocodiles too. They have
*  Nile crocodiles. Right. You see them take those water buffalo and stuff. Yeah, terrifying. Salt
*  water crocodiles. I thought I had seen video of what you said, so I Googled it four different
*  times, at least in the last couple of years, this has happened. One guy lost his arm, two people died.
*  The Florida thing? Getting chased by the cops and ended up getting eaten by an alligator.
*  It's not just one time it's happened. That's fucking Florida, man. Florida is so wacky.
*  That is the place where all the refuges and the outcasts, they all go to Florida, man.
*  Yeah. Yeah, more than once. I'm sure it makes sense. We jump in the water, man. You're risking
*  it. Just because alligators don't eat people as often as crocodiles do in Africa, it doesn't mean
*  that they wouldn't. They don't have a rule book. Like, oh, that's a person, shouldn't eat them.
*  They don't give a fuck if you're a dog or a person or a kid. There was an alligator ate a baby
*  at Disney World. Oh, I remember that. Yeah, like three years ago. Yeah. Yeah, fucking two-year-old
*  baby playing by the water. The alligator just slides up on the bank, snatch, pulls it right under.
*  Oh, man. Fuck! That's a bad day.
*  Fuck those things. When I lived in Florida when I was a kid, we lived in Gainesville,
*  and there was alligators everywhere. And I remember one of them snatched some lady's dog.
*  And I was like, Jesus Christ, I didn't know they kill people's dogs. Because you would see them
*  floating around and they seemed so innocuous because they were almost always still. They very
*  rarely moved. There were signs they didn't want you to feed them marshmallows. People would throw
*  marshmallows and the alligators would eat marshmallows. And they just don't want you to?
*  They don't digest them well. Because they float, the marshmallows float, I guess. Yeah. And they
*  would just chew them up and swallow them. So people would throw marshmallows at the alligators just to
*  see it. That was back when alligators were endangered. This was in the late 70s. And they're
*  not endangered anymore. In fact, you could kill as many of, like you can get a commercial hunting tag
*  for 500 alligators. I watched that on that Swamp People show.
*  I've never seen it.
*  It was a show about alligator killers. They're just killing alligators because there's a commercial
*  market.
*  Do you know the last Indians to be pacified, I hate that phrase, in the United States,
*  the last tribe to finally give up was the Seminole in the Everglades?
*  Yeah.
*  Like after the Apaches and the Sioux and all that? Yeah, because man, they ever,
*  that would be a weird life. Yeah.
*  Fuck.
*  To live in the Everglades?
*  Well, the Everglades are another thing that human beings ruined because of white trash people in
*  Florida. Because releasing pythons, there's literally nothing left alive in the Everglades.
*  All the deer are missing. All the raccoons are missing. All the marsh hares, gone. Everything's
*  missing. Like these scientists and biologists have done these surveys of wildlife and the
*  difference between like 1980 and 2019 is so unbelievably stark. It's so crazy and it's all
*  those fucking dorks that want to keep pets and then they release them.
*  They release them out there in the wild.
*  Yeah.
*  Pythons.
*  But it's not just the Everglades, right? I read recently like 30% of all the birds in North America
*  are gone in the last 40 years.
*  A lot of that's house cats. Have you ever seen the numbers?
*  How many house cats? How many birds house cats kill? Billions. Billions. Just in United States.
*  But they're cute.
*  Adorable. Fucking billions though.
*  Killers.
*  Billions of birds. Like scientists were baffled when they did the actual survey and they found
*  the real numbers. They're like, this can't be real. This can't be right. Billions.
*  You have a cat, right?
*  Yeah, two cats.
*  Oh, you had a whole bit in your stand up. I remember.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I like cats.
*  I love cats.
*  Yeah. They're interesting creatures. I had three of them in Spain. It was fun. They had
*  their own little world.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You know? Three of them did what they wanted to do.
*  The only bummer is litter boxes.
*  Yeah, I had them outside. Gotta have them outside the house.
*  In my neighborhood, you cannot.
*  Yeah.
*  Coyotes.
*  Yeah, no coyotes in Barcelona.
*  Owls and coyotes.
*  Yeah.
*  Those owls are a motherfucker. They'll snatch them up just as quick as anything.
*  Yeah.
*  We have big owls out here.
*  So if you were gonna die from an animal attack, what animal would you like to die from?
*  You'd like a big cat because they would kill you before they'd eat you.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  A bear would just eat you.
*  Yeah. Black bear will eat you. Grizzly bears sometimes-
*  Grizzly bears will eat you too.
*  Well, they'll fuck you up. Anyway, this is what I was told when I was in Alaska,
*  that you play dead with a grizzly but never with a black.
*  Well, hmm.
*  Because some grizzlies, if they think you're dead, they'll kick some dust on you and come
*  back a week later when you're fermented. They're like French people. They want it to stink.
*  I'm like, oh, jeez.
*  That's not totally true. It depends on how hungry they are and whether or not they're old,
*  but you are more likely to be attacked by a black bear for predation.
*  Right.
*  A friend of mine was attacked recently.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. He had a shoe to black bear. Yeah. He tried to chase it off
*  and he stumbled upon, there was a smell. He's a rancher. He stumbled upon this smell and the
*  smell was a dead cow and this black bear had been eating this dead cow and he tried to chase the
*  black bear off and the black bear decided to try to go after him and had to wind up shooting it.
*  He had a rifle or a pistol?
*  I think it was a pistol, but it wouldn't stop. It wouldn't leave him alone. He's trying to say,
*  hey, get the fuck out of here. Go, go. Throwing it, waving his arms and it wolfed at him and then
*  it turned around and came at him from another direction and then it literally ran up within
*  like 20 feet of him. He's like, okay, we're done here.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  That happened to me with a monkey once.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Did you shoot the monkey?
*  I didn't, no.
*  Did you feed him a rat?
*  This was in Malaysia. I was in a botanical gardens in Penang, Malaysia. I actually told
*  the story at the beginning of Sex at Dawn and I was with my girlfriend at the time and
*  like your situation in Costa Rica, she wanted to give some peanuts to these monkeys.
*  These guys at the entrance were selling little bags of peanuts.
*  There was this baby monkey hanging by his tail over the trail where we were and she pulled out
*  this bag of peanuts and opened it and that attracted all this attention from other monkeys.
*  And while she was handing a peanut to the baby, this other monkey jumped out from the bushes,
*  leapt on her, took the bag of peanuts and was gone like in a flash. It happened so fast.
*  She's screaming. I'm like, what the fuck? It was just like, holy shit, we're surrounded by these
*  monkeys. They're everywhere. And that's when we realized like all the local people had these big
*  sticks and we thought they were walking sticks or something. They'd like to keep the monkeys away.
*  I didn't have a stick. So I got like, I was triggered. Yeah. I got like, fuck you, monkeys.
*  You leave my girl alone.
*  He said that like Joe Dirt.
*  I was not into it. And yeah, I felt like all this testosterone and adrenaline and I was like,
*  Hulk smash.
*  Yeah. So we, you know, 20 minutes later, we're in this sort of field and there's a tree in the
*  middle of the field and there are more baby monkeys and by now she's totally forgotten about it. She's
*  just like, oh, they're cute. So I have the peanuts now and she wants to give more peanuts. So I pull
*  out a bag to give to her and this monkey comes out of the woods, sort of a big one, and he's like
*  looking at me and I'm just like, fuck you, dude. Like I'm three times your size, fuck you. And he
*  sort of like moves, you know, sort of does this thing and he's looking at me and there's a branch.
*  I picked up the branch and threw it at him, right? Kind of like what your buddy was trying to do with
*  his bear. Like, hey, get the fuck out of here, you know. And this monkey just looked at the
*  branch land in front of him and looked up at me and he was like, you fucked up. And he leapt over
*  it and came charging at me with like these fangs, just coming straight at me.
*  I went nuts. I turned into a monkey. I just started going,
*  no. And I was like jumping up and down and spraying spit everywhere and he stopped and we're like,
*  ah! And he's, and my girlfriend's screaming and we're like 10 feet away and then he just like
*  backed up and like, yeah, fuck you. And left. Primal moment. Very primal moment.
*  And you didn't plan that.
*  No. No. If I had had a stick, it wouldn't have been necessary.
*  Oof. So the moral of the story is carry a stick when you're a monkey.
*  Walk softly. Carry a big stick.
*  Dude, I gotta wrap this up.
*  Yeah. Let's go take a nap.
*  I got shit to do. Civilized to death, The Price of Progress, Christopher Ryan,
*  Tangentially Speaking and what's the other one?
*  Been talking about it forever. The first book, Sex at Dawn?
*  No, no, no. What do you call your podcast from the van? It's still just Tangentially Speaking?
*  It's still Tangentially Speaking. It's just hashtag Vanthropology on social media.
*  Always good to see you, brother.
*  Thank you, brother. Thank you.
*  Thanks for being here. Bye, everybody.
