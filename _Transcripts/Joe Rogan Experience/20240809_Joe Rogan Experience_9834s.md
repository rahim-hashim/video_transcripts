# Joe Rogan Experience #2186 - Ari Matti
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU2oPssIuAM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Okay, we're up now.
*  So what were you guys talking shop about?
*  Explain.
*  What was the question you asked Jamie?
*  Well yeah, Jamie's gonna fucking run a train on me.
*  I felt that there was some controversy.
*  There was some tension.
*  There was a little tension in the room.
*  When we had the lovely dinner after your show, we went at it a little bit.
*  And we had a little disagreement about compression technologies, preamps, cloud lifters, you know.
*  What is your position?
*  Well my position is...
*  Well, okay.
*  Hold on.
*  It's coming from a different place though also.
*  Yeah, very different.
*  Let's just say financially we're coming from a very different place.
*  But I try to use the Shure SM7B.
*  We actually got for my podcast, two scissors, shout out.
*  Here we are.
*  It's Estonian.
*  You're not gonna...
*  Well, AI maybe.
*  What did you just shout out?
*  It means direct translation is pussy munchers.
*  It's my podcast.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  So is it in Estonian?
*  Wow.
*  Do you think Spotify will translate it to English?
*  Maybe you'll be the first that goes the opposite way.
*  Bro, if AI translates this podcast, I'm fucked, you know.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Like...
*  Take it down.
*  See, this is the thing.
*  Spotify is going to do that with...
*  But they don't get my charisma and timing down though.
*  No.
*  Also, sense of humor, sarcasm.
*  And when you translate...
*  I'm just gonna say...
*  You sound like a Nazi.
*  I will be a Nazi.
*  It's gonna be...
*  That's the problem with satire and humor and what is, for lack of a better term, it's
*  called talking shit.
*  And this is what we do on podcasts.
*  This is what we do in the green room.
*  This is what me and my friends love to do all the time, right?
*  We do that all the time.
*  We say things we don't mean because it's funny.
*  We say things that are inappropriate because it's funny.
*  And it is 100% done with fun.
*  And the problem is today, people like to take things and pretend you're saying something,
*  but that's not what you're saying.
*  Yeah, there's a funny comedian in Canada.
*  He's an American who moved to Vancouver.
*  He's Dino Archie.
*  He used to say, off the record talk.
*  Right.
*  It's shit talk.
*  We're not saying things that we mean.
*  We're saying things that are fun to say.
*  But what I was gonna get to before we did is the thing that Jamie told me about...
*  Well, Tulsi Gabbard was the first person to tell me about it.
*  So I was talking about how great Tulsi Gabbard is.
*  If you really wanted a great Democratic candidate that was a woman, woman of color, congresswoman
*  for eight years, served overseas in a medical unit twice, that's where she got that gray streak in her hair.
*  She's like an exemplary human being.
*  She likes my Kill Tony bits on Instagram.
*  And they tried to say that I was talking about Kamala Harris.
*  So they edited out of context.
*  Dude, I've seen your edited videos with ads because...
*  Yeah, there's a lot of AI ads that aren't really me.
*  Because Estonia is in Eastern Europe and the Russian bot system in that country.
*  It's crazy, right?
*  Bro, it's crazy.
*  I've seen fake podcasts where there's a guy on your podcast which never has happened.
*  And the guy has a Shure SM7B.
*  Not this mic stand, let's be honest.
*  It's some shittier version.
*  And the backdrop is similar.
*  But you can tell it's not that podcast.
*  Right.
*  But you can do amazing things now with AI.
*  You could do it with video editing for sure.
*  Or you could just have a guy splice in him being in this chair, me being in that chair.
*  And if you did it right and you spent your time on it, you could make it very convincing.
*  And that's just the beginning, man.
*  There's a podcast with me and Steve Jobs.
*  I never met Steve Jobs.
*  I think it's 40 minutes long.
*  How long is the podcast with me and Steve Jobs?
*  But it's a completely AI-generated podcast.
*  It's just audio.
*  But from what I've heard, you can kind of tell, but it's getting close.
*  It's getting to the point where you're not going to be able to tell.
*  You know, when you hear enough computer-generated sentences, you're going to catch little glitches in the Matrix.
*  You know, it's going to sound a little off.
*  But you can only catch those glitches in the Matrix because you're a person who's also around technology, internet.
*  So you kind of see the scam going on.
*  It's not a super visible scam.
*  It's like, oh, I see it's scam.
*  So how long is it?
*  20 minutes.
*  Okay.
*  So it's just me.
*  Let me hear some of it.
*  They seem to have a soul in a way.
*  And some people almost get religious about this stuff because it's so powerful and it means so much.
*  Is that good?
*  If a company gets to the point where it's successfully doing a few things, you don't have to try and do everything.
*  We're in the process now of trying to cut the things we're doing so that we can concentrate on the few that are really high on our priority list.
*  Because if you try to do too many things, none of them get done well.
*  Well, that transition.
*  You've got to focus on a few and make sure those are done well.
*  The transition is clunky, but even more importantly, the sound is very different between where the environment that I'm talking in, the environment he's talking in.
*  So either he's not in the room, which I don't do.
*  I don't do Zoom calls.
*  Those suck.
*  Or, you know, that's fake.
*  It's only two options.
*  An audio engineer just tweaked it for two minutes.
*  They could make it sound so much better.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  You could 100% make it sound like...
*  Yeah, you could 100% make it sound like we're in the same room.
*  But they didn't.
*  But this is also like how many months old?
*  I think that's like...
*  That was two years ago.
*  Oh, crazy.
*  So what they have now is way better.
*  It's way better.
*  It's getting to the point where we're not going to know.
*  For sure.
*  We're not going to know what things are, what things are real.
*  What you can generate...
*  I'm sure you've seen these, the new Unreal Engine, the most complicated video game engine.
*  What is it called?
*  Engine 5?
*  Is that what it's called?
*  It's like, this is spooky.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  It's so good.
*  It's spooky.
*  It looks like a damn movie, like a real movie.
*  Like in Estonia, the movie industry is moving really well.
*  And the government was financing for a while the building of like a movie fucking, I don't know, factory or like a whole, you know, like a production studio.
*  Yes.
*  Which could bring more revenue to the country.
*  Great idea.
*  Right.
*  But some, it's been paused now and people are like, why isn't it making?
*  But I know exactly why it's paused.
*  Why?
*  Because they're waiting to see how this AI thing plays out.
*  Yeah.
*  Because let's be honest, green screens and shit.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  That might be like fax machines, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  It might be like Morse code.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And it happens like this.
*  Well, you saw that Tyler Perry shut down the plans to build this enormous studio.
*  He's going to build an $800 million production studio.
*  And he saw Sora.
*  Tyler Perry.
*  He's the guy who does all those Maeda movies.
*  He's got a bunch of TV series.
*  I thought he's the extreme makeover guy.
*  Move that bus.
*  Remember that guy?
*  Dude, that was my shit.
*  No, he plays a lady in a bunch of famous movies.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Maeda.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So anyway, point Maeda.
*  Madea.
*  Madea.
*  That's right.
*  Sorry.
*  Point is, obviously super successful dude and has this enormous, this is the Unreal 5 engine.
*  He has this enormous production company that he's about to build and he goes, he sees Sora
*  and he's like, what?
*  You guys can do this now?
*  You got to see how that plays out.
*  Dude, it's going to play out real strange.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Because what you see already.
*  So this is the video game.
*  This is hard.
*  This looks pretty good.
*  This is not as convincing as some of the other footage that I saw, the nighttime footage.
*  There's something about daytime footage that looks a little clunky or a little better.
*  That's more reflections.
*  Yeah.
*  I went to Red Band's place.
*  This is pretty wild though.
*  And tried the AI for the first time in my life.
*  Oh nuts.
*  He was saying like he has a second life and they are happy with his girlfriend there and
*  they're like living in a whole other world there.
*  Well, Red Band's slightly insane.
*  I know, but the way he was describing to me, I imagine it's like the Neo where I put the
*  thing in the back and I'm happy now.
*  But it was literally PlayStation 2 graphics.
*  Whenever I want to nerd out about electronics, it's always Red Band.
*  We always talk about the newest phones or the newest this or this does that, that does this.
*  He's just a techno nerd.
*  He loves that shit.
*  And he's already giving up on this life because he knows VR is here.
*  That's such a Red Band move.
*  Every time I tell him to eat something healthy.
*  But you know what?
*  AI is taking over.
*  I'm just going to get my brain teleported.
*  Exactly.
*  That's the ultimate leap, right?
*  Imagine if they get to a point where they say we can download your brain into a computer,
*  but you will cease to exist right here right now.
*  And you just have to assume that it's whatever consciousness is in your head is your life.
*  And it's not just a faction of that consciousness being in a very particular state in time,
*  that consciousness being attached to this particular biological body in this particular place.
*  Like what makes you you?
*  And if you take that shit out and stick it in a machine, what kind of horrific existence is that?
*  What's screaming into the abyss unattached from a body, but trapped trapped in a newly created computer dimension?
*  Because you didn't you didn't get to go to heaven because you got trapped in a metal box.
*  And maybe that's how the aliens contain souls.
*  Maybe that's how they get them.
*  Matrix was basically that whole.
*  That's the thing.
*  Make get you to think that you can download your soul into a computer like, well, I'm going to live forever.
*  Going to download my soul into a computer.
*  And what all you're doing is you're so smart that you're stupid enough to think that technology is capable of recreating you as a whole,
*  not just your consciousness, but what what if your fingernails have memories, motherfucker?
*  What if your whole what if it all is a part of a system and disconnected from that system?
*  Your soul is just like, ah, just separated from love forever.
*  That was what I really liked in the Matrix franchise.
*  Remember when they got out of the Matrix, they went to Zion.
*  There was that scene where they were fucking and then there was that scene where they were dancing and the whole thing was the fucking more.
*  Morpheus was explaining that, yeah, you're not feeling the things with your physical body in this Matrix world, you know, you're going through.
*  It's just the synapses are firing in the machine.
*  And I remember because I was like a teenager when I saw that movie.
*  I remember that scene when they were fucking and I was like, oh, shit.
*  See, that's the thing. If you download your brain into a system and then they came back.
*  The world was shitty. Remember how shitty Zion looked like?
*  Terrible. Terrible. No beaches like us in 50 years.
*  And then they were eating. Remember that food? Everything the body needs.
*  Yeah. But I remember when they did that dancing scene, I remember that like like inspiring a thought where I'm like, huh, maybe even if there is a secondary fucking A.I.
*  world that comes. Yeah.
*  They'll be rebellion. See, that's what I'm saying. No, no question whatsoever.
*  That's why I love when people go is A.I. going to destroy stand up comedy.
*  I always love to say that stand up.
*  Luckily, is the art form that can comment on its own demise, kind of, you know, like even if I creates the perfect act, the perfect laughs per minute.
*  There's going to be you're going to be able to comment on how fucked that is.
*  Right. Yeah. So 100 percent.
*  And then on top of that, the what really what we're really doing is we're performing for live audiences.
*  So how is A.I. going to do that? Yeah, absolutely.
*  There's a thing that happens when you see a singer on stage and someone's got an incredible voice and you see him sing and that the voices echoes or someone like Gary Clark Jr.
*  is playing guitar where you're in the room while they're hitting those keys.
*  You're like, God damn.
*  And then there's the store. It's not even only the technique and the incredible voice.
*  It's also the experience, the history of his experience.
*  Yeah, I remember when I was like when I was like 19, I worked at a jazz bar.
*  Didn't know shit about you. I don't know shit about music.
*  I don't know how to play. Do you know how to play anything?
*  I don't play. Literally, I don't know how to draw or play.
*  And like my hands just don't work like that. I tried guitar.
*  It just doesn't happen. Dudes are just and they're like, feel that nothing.
*  This connection. Nothing's happening. Interesting.
*  But I remember working at that bar.
*  There was like there's a famous Estonian guy who was performing like an unplugged.
*  He was like a rock star and he was performing an unplugged version on the weekends, you know,
*  and technically he sounded amazing. He was an amazing guitar player,
*  but he was a young guy, maybe only five years older than me.
*  Technically perfect from the traditional training, the school.
*  He had all the things. And for me, that sounds amazing, right?
*  But then I remember we started having because it was turning.
*  We had blues nights on Tuesdays and the owner would fly out from America like New Orleans.
*  These 65 year old black dudes that live a rough life.
*  You can see from their face, from the way they move.
*  It's been a rough life and the way they would sing, maybe technically it wouldn't be
*  sound as clean, but what you would feel because I was bartending
*  and I would look at the audiences and I would see them. Also, you feel it.
*  Right. You can't explain. Dude, I don't know.
*  Of course, later when I got to befriend some musicians that they would explain, they would be like,
*  no, no, no, that guy, the other guy was doing the basic ABC.
*  He's doing a whole different shit right now.
*  So it's something that only the people that really know how to play recognize.
*  Like stand up. Right. But I feel it.
*  I think that's the case with everything, man. I really do.
*  I think that's the case with everything. Everything. Yeah. Especially art.
*  I think everything that it's a true form of expression, you know, even like chess.
*  I think games people play. I think it exists in everything.
*  Because I remember, I even remember when there was a peer to peer before Torrance,
*  it was peer to peer. Sure. What did you guys have? Kazaa, iMesh?
*  What did we have? What was that one?
*  Name them. We had them all. Kazaa, iMesh, LimeWire.
*  What was the one that everybody used?
*  We started off with Napster and then we went into Kazaa, LimeWire and Morpheus.
*  Yeah. I remember the Napster days.
*  Metallica Suit Napster, you know?
*  Oh yeah. Lars Alwerck was very upset. Yeah.
*  And so was I had Paul Stanley from Kiss on the podcast.
*  He was just flat out saying those people are stealing. They're stealing money.
*  You know, my position, it was very, I was like, okay, a bomb just went off
*  and you could either recognize you have a hole in the ship
*  or you can go full steam ahead with the original plan and this motherfucker is going to sink.
*  It's like that cartoon when Tom and Jerry, when he's trying to dissipate, shinking.
*  The moment music becomes a digital piece of information that can be uploaded to a hard drive,
*  the moment that happens, it's over.
*  So if you don't realize that the war has been lost
*  and devise some sort of monetization of streaming platform,
*  make it simpler, quicker, faster than anybody else's,
*  and then get it up there quick because they should have done that the moment Napster came out.
*  They should have hired the best coders.
*  And so, okay, there is no way you're stopping this.
*  The dam broke, water's coming through, and record sales are gone.
*  Record sales just went away so quickly.
*  Guys were making millions and millions of dollars from record sales, and then they'd go on tour.
*  But even live touring was on a down slope because you didn't need to do that that much.
*  Record sales was the back.
*  That's why Madonna went back on tour. I mean, I don't know this, but that's why...
*  She probably also wanted to say what's up.
*  For sure.
*  Let bitches know.
*  For sure.
*  She's still around.
*  But there's a lot of bands that went back on tour for that very reason.
*  Uh-huh. Yeah, for sure, definitely.
*  Yeah, their revenue dried up, which is crazy that one of the biggest entertainment businesses in the world
*  lost all of its sales revenue from recordings.
*  I mean, I don't know, it didn't lose all of it.
*  I'm sure some people still buy some of them.
*  But the drop-off must have been crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  Because remember, it was all like, you guys had not cassettes.
*  What did you guys have? A-Tracks.
*  We had A-Tracks first, and then we had cassettes, and then we had compact discs.
*  Yeah, we only got cassettes, then it was CDs.
*  So the format was always changing, and then it was the Blu-ray and the Microsoft, whatever format they had, battle.
*  So there's always that battle of data.
*  Then for a while, like, USBs were tried, you know, they would sell small USBs.
*  But then just the internet was like, physical, it was over.
*  Isn't that crazy? And not only that, it's way better.
*  Like, imagine if YouTube was just a bunch of discs that you had to get.
*  That's stupid, that would be!
*  But then again-
*  That's a good example of how much things have changed, is the fact that YouTube exists,
*  and that YouTube is not a stack of discs that you have to go to a library or a bookstore to get.
*  Yeah.
*  YouTube just exists instantaneously.
*  But then again, there was that magic of- I feel lucky, at least, to have that childhood,
*  where I remember that my attention was actually not raped by technology that much,
*  but I had to actually look forward to consuming something and work physical exertion to get it.
*  Go to the DVD thing, you would read the back, you would look at the-
*  Yeah.
*  It would put- there's a more, maybe, commitment to consumption.
*  I think it's going to be very interesting when we look back on human beings,
*  and I think we're in the middle of it right now,
*  so we probably don't really objectively understand how much of an impact it's had on us,
*  because it's sort of trickled in slowly with just regular cell phones,
*  and then like, remember those sidekicks?
*  People had the sidekicks that you could send texts on, it would go sideways.
*  Remember?
*  We were like, wow, that's crazy.
*  That was like next level.
*  And then blackberries, if you were fucking serious,
*  if you're really getting some shit done, answering some emails, you had a blackberry.
*  And then when the iPhone came out, the whole game just fucking flipped on its head,
*  and now all of a sudden, everyone's connected to everyone everywhere,
*  and everyone's anxious and freaking out.
*  And I think that we grew up before that, and I'm older than you by far,
*  so I grew up way before.
*  How old are you now?
*  32.
*  Yeah, so I'm almost 57.
*  And you're also like those very important years.
*  That's the big transition years, because it was a series of factors that happened in my lifetime.
*  Number one, answering machines.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  You can call someone and leave a message, and you would come home,
*  and your answering machine light would be like a little dog.
*  Like if the red light was going on, like, oh, someone loves me, someone loves me,
*  and you'd go listen to your messages.
*  And then it got to a point where you could call your own phone
*  and get your answering machine to play you your messages.
*  That was next level shit, okay?
*  Crazy technology.
*  We couldn't believe it.
*  You got to see caller ID, who's calling you, and then you get to call them back, star 69, what's up?
*  You know, and then VHS tapes come along.
*  Maybe not even then.
*  It was kind of along the same soup, because it all happened while I was in high school.
*  So while I was in high school, there was probably answering machines before I was in high school,
*  but I was aware of them in high school, then caller ID, and then VHS tapes.
*  All that happened.
*  So now all of a sudden, you could just get stuff and play it anytime you wanted to.
*  So it changed like watching movies.
*  You could pause it if you had to take a leak.
*  The whole thing changed.
*  People started watching movies at home.
*  Blockbuster became a giant thing.
*  Nobody would have imagined Blockbuster's going to go bye-bye.
*  Nobody. It was the thing.
*  You go to Blockbuster on Friday night.
*  You see what's the fucking latest movies.
*  Oh, great. There's one left.
*  Yeah, we had like a video planet.
*  It was like the top five most making money fucking companies in the country.
*  Imagine. They were on an ice cube.
*  They were on an ice cube and a hot piece of tea.
*  That's what I'm always wondering is what is the industry right now that doesn't even know?
*  I think there's a lot of them.
*  Oh, a lot.
*  I don't think it's uh.
*  I think AI is going to fuck up this system that we have going for us.
*  I think that's why that's part of the reason why there's a lot of scrambling and clamoring for power right now.
*  Because I think people have a real understanding at the highest level that it's only we only have so much more time before this AI thing becomes one of the most enormous aspects of society.
*  And the power consumption that's going to need is astronomical.
*  It's crazy. They're literally building nuclear power plants for these fucking things and they're going full throttle.
*  And we're headed towards whatever this is and no one knows.
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why governments are trying to crack down on social media and trying to control it and stop people from saying things.
*  And in the UK, they're arresting people for saying certain things.
*  They're trying to like stop this thing from overwhelming them.
*  And you can't.
*  It's going to overwhelm all of us.
*  It's not just going to overwhelm government.
*  It's going to overwhelm civilization.
*  And it's going to happen in a bunch of stages just like it happened with us where we got caller ID.
*  We got answering machines.
*  We got VHS tapes.
*  Then we got computers and we got online and then we got 14 for then we got 56 K and then you start seeing pictures show up like they download them nice and slow.
*  And then people got cable.
*  Oh my God.
*  You get cable internet.
*  So people had cable internet.
*  We could just like how many pixels born used to have like how may how glorious.
*  Fuck.
*  I remember I had a point when I was like like mom goes to store and you know how you ask which store so you know how much time you got in the back.
*  And I remember like jacking off and halfway through the video.
*  It's two dudes.
*  I just didn't the pixels.
*  It was just such quality.
*  That's uncomfortable.
*  It was just very well.
*  Didn't you know when they were both sucking each other's dicks to something when there was a guy.
*  Where is the girl.
*  Yeah.
*  When is she coming in.
*  But it was like in a sauna in the dark and I saw the dudes like hog hanging.
*  But he had a nice spot and it all looked.
*  You ever flashed in the sauna by a dude.
*  Flat.
*  We only go naked.
*  You know that right.
*  Oh in your country.
*  Of course.
*  And if you have pants on that's creepy and that's weird.
*  If you come in with pants we would have an issue.
*  Really.
*  Because it's weird.
*  What are you hiding.
*  What's the thing.
*  You have a boner.
*  Exactly.
*  What's going on.
*  Dude just staring at my dick.
*  I'd rather just go my own way.
*  Good luck with that.
*  Like in the green room.
*  In the green room comedians were talking about how many dicks they've seen in their lifetime.
*  And I remember they were like saying like numbers.
*  Bro I've seen thousand.
*  I've seen 16 to 22 thousand dicks.
*  Do you think that's healthy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah it's normal you know.
*  Normal shit.
*  Normal shit.
*  Just look at the dicks.
*  And then sometimes I remember in high school we all showered together.
*  There was always one weird kid that would not shower with us and you make fun of him.
*  Show me what's going on.
*  Why didn't you show us your dick.
*  That's funny.
*  And then sometimes the shower would be a bit warm and you would get a little bit of a vein
*  going there.
*  You know you get a little bit of a 25 percent.
*  And then you're lathering it down.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You just fucking mentally just make it go away.
*  Yeah.
*  Naked dudes and shot and saunas is odd thing.
*  I only feel comfortable when it's naked.
*  There was a I used to be a member of 24 hour fitness in Woodland Hills California and the
*  guy was the manager there is a cool guy.
*  I used to talk to him all the time my friend Eddie and I used to live there and he was
*  the former manager of the West Hollywood one.
*  So he said he goes bro the West Hollywood 24 hour fitness he goes it was basically like
*  a gay hook up spot.
*  That's all it was.
*  Like these guys would just go ham.
*  Just get after each other.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And like you'd have to say hey don't do that.
*  But it's like you've got guys who want to fuck guys hanging out all working out together
*  and getting sweaty.
*  Yeah.
*  With like guy mentality.
*  Yeah.
*  You know like come on let's do it here.
*  Like yeah and they're doing it there.
*  And then there's all guys that are gay there.
*  So they're like what are you going to do.
*  And he was like dude it was crazy.
*  He goes I used to have to stop people from fucking in the sauna.
*  The smell in the showers.
*  I'm sure they don't do that anymore folks.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sure that's all been cleaned up.
*  But back then he was telling me it was.
*  I can imagine the 24 hour fitness still existing and then this podcast coming out and there's
*  just 800 gay dudes wearing fuck.
*  They're like Joe Rogan can you stop saying this is the suck and fuck spot.
*  Make sure there is a make sure it's the right gym.
*  I don't want to.
*  I don't want to slander anyone.
*  But there is a 24 hour fitness right because I know there's another one.
*  There's another gym like that.
*  And I actually work out at a gym that was in a gay neighborhood.
*  I used to have a bit about it.
*  I used to wear out a Gold's gym on coal and it was in full on West Hollywood like super
*  super gay gym.
*  But it was really close to the studio where we film news radio.
*  So I just got a membership there.
*  So I'd get off work and I go lift.
*  I just go live with these like hungry gay dudes.
*  These dudes were hungry man.
*  Yeah.
*  They like look at you and they're friendly.
*  Nobody fucked with me.
*  Nobody like no unwanted attention or anything like that.
*  But I didn't take a lot of showers there.
*  I remember there was an old guy at the gym.
*  It was right in the middle of Santa Monica Boulevard.
*  Yeah.
*  It's closed now.
*  OK.
*  Good.
*  Good.
*  It's closed.
*  OK.
*  So it's closed on coal is the one I'm talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the one that's not West Hollywood.
*  It's like East Hollywood.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever it was, it was gay.
*  But like men, you know, like big hairy muscular gay dudes looking for more of that.
*  So it's like men fucking men.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a wounded gazelle.
*  Yeah.
*  Pack a hyena.
*  Excuse me.
*  Pardon me.
*  Just want to get to the river.
*  I remember there was an older guy in my gym.
*  And that was the first time I also experienced where it's like it's an old guy.
*  You know, I fucking I'm not threatened.
*  Right.
*  I'm not threatened.
*  But the look he had in his eyes just made me feel vulnerable for, you know, because he wanted to penetrate you because men have a certain and I remember then I started thinking when I was like younger.
*  That was the first time I started thinking, oh shit, that's how women feel.
*  Plus the physical.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like that's like Brock Lesnar looking at you like, you know, that's like, you know, I have had gay guys hit on me that I could kill and it made me uncomfortable.
*  That guy.
*  Like it just gets to this like, hey, you know, I'm not gay.
*  So what are you doing?
*  Exactly.
*  You're just trying to make me uncomfortable.
*  Exactly.
*  And you get nervous.
*  And this old guy would give me looks and I would just feel and it was the first time in my life.
*  I'm just like, dude, I'm Jack.
*  I'm doing fucking MMA, but I'm feeling vulnerable.
*  And then one point in the shower, this was like, you know, when showers have the booths, you know, the separation booths and it was me and him.
*  So I go in the sun.
*  It's the gym is empty.
*  I go into sauna.
*  I'm alone and Dix.
*  It's Dic nation, you know, it's Estonia.
*  So I'm in the sauna.
*  I go in the shower door open and in my head, I know, you know, in your head, you're like, there's other people at this gym, but let me bet.
*  Because I saw him looking at me.
*  I go, let me bet.
*  And you know it.
*  He comes in.
*  He sees one towel up, you know, so there's somebody in the sauna.
*  He comes to the sauna.
*  I wait for him to go to the showers first, because I know if I go the next booth over, this guy's joining.
*  So he goes into the corner.
*  I picked the opposite corner.
*  And then at one point I'm sharing and I just it's that human thing.
*  It's that human thing where you feel something is watch or something tension.
*  And I look through the fuck in all the other separation booths.
*  They had a small gap that you can see through all of them.
*  And he's got shampoo and in the other end, I just see his one eye like this.
*  And he's taking his hand.
*  He's not jacking off.
*  He's just holding onto it.
*  But something's going on.
*  He's getting ready.
*  He's warming up.
*  He's showing you that he's got a he's got a dick.
*  But then and he had this look.
*  Serious.
*  Yeah.
*  Angry.
*  And I'm leaving the gym and I'm passing and I know the administrator girls working at the gym.
*  I passed them.
*  And in my head, I'm thinking I just got like sexually assaulted actually.
*  No, that's not so.
*  So don't be a baby.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  See, no, he made you feel creepy.
*  Maybe feel creepy.
*  Yeah.
*  So I feel I can't keep this in.
*  I turn around.
*  I go to the administrator.
*  I go, hey, we're laughing about it.
*  I go, this fucking old guy.
*  And then we wait.
*  And he takes like 40 to 50 minutes to come out of that.
*  See, what I think is he's shameful because oh, yeah.
*  And he comes out.
*  His face is red.
*  He has a hoodie on and he's just ran out of the gym.
*  Never came back.
*  I think it just that's that post nut.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, well, he probably is embarrassed that he did it again.
*  You know, it's probably one of those things.
*  He's probably been kicked out of gyms before.
*  Like he's like got an exit strategy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what he does.
*  He's a shower jerker.
*  Yeah.
*  Those exist.
*  That's why I don't like walking around naked.
*  OK.
*  Like if you were a woman and you have your beautiful vagina and their co-edged showers,
*  would you be really be comfortable washing your butthole and your vagina in front of a bunch of men?
*  No, of course not.
*  We are.
*  Gay guys are real.
*  And if your little booty hole and your little dick is out flopping around in front of them.
*  To me, as a person who doesn't want any of that, I would imagine that I would not enjoy watching someone stare at my Johnson.
*  Who wants to take a piece of sock on?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like, OK, that's we don't need to think about that.
*  But I think we have just culturally.
*  That's why you can't have men in a room with naked girls.
*  We did that.
*  In our culture, we all when I was a little kid, I saw grown pussy all the time.
*  This is why your country so fucked up.
*  You guys, you barely survived Viking Wars.
*  And then what's left over?
*  You know, you're just a bunch of fucking maniacal crazy people showing each other's pussies and dicks to each other.
*  I feel like something should be sacred.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Like I have no problem with being around gay guys, but I don't think I should be showing them my cock.
*  I don't think that's the right move.
*  I also don't think ladies as comfortable as you are naked should be in a room full of men and just show your bare pussy.
*  That seems problematic.
*  It seems like it's going to cause issues for you.
*  Like I wouldn't do that if I was you.
*  You know, if you want to wear a bikini, great.
*  Everything's covered, which is like how funny is that?
*  The bikini thing is hilarious.
*  You know, that there's this little tiny little piece of cloth, little tiny little piece.
*  You know, on Instagram they have that little little Dorito.
*  And you see, all I don't see is the actual episode.
*  By the way, I like it.
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't do it.
*  Please don't stop wearing them.
*  I think they're great.
*  I like G-strings.
*  I like girls with beautiful bodies expressing themselves and wearing whatever they want to wear.
*  I'm just saying it's so different than shorts.
*  Like if a dude wears Speedos, he's a freak.
*  Right?
*  A dude in Speedos, unless you're in your fucking country.
*  But a dude in America in Speedos is a weirdo.
*  Some dude in Speedos, that guy's a weirdo.
*  If you don't have goggles on, if you didn't come from a long ass swim, you fucking weirdo.
*  Why are you wearing Speedos?
*  Everybody wears shorts.
*  But ladies, that's for Christ's sake.
*  That's Estonia.
*  Every step that, every man I've ever seen growing up, I've seen their dick.
*  That's inflammation in its human form.
*  That is true.
*  That is an inflamed body.
*  That's an inflamed body.
*  I wouldn't recommend that.
*  That's what makes the G-string funnier.
*  Right?
*  The Speedos is what makes all of it funnier.
*  But it's funny, the difference between, like, okay, women's formal attire.
*  Right?
*  So not even formal, but like say a woman who's a presenter on television.
*  Right?
*  Skirt, no problem.
*  Bare toes, open toe shoes, no problem at all.
*  Have one of them ones that dangles off your foot a little bit, not all the way on.
*  No one cares.
*  Vagina curtain that covers about 12 inches from your waist down, that's fine.
*  Boobs.
*  All out.
*  Pressed out together and pushed up and forward.
*  I love how that's formal.
*  No sleeves.
*  No sleeves.
*  Bare arms.
*  And to have as much skin as you could possibly get without being naked and to be dressed
*  on television.
*  And that's formal.
*  Lipstick.
*  Yeah.
*  They're always hot.
*  Painted nails, painted toenails, everything smooth and polished and shaved.
*  That's fine.
*  That's the news.
*  This is totally fine.
*  And that's formal, you know.
*  Imagine if men in gym shorts and tank tops were giving the news how fucking stupid it
*  would look.
*  Imagine if all these people that you see on the news, imagine Don Lemon in his boxer shorts
*  with a tank top on giving the news.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's kind of what a dress is.
*  For sure.
*  A dress with a skirt for those Fox News ladies.
*  How is that different than me in these shorts that I'm wearing right now and a tank top?
*  How is it different?
*  It's just less threatening maybe.
*  And it's nice.
*  It's nice.
*  I don't want to discourage it.
*  I just think how crazy is the difference between what men wear versus what women wear.
*  We have a jacket on like it's cold out.
*  We have a fucking vest and a tie and a shirt and all this shit.
*  And women can essentially be almost naked.
*  And you only assume they have underwear on.
*  That might be a thrill if you don't have underwear on the news.
*  Whoa, if she had underwear on maybe you'd be able to see it through the garments on
*  the outside.
*  That would be terrible.
*  That would ruin the look.
*  Ruin the look.
*  That would be, no one's going to look at my pussy.
*  Have you ever had a girl like that?
*  Did you go to a nightclub and they're not wearing underwear?
*  I have not.
*  I would imagine that's a wild lady.
*  It's hot.
*  Yes.
*  I was one time dancing with a girl.
*  And she told you?
*  No.
*  She grabbed my hand.
*  Whoa.
*  And she was walking through the dance floor.
*  You know how chicks just fucking push people out of the way and pull you.
*  And then we get to the dance floor and she pulls my hand and goes, where is this?
*  And it's soaking.
*  Damn.
*  She's a wild one.
*  Wild one.
*  Viking babies.
*  That's what that is.
*  That's what it is.
*  The survivors.
*  And she was strong out there.
*  Survivors.
*  She was strong out there.
*  Of the massacres.
*  And she was living in Australia.
*  She had one of those jeeps that has one of those fucking things up front that kills the
*  kangaroos.
*  Whoa.
*  We saw one of those in San Antonio right in front of the truck.
*  Or in front of the production trucks.
*  You see that fucking crazy thing that guy had?
*  Super tall.
*  Over the top?
*  Oh, because they're big.
*  Because they're big.
*  And it looks mad, Max.
*  It looks like I'm up front.
*  It looks crazy.
*  And she had that jeep.
*  She had horns.
*  And then the balls hanging from the back.
*  The soft balls that they put in the back.
*  They had that.
*  And she was just a fucking wild one.
*  Wow.
*  And then she had a kangaroo shield in the front of her vehicle.
*  And this was like when I visited Australia.
*  And in my head I was like, kangaroos are like cutie patooties.
*  But when you go to Australia, they'll tell them, like, we hate them.
*  Because they just keep jumping in front of cars.
*  Well they're everywhere now, too.
*  They're fucking everywhere.
*  They have a lot of kangaroos.
*  It's a weird animal, man.
*  It's marsupial.
*  Like, it's so strange.
*  They have a pouch.
*  They keep their babies in their skin.
*  How'd they develop a backpack?
*  It is the insane-est evolutionary pouch.
*  How?
*  How?
*  How does that?
*  I mean, how does nature make you get a bag?
*  That's so crazy.
*  It's like one of the, out of all the animals, where the fuck did that come from?
*  If you look at a deer and then you look at an elk, you go, oh, I kind of see.
*  You look at a moose.
*  You look at a caribou.
*  You're like, oh, I can kind of see.
*  And they're like, what's that?
*  And why is it only in this one spot?
*  Why does it jump like...
*  Yo, is that an alien?
*  What is that thing?
*  Why did it develop on Australia and nowhere else?
*  What the fuck is that thing?
*  And how come there's nothing that can kill it?
*  How come you stand on your tail and do like a Steve-O kick?
*  And kick you hard.
*  And do like a Steve-O kick.
*  They can kick you hard.
*  Yeah.
*  They'll fuck you up.
*  They disembowel people, man.
*  You got to be really careful with those fuckers.
*  Oh, and they're...
*  People die from the big ones.
*  Are the big ones the gray ones?
*  Are the gray ones the big ones or the red one?
*  Eddie Ift went over there and he said he was walking through a backyard and there was like
*  a six-foot tall kangaroo.
*  Jesus fucking Christ.
*  He thought it was fake.
*  He thought it was fake.
*  He didn't know what it was.
*  And his friend was screaming at him, get...
*  Turn around.
*  Get the fuck away from it.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  The red kangaroo.
*  That's the big one?
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, more soupy.
*  That sounds like a fucking alien, too.
*  A hundred pounds.
*  So, you got to think, a hundred pound thing that could run 43 miles an hour and it could
*  probably strangle you.
*  Like those ones that are jacked.
*  You ever see the one that...
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They choke out dogs and shit.
*  Of course, dude.
*  Look at the fucking muscles in that thing.
*  Of course, dude.
*  What a freaky animal to have all over the place.
*  But it just looks...
*  Look at that one.
*  I've seen all those pictures, by the way.
*  That's one that went to my gym.
*  That's gold gym.
*  Look at that, dude.
*  This guy is...
*  Yo, he's just chilling.
*  Flaunting giant muscles.
*  Look at the fucking guns on that, dude.
*  What's up, player?
*  What's up?
*  Do you imagine getting in a scratching match with that thing with his giant claws?
*  No, no, you're done.
*  I mean...
*  But then fuck you up, man.
*  They're dangerous.
*  And they're all over the place.
*  But that was my question.
*  What was supposed to be killing them?
*  Because there's no infestations of wild animals like that unless something disrupts the ecosystem.
*  Huh.
*  Because usually there's a balance, right?
*  There's always going to be a balance between wolves and antelope or wolves and bears, wolves
*  and deer, because they're going to figure out who wins.
*  And if the wolves kill off too many of the deer, then their population is going to drop
*  they're going to run out of food, and there's going to be some sort of consequences, and
*  then their population drops down, and then the deer population comes back a little bit.
*  Nature has a way of balancing itself out in most environments until human beings step
*  in and start fucking with things.
*  So my question is, what happened over in Australia that that thing, that one crazy animal, becomes
*  hordes of them, swarms of them?
*  Show some of those videos of the swarms of kangaroos just running.
*  So these people are in their car, and you see just like, I don't even know what the
*  number is.
*  Oh yeah, and they're fast.
*  They're fat, but it's also like, why are there so many of them?
*  In any environment where there's something like this, there'd be something bigger that
*  eats it.
*  In every environment, there'd be a bear, there'd be something.
*  I guess Australia has crocodiles, but I don't think they're doing such a good job of killing
*  these things.
*  Natural predators are just like dog-like animals.
*  Oh, maybe the thylacine.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  Okay, the Tasmanian tiger that went extinct.
*  That's a native of Australia as well, that they have that in Australia.
*  But they should have to shoot so many kangaroos now.
*  Where is that, Jamie?
*  Tasmanian wolf and a dingo, and a wedge-tailed eagle.
*  Okay, so the humans probably killed all those animals.
*  The humans probably killed all the dingoes.
*  And what was the other animal?
*  Wedge-tailed eagle.
*  Makes sense.
*  That's probably exactly what it is.
*  So the thylacine was Australia, though, right?
*  It says Tasmanian.
*  I just typed in marsupial natural predators, and Tasmanian wolf is the first one listed.
*  Thylacine?
*  Tasmanian wolf.
*  Yeah, but the thylacine, the Tasmanian tiger.
*  And then it says Tasmanian tiger before they were extinct, and also humans.
*  Was that ever in Australia?
*  Am I making that up?
*  I feel like that's in Australia.
*  I mean, it definitely wasn't in the movies as far as I know.
*  Right, there's a good movie about a guy who goes to kill it, because they're trying to find it.
*  The last thylacine.
*  What the fuck is it?
*  Willem Dafoe.
*  It's a good movie.
*  So it is in Australia.
*  Native to Australian.
*  Right, okay.
*  So there was that thing.
*  You ever seen one?
*  They're freaky-looking.
*  Show the video of the last known living thylacine.
*  I thought thylacine was in Elphaba.
*  That's a thylacine.
*  Look at the mouth on that fucking thing.
*  Look at the mouth on that fucking thing.
*  Look how big its mouth is.
*  Isn't that insane?
*  It's like a horror movie.
*  Look at this fucking mouth.
*  Have you seen that thing open its face at you?
*  It's a dog with a stripe and shit?
*  Yeah, it looks like a tiger.
*  It's a weird marsupial.
*  Rare photos of the last.
*  I'm pretty sure they're marsupial as well.
*  So they think that thing might be still alive.
*  There might be limited numbers of them.
*  Well, this isn't a Tasmanian.
*  That's not real.
*  Somebody painted it.
*  Oh, this is in color.
*  Oh, they colorized it.
*  They colorized it.
*  Because I think the film is from the 1930s.
*  But this is the last one.
*  And look, they have it in a fucking box, man.
*  Ugh, godzooze creep me out.
*  We just get so comfortable with torturing some animals mentally.
*  I understand, but can you bitches afford a larger piece of land, god damn it?
*  This concrete fucking...
*  That's crazy.
*  You have the last of these things alive and you make it suffer in a small box with no pillow.
*  I'm not a big zoo guy either.
*  Even as a kid, I remember, like, I just didn't...
*  Yeah.
*  I remember, like, even just seeing, I remember seeing, like, a hippo in a zoo.
*  And all he has is a small...
*  It's an Estonian zoo, too.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's a small, like, just a dribble of water on his head.
*  And he would just...
*  Just because they're all drugged out.
*  And they would just do this...
*  Uhhh...
*  Like, just...
*  Just...
*  Because also, you know, the animal doesn't know.
*  Dude, I was in Massachusetts once and I was on my way home from...
*  It was when I was driving limos.
*  And I was coming down this highway and I saw this really rinky-dink zoo.
*  And I was like, I think I was coming from New Hampshire.
*  I don't really remember.
*  But I remember it was a long drive and I had the rest of the day off.
*  So I said, fuck it, I'm gonna go in this zoo and see what the fuck is going on in this zoo.
*  Just for funsies, because I was out there.
*  And I saw this polar bear.
*  I'll never forget this dude.
*  Just pacing.
*  Just pacing.
*  Just pacing.
*  And I was like, oh my God, he's in hell.
*  It's a horrible thing to watch, man.
*  It's a horrible thing to watch.
*  Because, like, that's a sentient being that's experiencing a very bizarre and prolonged suffering.
*  And a disconnection from...
*  It's kind.
*  There's no other bear with it.
*  It's just by itself.
*  By itself in this cement thing.
*  And while people stare at it.
*  Something that would never happen in the real world.
*  He doesn't know what the fuck is happening.
*  Because it's the wrong climate.
*  Everything's wrong.
*  And he's like, why is my shit all so shitty?
*  But he doesn't even know that he's in a totally wrong...
*  He probably is happy in Boston for like five months a year or four months a year.
*  But even then it's probably not cold enough for him.
*  Those fuckers, they're used to living in places where there's nothing but ice.
*  But it's also like that thing of, like, they say that, oh yeah, but if you let him go,
*  he would die.
*  But that's also because you just...
*  Well, you shouldn't have them in the first place.
*  That's the matrix, the real world thing again.
*  That animals also will have that thing where they're...
*  If they're in the wild, I'm sure it's exactly like being in that matrix where in the zoo,
*  yeah, you have all your food, all the stimulus, you're alive.
*  But it's that you gotta get that stimulus you created to struggle, to hunt, to fucking...
*  Right.
*  Which is...
*  I mean, there's a lot of similarities in human beings.
*  Absolutely.
*  There's a lot of people that are zoo animals.
*  It's like when you go to nature.
*  Like in Austin, because I do so much comedy, I'm into cycling now.
*  And sometimes I'll cycle out of the city.
*  But every two weeks I have enough energy to do like a long cycle.
*  And when I get to complete...
*  That's why I love Estonia too.
*  Like it's silence in the woods that you have.
*  And you just feel...
*  Because that's where for thousands of years we've been there.
*  That's where we've been, in that silence.
*  And then you just feel rejuvenated immediately.
*  I love the sea, I love the ocean, I love woods.
*  I've always been a big...
*  And that's the same feeling you get.
*  It's just you feel it in your blood.
*  Something's fucking...
*  It's raw.
*  Yeah, you're alive.
*  It's uncomfortable, but it's raw.
*  Of course I wanna be on Twitter in my farting and ordering Uber Eats.
*  Of course I want to do that.
*  That's the matrix.
*  That's the zoo.
*  That's the matrix.
*  It's the human zoo animal.
*  And of course outside is a fucking mosquito, there's a guy.
*  There's whatever, you know.
*  You hear some fucking animal you don't know.
*  I'm scared of fucking spiders, everything.
*  When the bomb goes off, you hear the first recoil.
*  You're out there when you hear it.
*  Then your feet start vibrating.
*  They took Chicago.
*  Boom.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what we have to look forward to.
*  The way this fucking goofy place is being run.
*  They're pushing us closer and closer to something real.
*  So my luck that as soon as I come to America, the fucking country collapses, huh?
*  It's not collapsing, but boy, it's in a weird state of this strange struggle
*  where people kind of forgot we're all supposed to be united.
*  And that's our strength.
*  And being divided the way we're being divided, especially being divided by bullshit.
*  You know, you shouldn't be allowed to lie.
*  And you shouldn't be allowed to lie in a campaign ad.
*  And you shouldn't be allowed to use CGI to make your crowds look bigger.
*  You shouldn't be allowed to do any of these things.
*  And we're allowing it.
*  We're allowing it.
*  And it's having this tremendous impact on the way people see the news.
*  The news is so filtered.
*  Everything in this country that's in mainstream news,
*  you have to follow a certain set of rules in order to be able to get information out.
*  And if you want to talk about the campaigns and if you want to talk about the war
*  and if you want to talk about what's going on in Ukraine and what's going on in Gaza,
*  you have to have very specific narratives.
*  And you're not allowed to deviate from that at all.
*  And then that's what's giving you the news.
*  And so we're all like, what the fuck is real?
*  And so anytime anything happens, even when the president gets shot,
*  we're like, was that even real?
*  Like, we don't think anything's real anymore.
*  And that's what primes us for the matrix.
*  When no one knows what anything's real anymore,
*  it's so much easier to just slide right in, Ari.
*  Slide right in, Ari.
*  And ah, we're in.
*  Fuck the world, dude.
*  I'm in a secure apartment complex.
*  It's level five security.
*  There's bank vault doors that lock to make sure the marauders don't get in while you're connected.
*  And you can just be free in this other world and ride around in your dragon on Pandora.
*  You know, you're fucking that blue lady with the hair.
*  Remember they connected hairs with the dragon?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, that's what's going to happen.
*  We're not paying attention to it because we're making this world such a goddamn mess
*  by not paying attention to what we're doing,
*  not paying attention to the really important things.
*  Like, don't let corporations tell you what's true.
*  They're not going to tell you what's true if they don't have to.
*  If they can get away with not telling you, if they make more money, if they don't tell you,
*  you can't have that.
*  That's not how you get your dues.
*  You can't have that because it's just too easy to manipulate.
*  So easy to manipulate.
*  News trading is illegal, but that's legal?
*  That's legal?
*  You can manipulate the news?
*  Like what?
*  You can have certain companies can advertise on the news and then you'll never criticize those companies?
*  That seems weird.
*  That seems weird.
*  Yeah, somebody was explaining how isn't it crazy that how any politician that wants to get elected
*  never mentions tobacco, alcohol, like never the...
*  Right.
*  The buzz, the back.
*  Yeah, you can't mention that shit.
*  Which is crazy.
*  You can kind of mention cigarettes because people are so stupid they're going to smoke them anyway.
*  It's just like, you can kind of get away with, we should, cigarettes are terrible, no one should smoke.
*  Yeah.
*  As soon as they can figure out like a spray, like an inhaler, they're completely clean.
*  They outlawed those a long time ago, which is weird.
*  Outlawed what?
*  Cigarette ads, or like commercials on TV and radio.
*  Do they still have them on the internet?
*  We haven't had tobacco or alcohol commercials for like 10 years now.
*  Yeah, I don't think we...
*  They used to only be in magazines.
*  And then your cigarette packs are so cool, it's like a throwback to my childhood
*  because it's like the red beautiful marble design in Europe and Australia and they have like the cancer on it.
*  And you have photos of like tumors and shit.
*  Dead baby.
*  Premature babies.
*  Lung, black lung.
*  I'd like to see what else those people were doing.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  They're blaming it on cigarettes, that guy is probably all fucked up in a lot of different ways.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  But, I mean, you can criticize tobacco and no one really cares because people are going to keep smoking.
*  As long as it's legal.
*  It's like alcohol.
*  People are not going to stop drinking, shut up.
*  They're not going to.
*  They want to drink.
*  They're having it out with friends, have a cocktail, clink, salute.
*  You know, congratulations, yay, clink glasses.
*  They're not, people like doing that.
*  They're not going to stop.
*  And part of the excitement of the clink is the fact that it's bad.
*  Little bit.
*  Come on.
*  Little bit.
*  That's the...
*  It's part of the fun.
*  Yeah, it's part of the fun.
*  Little bit.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  It's a little bit of let's have fun.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, it's a good feeling when you're with friends and you have a couple of cocktails
*  and you're laughing your ass off like, dude, it's a good feeling.
*  But you shouldn't do it every goddamn day.
*  It shouldn't be your whole life.
*  You shouldn't be drinking 12 hours a day every day.
*  But that's why it's so exciting is that life is not infinite and you do take those small
*  risks and that's what's so exciting.
*  Also, people that do drink 20 hours a day, those people in your life, in your journey,
*  those people are examples where you can learn something without having to actually do it
*  yourself.
*  Like you don't have to become an alcoholic and ruin your life, but you can see someone
*  do it and say, OK, my stepdad was a bad one.
*  Ooh, bad.
*  One of those were in the mornings.
*  He's because your system is, you know, your system is done in the mornings in the bathroom.
*  He would take two to three hours of like shitting, the shitting and then just heaving, you know,
*  because your body is just rejecting all this poison.
*  Oh, God.
*  So you hear him throw up every day.
*  Every day.
*  Oh, my God.
*  You know, there's no throw up left, but it's just the heaving.
*  Oh, and then put on a suit, put on a suit, bloated as fuck.
*  Put on a suit, all happy puppy, survived for eight hours.
*  And then he would, I remember he would come home and as a child, he would come home and
*  he would be in the car and just sit there in his car and I would see him sit there.
*  And as a child, yeah, as a child, you're like, oh, he's just taking a moment.
*  Maybe you don't understand that this guy's barely keeping it together.
*  Yeah.
*  Because he's about to go down a rabbit and he's fighting the rabbit hole every day.
*  He's just like, I don't want to.
*  And then if you're drinking all the time, all the time, always small vodka bottles,
*  small vodka bottles all the time.
*  Get them quick little airline ones.
*  Yeah.
*  And the his hands, you know, when the sobriety starts coming.
*  Ooh, sketchy disease.
*  It was bad.
*  It was bad.
*  And but but as a child, you're like, oh my God, I never want to do that.
*  But when you start getting gold, was he ever happy when he was drunk?
*  There was a tipping point.
*  The way to become happy.
*  No, it was like the first drink is always happy because your addiction is giving you
*  all green lights.
*  Right.
*  When you have an addiction, the first hit of that substance, right.
*  All your body's saying is less.
*  It's all green lights, baby.
*  This is the night.
*  This is the night.
*  Yes.
*  Let's fucking go because it's your addiction.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's fucking rock and roll whiskey.
*  But then, you know, as a child growing up in that environment, there would always be
*  that point where you see him on the couch and that look, you know, an alcoholic's look
*  is, you know, the detachment of the soul.
*  Yeah.
*  It's dangerous.
*  Look, it's then it's time for you to go to your room, you know, and just hang out there
*  and wait for the storm to pass.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like and it was like, yeah, there was always that point.
*  It's like it's such a creepy fucking and when you're a child, you're like, oh, don't do
*  that.
*  But when you start getting older, you also feel like start feeling empathetic of like,
*  you know, I don't know the life he lived as well.
*  You know, substance abuse always works with trauma really well.
*  They go hand to hand.
*  So this guy's childhood, you know, the more which is true, which is true because I hated
*  him.
*  I fucking hate him.
*  He was, you know,
*  If he's drinking heavily, it also could be like family influenced.
*  Like, see, that's what I found out later.
*  Behavior when you're young.
*  Absolutely.
*  That's what I found out later that he was in.
*  I thought I'm in a dark spot when he's home, you know,
*  I had friends that became alcoholics that didn't necessarily have childhood trauma as
*  much as they had childhood influence.
*  And then friends that kind of all went down a bad road and they were all like doing hard
*  drugs and drinking a lot.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, it just becomes a part of the culture of your little community.
*  If you're hanging with a group of people that just like to get fucked up all the time.
*  Yeah, it can.
*  I've seen it suck good people in.
*  Like everybody wants to say that there's like some sort of a reason why you get sucked into
*  it.
*  I have had friends that have nothing wrong in their life.
*  They're happy people and they take oxys and they don't want to stop taking them.
*  Jesus, they get injured.
*  Something happens.
*  They take them.
*  They don't want to stop.
*  They don't want to stop.
*  They feel good.
*  They don't want to stop.
*  And essentially oxycodone, we learned this recently, is what Hitler was taking during
*  the war.
*  They were giving him a form of oxycodone.
*  We had this gentleman on the podcast the other day that, what was his name again?
*  Book's on right in front of you.
*  Oh, here it is.
*  Norman Oehler.
*  Norman, sorry, Norman.
*  Norman Oehler.
*  This is all about Hitler's drug use during World War II.
*  But he was talking about that video and he didn't think that video was real.
*  I was like, why do you think that?
*  Because he had a direct, like a line of history between when Hitler gets introduced to this
*  one doctor and the drugs this doctor's giving him.
*  And that's the Olympic Games one.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's 36 that should be before all that stuff happened in his mind.
*  But I'm of the opinion that Hitler, if you can get him to go on oxycodone a year from
*  now, he's probably trying some shit that he didn't tell you about.
*  That's what I would imagine.
*  So the doctor, he's getting notes from the doctor who treated Hitler.
*  How the fuck do we know how honest Hitler was with that doctor?
*  He was probably already taking a bunch of shit.
*  They already knew that stuff was real.
*  And when you're a leader, you don't want any of that information out there, you know,
*  that you're fucking.
*  Also, there was zero stigma when they first created meth.
*  Oh, amphetamines.
*  Oh, when they were all.
*  Yeah.
*  And he Norman was showing us this.
*  What was it called?
*  Purvadin group?
*  Is that the right name?
*  So they had a literal brand of methamphetamine that they would sell in.
*  This is commercials.
*  You know, those German commercials.
*  I've seen those fucking crazy.
*  I remember taking meth for productivity.
*  Yeah.
*  They were taking a low dose of meth and they were giving it to the soldiers.
*  His this Blitz book is insane because it's a story about how the Nazis were jacked up
*  on meth and they just went all the way through Poland in three days and that they just never
*  they never slept.
*  They just kept marching.
*  I used to have a bit that, you know, while Germans were testing with meth, you guys in
*  America were testing with LST.
*  And I would have loved to see those two armies meet.
*  By the way, no, that's another part of this thing.
*  The Nazis were testing with LST as well.
*  They were running tests on the prisoners.
*  They were running tests on concentration camp prisoners.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They were.
*  Yeah.
*  The test never came to fulfillment because the prison camps got liberated, but they were
*  doing it.
*  They had record of them doing that with LST.
*  But meth is the perfect war drug.
*  If you think of it, you just fucking get amped up and jump into a ditch with a bayonet.
*  Right.
*  You're going to go.
*  You need some meth to have a bayonet.
*  100 percent.
*  100 percent.
*  That's the right drug for a good soldier.
*  At the front of the line.
*  And they had different dosages for different people.
*  So if someone was in a tank, they get the most.
*  They get the most meth because they're fucking, let's fucking go.
*  That's the front of the line.
*  You know, they're the ones that are going to get attacked first.
*  They have to be the most messed up.
*  And who you put on LST, the guy who plans the attack or something.
*  Do you know that in was it Iraq or Afghanistan where soldiers were listening to like death
*  metal while they were operating tanks?
*  If you see, if you're seeing videos of dudes like operating from inside of tanks.
*  And it's death metal.
*  That's gonna be the craziest job the world has ever known.
*  You're in a giant metal box, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.
*  And you're moving it towards war and you're hoping that thing doesn't break.
*  You hope it doesn't break and leave you out there.
*  You're hoping that when it gets shot at or who knows, the transmission fails, and then
*  you're out there in enemy territory while they're shooting missiles at you.
*  I've always thought that because the Germans were the first ones with a tank, with a Panzer, right?
*  That was correct, right?
*  I don't know.
*  I think so.
*  I think so.
*  And I remember always thinking like, imagine like being like a Russian Russian soldier or
*  something and you're with like a bolt action rifle and you see that fucking thing.
*  You hear a crack, crack, crack.
*  You don't even know what the fuck that is.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like a car.
*  But then you see and do that feel clunk.
*  Nothing.
*  Cluck, cluck, clunk.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  A tank.
*  A tank.
*  What an insane idea.
*  It's basically what the scene is from the Western Front.
*  Oh, pretty fucking badass.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Not a great time to watch it because we're doing a podcast, but.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Oh, exactly.
*  The first time they see the tank.
*  Look at this.
*  Fuck.
*  Look at this.
*  Imagine.
*  You can't stop them.
*  It's literally like seeing a transformer right now.
*  Like if you would see.
*  This is nuts.
*  And nobody told you.
*  Right.
*  It's a good movie to watch.
*  Yeah, nobody.
*  I watch it.
*  It's an amazing movie.
*  I heard it's awesome.
*  I heard it's awesome.
*  That's the new one, right?
*  Yeah, it's different from the book slightly, but it's still.
*  Sad.
*  Yeah, well, I'm sure.
*  There's no happy war movies.
*  That's how you know no movies bullshit.
*  Some American ones are fucking awesome.
*  Black, Hop Down, Jarhead.
*  Those are all fucking amazing, dude.
*  The Pink Mist.
*  Missing in action.
*  Chuck Norris.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  It goes back to Vietnam.
*  Bring people back.
*  The American movies made.
*  It was the karate kicks in the jungle with cowboy boots on.
*  American movies made.
*  War seemed the coolest shit ever.
*  Not always.
*  Saving Private Ryan certainly didn't.
*  Yeah, fair.
*  That was like it.
*  Full Metal Jacket certainly didn't.
*  Yeah.
*  That's my favorite.
*  That is a good one.
*  I haven't watched that one.
*  I don't know all the war movies.
*  I was too young when I saw it.
*  The Apocalypse Now.
*  Here it is.
*  This is Missing in Action.
*  Chuck Norris just pops out of the air.
*  He's right around on an inflatable fucking thing.
*  See, this is the America I grew up in.
*  They're all shooting at a bitch you can't hit.
*  He's Chuck Norris.
*  It's a boat and they're shooting at a boat and nothing happens.
*  It's a rubber boat.
*  They can't even come close to hitting them.
*  Then they go chase after them.
*  Guess what's going to happen?
*  I'll tell you right now.
*  Chuck Norris is going to fuck them up because he's Chuck Norris.
*  Oh my God.
*  He jumps in like Aquaman.
*  What the fuck?
*  He thinks they got him.
*  Look at him.
*  Bitch, you didn't get Chuck Norris.
*  I mean, these movies are amazing.
*  Amazing.
*  They're amazing because they're almost like you're watching a cartoon.
*  But then you can get like Full Metal Jacket, which is that's an intense, that's a totally
*  different experience.
*  That's war, I think, in a much more realistic light.
*  For sure.
*  What those people experienced.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Can you imagine being a fucking kid?
*  Back in the 60s when you didn't really have any way of knowing what the fuck was actually
*  going on.
*  And also, yeah, they're saying that the fucking end of the world's coming and you're the last
*  frontier.
*  You know, you have no way to check it.
*  And even questioning it would be in bad taste.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, you're not supposed to.
*  And the people are labeled traitors like Muhammad Ali.
*  That is true.
*  They send you over there.
*  That the American troops.
*  Oh, yeah, that's a crazy.
*  Bro, Deneb, I saw this too.
*  Yeah, I saw this too.
*  Yeah, I have to fucking talk.
*  I remember that scene when he was in the bathroom before he shot himself in the face with his
*  toe through the fucking rifle.
*  Yeah.
*  That is true that the American troops were much more because you've never been invaded.
*  So at least our trauma that we heard from grandfathers and Shetwood Swanns, they were
*  the most brutal.
*  They were the most brutal.
*  They were the most brutal.
*  They were the most brutal.
*  They were the most brutal.
*  At least our trauma that we heard from grandfathers and Shetwood Swanns about, like it was almost
*  a heroic thing of standing up for your country.
*  Whereas American maybe, it's kind of like, why are you going there?
*  And that trauma must be bad when you're coming back because they told you that it's, you're
*  the fucking, you have to save the world basically.
*  Well, they were telling them that they had to fight the communists.
*  They told them that the communist North Korea had attacked a boat, an American boat that
*  never happened, the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They just made up this story.
*  So they made up this propaganda bullshit and they created a false flag.
*  And through that, they justified us going into war and it went on for a long fucking
*  time and it didn't make any sense.
*  And no one today thinks it made any sense.
*  No one today thinks it makes a good idea or it was a good idea rather.
*  Unless you're some insane war lover.
*  Anybody look at Vietnam, Vietnam overall is a net positive because here's what we got
*  out of Vietnam.
*  This is what came out of that war.
*  Okay, first of all, the culture shifted.
*  That's how it needed to happen.
*  Like you couldn't even come up with justifications.
*  Why would we go into this country and fire bomb them and spray Agent Orange and who knows
*  how many people come home with fucking cancer because you used a deforestation technique
*  that's like this horrific chemical that kills people.
*  Crazy.
*  It's nuts.
*  It's nuts.
*  And they did it because people back then didn't have any access to information.
*  There was no way to know.
*  There was no exposés showing that, you know, this is not a real attack.
*  There's no reason for us to be over there.
*  There's other things involved here that's causing people to want to send U.S.
*  troops to Vietnam and probably none of them good for you.
*  Like you really, as a United States citizen, best served, the world would be best served
*  with you right here.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  You need to go over there and fire bomb a village because someone told you to.
*  You don't need to go over there and fucking climb into a tunnel and go and try to fight
*  some Viet Cong guy in there.
*  This is insane.
*  Why are you there?
*  Makes no sense.
*  But they tricked people and they did it for a long ass time.
*  It went on for years.
*  And so the fact that they can still pull it off today, that they can still, I mean, who
*  knows today, like what we're going to look back on like we look at the Gulf of Tonkin
*  incident or what we're going to look back on and realize that it had been manipulated
*  so the event was real, but the event was caused by a series of moves behind the scenes to
*  ensure that war takes place.
*  There's so much complication when it comes to these things because there's so much money
*  being thrown around.
*  And then at least today we have other outlets for information.
*  At least today you can kind of get a sense of how things are true or not true based on
*  really intelligent people that you know that are online that are talking about them and
*  you go, no, it's actually this.
*  Like with that female boxer, like that was a big one, right?
*  Where everybody's like, okay, what is going on?
*  Is that a female?
*  Is that a male?
*  Is that someone has XY chromosomes?
*  I saw that information that it was the XY thing early, but it was just a Levine of
*  that it's a man just came a bit too strong because the both information came out pretty
*  much I would in my sources, I would say I saw similar time where it was like, oh, it's
*  a man, but then you just open another scroll a bit more and then you see the XY chromosome
*  thingy and then you're like, okay, but just a Levine of that it's a dude came on a bit
*  strong.
*  Well, XY chromosome is male.
*  Yeah, yeah, it's that male.
*  The definition of like was because I think the first the first reaction was that it's
*  a man transitioning to a woman.
*  Right.
*  That's what people thought initially.
*  And then they realized, no, this is someone who has a genetic issue.
*  But the there was another there's a boxing committee that had I'm going to send you this
*  Jamie because this kind of makes it all make like a little bit more sense.
*  But it was essentially that there's there's different versions of these kinds of diseases
*  that people have.
*  And depending on those versions, some of them, they're just there.
*  They go through male puberty and they have male frames and they're male.
*  But when they're born, they have significant issues.
*  Okay, so here it is.
*  I found it and I'll send it to Jamie.
*  It's European vice president of the World Boxing Organization has come forward to confirm
*  that Algerian boxer and main cleave is male.
*  This person said he warned the Olympic Committee about several male boxers in the women's category,
*  but nothing was done.
*  Who knows?
*  You know, I don't I don't have any direct information about whether that is a male or
*  female.
*  Let's just say that one, two slaps.
*  One two is not bad, but also that person's lost before.
*  Yeah, to female boxers.
*  But here's the thing.
*  But that doesn't that doesn't mean that like there's a lot of girls out there, boys, that
*  can kick your ass.
*  Exactly.
*  There are, you know, get in the ring with a man of Nunes.
*  Good luck, bitch.
*  She'll fuck you up.
*  And she's a woman.
*  Right.
*  There's women that are really, really good.
*  And this person might not be that good.
*  But it seems like they went through male puberty, which should exclude you from competing as
*  a woman.
*  They look male.
*  They have male frame.
*  They have X, Y chromosome.
*  You're being told that you're a bigot for looking at very obvious.
*  What we have always considered biological representations, right?
*  Like what what is it?
*  What is it in biology when something is a male human being?
*  Do they have an X X chromosome or do they have an X, Y?
*  They say, well, they have an X, Y. Well, we know that.
*  But saying that makes you a bigot, which is insanity.
*  As a sports commissioner, that's very black and white for me, at least a chromosomal issue.
*  That's what the enhanced games as a human.
*  I do feel empathetic towards her.
*  You know, it's just it's a bit of a pickle.
*  But I don't necessarily know if that's a her.
*  This is the problem.
*  What they're saying, it's a male with a sexually some developmental disease that they or developmental
*  an issue, some genetic anomaly, something that happens.
*  But they're going they have testes and they go through male puberty and they don't have
*  the ability to get pregnant.
*  Yeah, I don't even know if they have ovaries.
*  Do they have ovaries?
*  I don't know.
*  In this situation, I don't think they have eggs.
*  I'm reading a version that CBS Sports put out where they talked to the International
*  Olympics Committee and the IBA.
*  They're saying these tests are not legitimate tests.
*  Yeah, I was going to bring this up to they were saying that some people think that it's
*  because the Soviets did them.
*  They don't trust them.
*  So the International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said in a press conference on Sunday,
*  the tests themselves, the process of the tests and the ad hoc nature of the tests are not
*  legitimate.
*  The testing, the method of the testing, the idea of the testing, which happened kind of
*  overnight, none of it is legitimate.
*  And this does not deserve any response.
*  That's by saying it's not legitimate is a very weird thing.
*  I had read it came up after this event where she beat an undefeated boxer and then people
*  got mad.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But did this person, let's Google this then, did this person, this boxer, did they take
*  a chromosome test?
*  Do you see that article that I saw?
*  This article says that that originally, right here, originally the test was kept confidential.
*  Did not go on, did not undergo a testosterone examination, but were subject to a separate
*  and recognized test whereby the specifics remain confidential.
*  Then the next day or like Monday, I don't know how many days later that was.
*  Then they came out and said something different.
*  These testing show they have a high level of testosterone.
*  Kremlin said like men, they have men's level of testosterone.
*  Cannot go further in our investigation.
*  Whether they were born like men or some changes intervene at the later stages.
*  And then that's where the IOC said what you read earlier, where this test are not legitimate.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But they're not saying why they're not legitimate.
*  This is what gives me pause.
*  When they just keep saying it's not legitimate, the ad hoc nature of the tests are not legitimate.
*  You have to say when you're talking about a scientific test, there's some test that's
*  repeatable, right?
*  So if you can test for XY chromosome versus XX chromosome, do it.
*  Tell me what the results are.
*  If you can test for testosterone, do it.
*  Tell me what the results are.
*  And if one says male, says XY, and the other one says high levels of testosterone, that's
*  not a woman.
*  Sports, sports wise, yeah.
*  Absolutely.
*  Sports wise.
*  Yeah.
*  They want to slap with their shoulders.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's also, it's like what are we doing?
*  Like why do we have women's sports in the first place if you let...
*  I mean, you could say that some people have a genetic anomaly, like that woman, she had
*  XY, right?
*  She was like a legitimate hermaphrodite, I believe.
*  Testosterone levels, not XY chromosome, which is the pattern typically seen in men, are
*  the key criteria of eligibility in Olympic events where the sports governing body has
*  framed and approved rules.
*  That's interesting.
*  But it's the same thing with when like totally, I mean, genetically women start doing steroids.
*  That's the whole thing about women's sports is the big problem.
*  I remember like...
*  Once they do it, they change their frame.
*  I'm not making accusations, but Chris Cyborg, I remember, was a big thing in Strike Force
*  where it was the first time I saw where I was like, this is a big loophole in women's
*  sports right now, especially combat sports because it's about doing actually physical
*  damage.
*  100%.
*  It's very visibly seen the difference.
*  In other sports where it's reaction time and whatever, tennis or whatever, you might make
*  the argument of like, just get better at the technique, you know?
*  But in combat, it's very visible because it's not only about the body and whatever.
*  It's literally people who are on testosterone has been proven harder to KO because you're
*  just ramped up.
*  Testosterone, it's literally like the gold particle in the sense of fucking sports.
*  They've stopped some fighters from fighting because they tested so hard.
*  Absolutely.
*  They're like, get out of here.
*  These fucking guys.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember it was Jelson and Alistair Overham.
*  They used to fail tests where it was like the number, it's like there's the rage of
*  18 men coming at you right now.
*  Well, that's Vitor Belfort in his prime, right?
*  The TRT Vitor days.
*  I only compete in Brazil.
*  I want to be home.
*  Oh, sure.
*  If you were a demon, he would come at you like a demon.
*  Yeah.
*  He would have those videos where he was like an elliptical machine.
*  And he was...
*  The thing about this too, it's like if they're saying they're testing for testosterone levels,
*  how often are you doing that?
*  Because guess what?
*  It's easy to make your testosterone levels crash.
*  Real easy.
*  Well, the whole thing is always that it's that the testings.
*  You can, it's like, it's like pirating.
*  They're always a step ahead.
*  They're always.
*  So the only thing you have to do to kill your testosterone levels are drink alcohol, eat
*  shitty food and don't get any sleep.
*  Or just fucking live in the mountains of Dagestan and hope the connection flight is a bit late.
*  That's...
*  Dude.
*  That's the ultimate conspiracy theory.
*  Oh, very interesting that you went to a training camp.
*  Yeah, they're the best wrestlers.
*  Very interesting.
*  Well, they are the best wrestlers.
*  True, but...
*  Jacked.
*  Yeah.
*  So, is that what you're saying?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I would imagine that if they knew for a fact that you couldn't get to the North
*  Pole to do a drug test.
*  Yeah.
*  There'd be a fucking MMA camp on the North Pole.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, I went to a camp in Thailand back in the day and I remember over there it was like
*  not even a secret.
*  Really?
*  I go to that camp and it's like American fighters would be there.
*  And everybody would know that that's why they're doing it?
*  No, no, no.
*  They'd be like, who would be handing out shots at a bar?
*  Who wants the syringe?
*  What are we doing?
*  Wow.
*  And then there's not...
*  Dude, these are all retards that are smoking joints and sparring.
*  There's nobody doing like, we need to do...
*  It's like, nah, fucking give me what you got.
*  And are these people pros?
*  Semi-pro.
*  Semi-pro, yeah.
*  You live in a Honda Civic and every once in a while you move back to your parents' place
*  because it's...
*  Fighting's hard.
*  Fighting's really hard, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  Woo-wee!
*  It's hard, dude.
*  So you...
*  This is so people don't know you.
*  When did you start doing stand-up comedy?
*  Were you fighting at the same time you were doing stand-up comedy?
*  Did they overlap?
*  There was a transitionary period.
*  And I started...
*  Okay, so this is my martial arts history.
*  Of course, as I mentioned, had a stepdad who was fucking crazy.
*  So there was that insecurity.
*  You know, there's that thing of like...
*  I'm not saying that having a father who's maybe violent towards your mother is a bit
*  better, but I think there's a bit of a more evolutionary connection that a family dynamic
*  can have.
*  Whereas if you're like a 12 to 13, 14-year-old boy and a new guy, you're supposed to be the
*  man of the house, even though you're a child.
*  It's my sister and my mother and it's our dynamic.
*  And a new guy moves in and this retard is now...
*  And he's an alcoholic.
*  Yeah.
*  And that creates, obviously, an insecurity.
*  So you know, you have a deep sadness in the house.
*  Tension.
*  No, dude.
*  I would still...
*  No.
*  My mom, Riff City.
*  My mom has always been Riff City.
*  She was always having fun throughout all the darkness in our life.
*  We had some rough periods, you know.
*  But in my house, it's always been Fun City.
*  It's always been my humor.
*  I would have points where it's me and my mother on a fucking...
*  Because we would just leave the house during the night.
*  We just walk towards...
*  My sister was a bit older, so she moved out.
*  So we would just walk in the night towards the direction and she would try to call all
*  her friends where to stay for the night because this ape is fucking going bananas back home.
*  And we would be on the sidewalk.
*  So what did you start out with?
*  What was the first martial art that you...
*  And the next day I would go to school and still be fucking happy puppy just because,
*  I don't know, that was how we came up, right?
*  So then there was this program called Kick Ass Martial Arts and it was Chris Crudelli,
*  this guy.
*  Soul Patch, British guy.
*  He would travel the world.
*  And this was at a point where Pride and UFC were happening, but in traditional martial
*  arts were still holding on.
*  Wing Chun was holding on.
*  Aikido was holding on.
*  Kung Fu was kind of...
*  It was kind of going away, you know?
*  But Chris Crudelli had a program where he would travel the world and study these ancient...
*  There was this dim muck where it's like...
*  Ha!
*  And seven years later you die of cancer.
*  You know all that shit?
*  And as a kid, I'm like, oh, that's all I gotta do.
*  Move to Korea for two weeks, study this fucking Death Dutch and just come back and kill somebody.
*  But then I remember I saw UFC...
*  I saw a few Pride fights from Fedor Emelianenko because he was Russian and he was a big prominent
*  figure in the martial arts community.
*  But I remember I saw Lyoto Machida Shogun, the first one.
*  And in my head, because Machida looked like a traditional martial artist, you know, because
*  he was half Asian or something, you know?
*  So in my head I'm like, why don't these people do the Chris Crudelli shit, you know?
*  Fucking neutralize your opponent to a wrist lock.
*  Then I started watching Pride, Wanderlei Silva.
*  He's stomping people, holding onto the ropes, stomping.
*  And in my head I'm like, why doesn't he do the dim muck?
*  You know, hi!
*  And you fucking...
*  So then I was maybe 15, 16, late, late, when I was doing gymnastics and I was doing a bit
*  of weightlifting and I saw dudes like wrestling, you know?
*  And I started thinking like Greco-Roman and I saw them like suplex, jacked guys in fucking
*  just suplexing each other.
*  And that's where the wheels start turning of like, dude, you're not going to wrist lock
*  this guy.
*  You're not going to, you know, I'm not going to death touch this guy.
*  This guy's going to run through me.
*  So I joined a gym, SPG, subsidiary gym, Preet Mikkelson, shout out my man.
*  He was a great mentor and a father figure at that time for me.
*  And I joined his gym.
*  And it was Jiu Jitsu, MMA, we did everything together, you know?
*  And I had my first amateur fight like five months into like doing it.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  Now, did they make sure that the person you fought didn't have a lot of experience either?
*  Yes, but he was like 34.
*  Oh no!
*  Yeah.
*  That's not fair.
*  And he went to war.
*  He was like a former military, he stood down a tank.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  But he was still amateur rules, but still MMA gloves, fucking haymaker city, you know?
*  Right.
*  Was he good?
*  Yeah, he choked me just like I didn't tap, I didn't tap, I didn't tap.
*  Never tapped.
*  I tried to tap, I was too late.
*  But yeah, I would not recommend that.
*  I would not recommend you getting your ass kicked by someone who has a lot more experience
*  at five months in.
*  I always think you got to give...
*  I think we were the same experience in martial arts, but he was a man.
*  Dude, I'm a suburban boy.
*  Was he though?
*  Let me tell you something, if he got to be how old?
*  30 something?
*  And he went to war, that dude's had training.
*  Yeah, I mean...
*  It's not just five months of training.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Fair.
*  Listen, that kind of guy is done a little bit here, a little bit there.
*  That kind of guy probably boxed a little when he was younger, did a little karate.
*  We were such a small community that I still trained with him, I remember.
*  Oh wow.
*  Yeah, but I was fine.
*  So he was nice to you after he choked you to sleep?
*  No, before, I mean.
*  Oh, you trained with him before?
*  Yeah, it was such a small community, you know.
*  So I wouldn't say the skill discrepancy was actually that big, but it was just...
*  When you go to war and you can be in a competition, I'm having a full on panic attack.
*  You know, I'm fucking first time in a fucking hand to hand combat situation.
*  He's a man.
*  This guy's stared down a tank.
*  How old were you at the time?
*  16.
*  Yeah, that's not fair.
*  Yeah.
*  And also like a pussy 16.
*  I have a brother like a Pakistani 16 where it's like hair on my knuckles and I have two kids.
*  Those are like the real mothers.
*  Dude, whenever you would in those amateur circuits, whenever it's like...
*  I don't know if Americans do that, but like if you say you're fighting an American, do
*  you guys slip in that it's like, it's Jerome, you know, it's you're going to just so you're
*  ready it's going to be a bit of explosive opponent.
*  Like in Estonia, it's like if you're fighting a Russian guy, are you fighting Ivan?
*  Who's like me?
*  He's a Russian guy.
*  Or are you fighting somebody whose names ends with a M-M-Metov?
*  It's a very different, it's still Russia.
*  Yeah, mountain Russians.
*  We say from the hills.
*  Yeah, we always say from the hills.
*  Like it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a different double leg that's going to come at you.
*  Wow, dude.
*  Did you see that Corey Sandhagen, Umar, Nirmakumar fight?
*  Of course, of course.
*  Ooh, so high level.
*  I felt bad for Sandhagen.
*  He was wrestling so well, everything correctly.
*  It was everything.
*  Sandhagen was cool.
*  He didn't get backed up into the corner too early.
*  He was keeping his distance.
*  He had good knees and good jujitsu.
*  What I liked about Sandhagen in that fight, he used jujitsu.
*  He used proper jujitsu.
*  And for the first two rounds, it's exactly like the Khabib thing.
*  The first two rounds, you can actually out hustle, not out hustle him, but you can, you
*  can just, you can be explosive enough to create those moments of jujitsu where you can stay
*  safe.
*  But that train just keeps coming.
*  Train keeps coming.
*  Just fucking keeps coming and mean.
*  And you know the difference in Umar versus Khabib is that Umar is, his stand up is, his
*  so dynamic, his kicking is so dynamic.
*  It's so dangerous and quick.
*  You know, like he throws head kicks off the front leg quick.
*  He throws things that are fast.
*  Yeah, he threw that front switch kick.
*  Not even a switch.
*  He just slapped it out there.
*  Yeah, dude, he's good.
*  He's fucking real good.
*  His striking was on point.
*  Like everything was on point and he's more threatening wrestling.
*  It's like it was a more potent combination of the skills that Corey has as well.
*  I mean, he's a, he's, Sandhagen's brilliant.
*  He's one of the best fighters in the sport, in my opinion.
*  So to see a guy like Umar beat him, you're like, wow, that's hot.
*  And to come on strong in the fourth and the fifth, that guy's, that guy's fucking good,
*  man.
*  And him versus O'Malley would be wild.
*  Wild.
*  Or Marab.
*  Him versus Marab will be wild too.
*  Well, Marab and him, I want to see more because Marab is also a bully.
*  You know, Marab is a different, it's like he's really different.
*  He's made out of different stuff.
*  They say Marab trains hard, like right up until the fight.
*  But you can see that.
*  You can see that.
*  With a guy like that, you're always like, okay, how long can your joints hold out?
*  Exactly.
*  How long is it going to be before your back goes?
*  Because your will will carry you through.
*  If the human body wasn't so goddamn fragile, guys like that would never get beat.
*  Never get beat.
*  Exactly.
*  That's the whole thing.
*  Like Cain Velasquez, when his body started going.
*  Also Marab's been dropped and hurt.
*  I think it was Marlon Verho, who hurt him.
*  Marais.
*  Bad.
*  Marlon Marais.
*  Bad.
*  Had him really badly.
*  And then stopped him in the next round.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Well, Marais had that thing where.
*  Poor bastard.
*  This guy feels so bad for him because he was so good.
*  So good.
*  But just it's such a chaotic sport where a few bad fights just can have such a tremendous
*  impact to your fights that the next ones, you know.
*  Well, the Sahuda fight, man, the first round, he was lighting Henry up.
*  Lighting him up.
*  Where I was like, if this guy can keep this up for five rounds, Henry's going to get stopped.
*  Henry just came on in the second round like an animal and beat the shit out of him.
*  He closed the distance.
*  Marlon had a lot of fights like that.
*  He had one in PFL too.
*  With that left hook and that switch kick.
*  He KO'd Aljamain Sterling.
*  Oh yeah, man.
*  Bad.
*  Bad.
*  He KO'd Aljamain bad.
*  Went for a switch kick to the body, Aljamain shot in the knee.
*  But then once he lost to Henry, he started losing to a lot of folks.
*  A lot.
*  And now it's like.
*  Yeah.
*  Sandhagen dropped him with a wheel kick.
*  Remember that?
*  Yeah, that was a bad one too.
*  Right to the temple.
*  Yeah, that's just shows the skill diversity that guy has.
*  He could do everything.
*  Sandhagen's so good.
*  So to watch Umar beat him, I'm like, God damn, Umar's the truth.
*  He's the truth.
*  It's like those guys in that part of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're so frustrating because it's not like an incredible thing that they're doing.
*  If you watch somebody like Conor McGregor who has that fucking death touch, it's such
*  a spectacle.
*  It's like, oh my God, this guy has the power.
*  But these guys just out hustle you, out grind you.
*  And they keep coming.
*  They keep coming.
*  Annoying and bully and mean.
*  But then you got guys like Islam that could do everything.
*  And Umar, this is the difference.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, Islam is scary standing up.
*  In the beginning of his career, he was really good at wrestling, not as good at standing
*  up, but now he's just as good at standing up.
*  When you KO Volkanovsky like that, and then you choke out Dustin Poirier like that, that's
*  the full thing.
*  He can head kick you.
*  He could strike with you and knock you.
*  Knocked out Glacier Tebow with one shot standing.
*  He can knock you out legitimately.
*  And he could still strangle you.
*  And he could still smother you.
*  It's the perfect combination.
*  But it's like, that is such a crazy strategy.
*  It's like you're out manning every guy you fight.
*  He's out grappling them, out striking them.
*  Most people like try to be like a specialist.
*  Exactly.
*  But they're like the full Marauder.
*  The full Marauder man.
*  I think if you wanted to like really think about like who's the most complete fighter,
*  you got to say like Max Holloway, Ilya Tuporiya, but Islam Akhachev.
*  You got to put it on top of the most complete.
*  He could KO you with a head kick.
*  Just like John Jones.
*  If John Jones is active.
*  Let's not forget the one true God.
*  If he's active.
*  John Jones.
*  That's my boy.
*  The problem with John is he's the most dangerous man who ever lived.
*  Unfortunately that shoulder injury and then the uncertainty about moving up in the heavyweight.
*  Like how's he going to deal with guys like Francis, which was always the big fight.
*  That was the big fight.
*  That was the fight that slipped between our fingers.
*  It was the Fador Brock Lesnar all over again.
*  That was the big one that slipped through our fingers.
*  That was the fight because you know the question is would Francis be able to keep John off
*  of him?
*  Exactly.
*  You know and would John be able to avoid the big strike standing?
*  Exactly.
*  You know there's a difference in size.
*  That's pretty significant.
*  You know even when John was getting big, it's a different kind of big.
*  You know like the 265 that Francis carries around.
*  That's a natural lean 265.
*  It's like I mean it's a cobalt mining or some shit.
*  No sand mines.
*  That's a different guy.
*  That dude's power is extraordinary.
*  Especially with them little gloves on.
*  You cannot get clipped by that guy.
*  So the question is would John be able to get a hold of Francis?
*  Would Francis be able to keep John off of him?
*  If Francis can keep John off of him, would Francis be able to stop those leg kicks?
*  Because John side kicks the shit out of people's knees and it'll fucking scare you because
*  it makes your leg hyper-extend.
*  It'll blow your knee out.
*  Mean.
*  I loved John Jones when he was mean.
*  Clover DeGerra with that overhook.
*  Remember that overhook that he had on the shoulder?
*  Yeah man.
*  Yeah.
*  Mean.
*  Elbows.
*  How about Tiago?
*  Tiago had to get two knee surgeries.
*  Both knees.
*  Guillotine with Machida.
*  As soon as he goes out.
*  Put him to sleep.
*  Just dropped him.
*  Yeah.
*  Well his run in the light heavyweight division was unprecedented.
*  Nothing like it.
*  Literally created for human combat.
*  His body looked insane.
*  Small torso with limbs coming out.
*  It looked insane.
*  If you saw his silhouette, it looks insane.
*  Right.
*  And how small his calves are.
*  Yeah.
*  They look tiny.
*  But yet tremendous strength.
*  And strong.
*  And the best guy ever at utilizing distance.
*  Strong mentally for sure.
*  Mentally.
*  And clever.
*  Clever.
*  Yeah we just have to see him back.
*  And apparently they're trying to do that thing.
*  It's supposed to be in Madison Square Garden, right?
*  Is that announced officially, young Jamie?
*  What's that?
*  John Jones versus Stipe, Madison Square Garden, November.
*  So it's being talked about.
*  Also no disrespect to Stipe, but I don't want to see that fight that badly as I want to
*  see.
*  You know.
*  I feel like you've got to give Stipe one more shot.
*  Okay.
*  I feel like the guy's been strung around for this long.
*  If you want to respect the history and the lineage of the UFC Heavyweight Championship.
*  You're right.
*  He's the most accomplished UFC Heavyweight of all time.
*  He defended the title more than anybody.
*  And you know, he stopped Daniel Cormier.
*  He's a legit fucking killer.
*  He stopped a lot of like very, very good people.
*  He stopped Junior Dos Santos.
*  And he also won Francis.
*  Yeah.
*  He beat Francis the first fight.
*  And he hurt him the second time.
*  Yeah.
*  But the second time it was a different Francis.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  One of the scariest KOs I've ever seen in my life.
*  In the Apex.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, being there live was incredible.
*  Oh you were there live.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So there was like a hundred people in that place.
*  When he followed up with the hammer fist to the neck area and that thud.
*  Bro, that left hook was, and it was like when Stipe was trying to like capitalize on a shot
*  he landed.
*  It's one of those victories where me and the boys were on the couch and it's not a woo,
*  it's a just a.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a yikes.
*  Because also you know how much damage Stipe has taken in his career.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  And Stipe hurts him.
*  There it is.
*  He hit him with that left hook and really hurt him there.
*  Yeah.
*  But Stipe also hurt him.
*  Stipe also hurt him.
*  Look at this.
*  And now Stipe goes oh.
*  And he thought he had it so he moved in.
*  The neck.
*  Ah yeah yeah yeah.
*  He thought he had him when he landed that right hand.
*  Ah.
*  Christ my lord.
*  So apparently he's gained a bunch of muscle.
*  Stipe has.
*  He's been lifting a lot.
*  And you know he hasn't fought in two years.
*  Thank God I'm doing comedy.
*  Yeah thank God.
*  But for me when I look at an older fighter like Stipe who's a legend.
*  That's kind of what I want.
*  I want a guy to take a long time off in between a bad KO and then you know no one's more disciplined
*  than that guy.
*  He's a very disciplined dedicated fighter.
*  That's why he was the most successful UFC heavyweight champion ever.
*  He's also 40 something years old right.
*  42 I think even.
*  OK.
*  So you've got to if you just look realistically at natural athletes when they get to that
*  age you have concerns like how much of their performance do they have left.
*  Like and it varies but it does last longer as a heavyweight.
*  Absolutely.
*  Heavyweights they can.
*  Because it doesn't the nervous system doesn't need to be as rapid fire.
*  Like a bantamweight.
*  Yeah yeah.
*  Like 42 year old bantamweight kind of done.
*  But George Foreman won the heavyweight title at 45.
*  So Bernard Hopkins.
*  Yeah but Bernard was a freak.
*  I just feel like as a fan and as a person who respects the sport you've got to give
*  Stipe a shot.
*  OK.
*  Especially when he was supposed to fight John and then John tore his shoulder.
*  See with me it's just like if it's a classic thing of it's the mean quote that Don King
*  used to have that why he when they asked him why he was like ripping off Mike Tyson he
*  was like you got to keep the lion hungry you know.
*  Oh God.
*  Imagine that's your justification for stealing money.
*  I know.
*  But Mike Tyson fought six times that year.
*  So that's true.
*  Right.
*  That's true.
*  But that is for some of those guys that that's not some.
*  As soon as.
*  Because you know I was a big corner guy SPG the lineage we were had the connection you
*  know.
*  And as soon as Connor started getting rich I was you know as soon as John Jones got rich
*  all of us at home.
*  Let me guess.
*  Never going to see you.
*  I don't think that's what happened with John.
*  With John there was a bunch of other factors.
*  True.
*  Absolutely.
*  And that's why that steeper fight is also exhilarating of like the traditional family
*  guy in the gym.
*  And then the other guy was the greatest psycho that's ever.
*  And I love it.
*  Good.
*  When he went to Vegas to get his Hall of Fame induction and just disappeared into the night.
*  I like the Aspen all.
*  How many milligrams of those.
*  Three.
*  Can I have one.
*  This is athletic nicotine is another company.
*  Somebody gave me eight milligrams yesterday.
*  I was having a panic attack.
*  That's too ridiculous.
*  That's too ridiculous.
*  I was having a panic attack at 2am.
*  I like I've cut my consumption quite a bit.
*  I like that fight.
*  I think John Jones and Tom Aspen all is an interesting fight.
*  But if we just.
*  Tom is a big fast heavyweight.
*  He's a fucking powerhouse man and he's big.
*  He's big as shit.
*  And big as shit.
*  If you look at fights where John has had difficulty.
*  Some of them have been like really elite strikers.
*  Like he had some difficulty with Leota Machida before he got on the first round.
*  He had some difficulty with Dominic Reyes.
*  Absolutely.
*  Dominic Reyes.
*  Some people even thought he lost that fight.
*  Absolutely.
*  Even Diago Silva.
*  No, not Silva.
*  Santos.
*  Santos.
*  That's the guy who would kick both his knees out.
*  Yeah.
*  But that was a split decision.
*  Yeah.
*  Even though Diago was hectic and temperamental in his exchanges.
*  Not like a refined striker.
*  But he's just super dangerous.
*  It created problems for John still.
*  That fucking sledgehammer that that dude has tattooed on his chest.
*  That's for real.
*  That's how hard he hits.
*  That's the dude had a sledgehammer tattooed on his tits.
*  It's amazing.
*  But that dude was scary.
*  But also with Aspen and John's.
*  Every time people say, dude, watching him and Cyril Gahn and all respect to Cyril Gahn,
*  but he never felt anything.
*  It was a made up guillotine even just on the cage.
*  He just was like, check this shit out.
*  Yeah, but as long as he gets a hold of your neck and he's doubling you up in that position
*  where he can press his chest on your head.
*  With a guy like John with his kind of squeeze, that's horrific.
*  A guy like Cyril Gahn that's only been grappling for like five years, you're going to get strangled.
*  It's just that even with John Jones, the heavyweight division has always been a shallow division
*  due to the reason of people being just that size of humans.
*  There's a very small percentage.
*  Including heavyweight boxing.
*  100%.
*  Did you see that guy Boccoli knockout Jared Anderson?
*  Holy shit, that Boccoli guy is terrifying.
*  Holy shit.
*  Holy shit.
*  I had heard about him from sparring sessions.
*  That was the first fight I saw.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  I watched the highlight reel of him on YouTube, but I'm not the biggest, like I don't know
*  all the fighters that are fighting.
*  I know a bunch, but I know like maybe 30% of boxing where I was compared to what I know
*  about MMA.
*  So I had heard about this guy from an article saying that no one wants to spar him.
*  And I was like, how come?
*  And then I watched him fight and I'm like, oh, well that's why.
*  Jesus Christ, he's 285 pounds.
*  He's six foot six, 285 pounds and takes a fucking tremendous shot.
*  And a lot of people thought this kid, Jared Anderson, he's only 24 and he's still very
*  talented.
*  But look at this fucking.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  And the bro that was round one.
*  Okay.
*  He dropped him in round one, but then he hit him with this sneaky ass uppercut.
*  I love how there's beach shorts on with pockets.
*  Watch this uppercut.
*  Look at this uppercut, dude.
*  I mean, my God, this guy's like casually like beating the shit out of him.
*  This guy is so big.
*  And I heard like people are terrified to spar with this cat.
*  Like they don't want to fucking spar with this dude.
*  You bring this guy into spar, you and he's just beating the fuck out of you.
*  And he could take an insane shot.
*  He took like a three piece.
*  Like it was nothing.
*  Like it was nothing.
*  He just moves his head a little bit, a little bit, a little bit when he's getting hit.
*  He rolls it a little bit.
*  But the really good boxers, the guys who spar, look at that uppercut, that sneaky left uppercut.
*  He keeps hitting him with.
*  Look at that one.
*  He hits him with.
*  I see it wasn't exactly in and out of distance.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Just stands right in front of you.
*  He was a parallel legs so he could hit with both arms.
*  He's much bigger, right?
*  He's 40 pounds bigger than this dude.
*  And he's fucking dangerous as shit, man.
*  Oh my Jesus.
*  Look at that right hand, man.
*  How beautiful is it too?
*  But it's like skillful.
*  It's skillful fluid punching but from a tank.
*  He's that panzer.
*  Yeah, skillful.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And he's crazy knockout power and he's a vicious body puncher too, man.
*  I watched some of his highlights of some of his other fights tonight.
*  I went down to rabbit hole.
*  Vicious body puncher too.
*  It's terrifying.
*  He just walks towards you, just beats your ass.
*  You can't hurt him.
*  Crazy.
*  It's like remember Francis Nugano and who's that South African amazing?
*  No, he's not South African.
*  Are you thinking about Jarzino Rosenstrike?
*  Rosenstrike.
*  Yeah, he just stormed him.
*  It was literally not even a proper punch.
*  It was Francis just walked towards him like this.
*  Just winging, winging nuclear bombs and one of them caught him.
*  Boom, out cold.
*  And another one on the way down.
*  Yeah, well, that's the kind of power that Francis has.
*  It's just crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  That's why I always love combat sports so much is that there's a lot of sports like tennis
*  where a lot of money plays a big role in the sport.
*  It's a rich sport.
*  A lot of so a lot of money, a lot of business, a lot of politics centers into the sport.
*  Soccer is like that.
*  Basketball is like lots of politics.
*  But like combat sports is like a dude from like a sand mine.
*  Right.
*  Somewhere in the world.
*  Yep.
*  To start KOing people.
*  And within five.
*  I mean, Conor McGregor, a guy who's a fucking pipe, not an engineer, but he was some blue
*  collar job.
*  There's also people that if they do something first and then get into fighting, like there's
*  a lot of guys that are like powerlifters, crossfit guys, NFL players.
*  I think a big one that's going to be that we'll see is people gymnastics because especially
*  guys who do the rings and things like that.
*  Think about how much more arm dexterity and strength those guys have.
*  Imagine that guy getting your neck.
*  You know, imagine a guy like that who's a black belt in jujitsu with that kind of crazy
*  strength to be able to hold yourself up in the air like that.
*  I did maybe three, four years of gymnastics before I started.
*  Did it help you?
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  That's why that's when I started resting because wrestlers, Greco-Roman wrestlers do gymnastics.
*  They all do flips and shit.
*  So that's when I started watching them practice and I was doing gymnastics.
*  And I remember when I started jujitsu, I remember just even my get ups from positions and my
*  takes where I'm strong, the positions where I could be strong were much more different
*  than a guy who's like in the gym all the time bench pressing.
*  Right, right, right, right.
*  For sure.
*  You have much better control of your body.
*  One of the things we found out at 10th Planet with Richie and Gio Martinez was break dancers.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  That's gymnastics.
*  Totally.
*  That's gymnastics.
*  Totally.
*  When those guys started training, everybody was like, whoa.
*  And so Eddie started learning break dancing moves.
*  He's like, Eddie's the best.
*  He'll like, what do we got to do?
*  What do we got to do?
*  Show me how to break dance.
*  Because those guys can do all that crazy shit where they can spin around on one hand so
*  they can do a lotus in the air.
*  They can do a handstand.
*  Then they put their legs in the lotus position and they can stand on one hand and hop around
*  on one hand.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Bananas.
*  So that kind of control of your body and that kind of strength like directly, those guys
*  really got very, well, they also trained really hard, but they got very good at jujitsu
*  very quick.
*  Yeah.
*  My party trick used to be a backflip at a nightclub.
*  No slippery shoes for you, bro.
*  Just whip it out.
*  You can't have them slippery.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  Those ones that, when I see men wear those shoes, I'm like, do you hate traction?
*  Dude, with my...
*  When I buy jeans, when I go to stores, the clerks will always think I'm insane because
*  I'll practice checking for a bit.
*  Just check a kick.
*  You know what you need?
*  You need a pair of Origin jeans.
*  Oh, like stretchy ones?
*  The most light, stretchy.
*  Combat ready.
*  They are basically pajamas.
*  They're basically pajamas.
*  They feel like sweatpants.
*  But they look pretty though.
*  Yeah.
*  Let me show you.
*  Go to the Origin website.
*  All American made, everything, threads, everything.
*  Manufactured in America, everything, 100%.
*  Buttons, everything.
*  All made in America.
*  This is Jocko Willings company.
*  I have the shirt sometimes too when I feel just a nice shirt but it's tight.
*  I go, what if I need to pull guard?
*  They look like regular pants.
*  They look like regular...
*  Yeah, if you need to pull guard in these, dude, you could fucking train in these.
*  I could literally kick the bag in these and I'm not bullshitting.
*  I'm not bullshitting.
*  You could throw headkicks in these.
*  They're like pajamas.
*  But they look like jeans.
*  $129.
*  That's $110 outside of my budget.
*  I'll get you a pair.
*  Just text me what your size is and I'll get you a pair.
*  They're the shit.
*  There's a bunch of different companies that sell stuff like that.
*  I really like barbell jeans.
*  They do that.
*  They sell those.
*  Oh, I've heard of those.
*  I've heard of those.
*  RevTown are my favorite.
*  RevTown have like the best cut.
*  Those are the ones I wore in the special.
*  Those are RevTown jeans.
*  I went to the special.
*  They're super stretchy.
*  They're like, you can stretch out in them.
*  But by far the most comfortable are the Origin ones.
*  The Origins, they nailed it.
*  Because it's the most loose.
*  The other ones are like really free moving, but they're pants.
*  Chuck Norris Action Jeans.
*  Look at that picture.
*  $20, that's my budget.
*  When I talked about that in my special, people were like, what?
*  Chuck Norris Action Jeans.
*  They were real thing.
*  They had a gusset in the crotch.
*  Look at those slippery shoes.
*  Yeah, he's got the slippery shoes.
*  Chuck didn't give a fuck about traction.
*  Chuck wasn't worried about you.
*  He was trying to pivot on you, son.
*  I used to work as a bouncer in a club where there was an outfit for the security too.
*  And dress shoes, dress pants, red, suspenders, and like a fully, what's the tuxedo shirt?
*  Like a collar shirt.
*  Stiff.
*  Not good.
*  And I remember the whole time being like, I'm going to rip these pants as soon as I
*  even do anything.
*  Not only that, but someone with a collar on.
*  If you have a collar.
*  If you have a shirt with a collar, that is a weapon against you that's on your neck.
*  Like, why do you have that?
*  That seems so crazy.
*  If you're in a position where you think you might have to defend yourself, you should
*  be wearing something that tears away from your body fairly easily around the upper body
*  and the lower body, it better give you some movement.
*  You can't have any time, and you better have some goddamn traction on the bottom of your
*  soles.
*  You can't have some slippery ass.
*  See, that was slippery this year.
*  And the floor is a nightclub floor.
*  Those are all fucking slippery doodle.
*  All polished, slippery, and beer and shit spilled everywhere.
*  Every fight I would see would literally be the first guy throwing the bunch, and they're
*  all on the ground.
*  And then people are kicking you in the head with boots on.
*  Yeah, fuck that.
*  Fuck that.
*  Fuck that.
*  Yeah, fuck getting in fights.
*  You know, that's the other thing.
*  People always say, if I could fight, I'd fucking be fucking everybody up.
*  Like, no you wouldn't, you'd be dead.
*  I punched one person in my lifetime working there.
*  Just one person.
*  Most of the time I would grab them, try to get them in a hole, they would calm down.
*  And one time, this was this big fucking guy, and he opened with a front kick.
*  Oh no.
*  A well, hip over.
*  Fat dude, like 40 years old, but a good...
*  But he threw a legit front kick.
*  Yeah, and immediately I knew I'm not gonna just grab him.
*  That's a crazy thing to open with.
*  Yeah, I get a hold of that and I throw an overhand immediately.
*  Break my thumb.
*  To this day, look at my thumb.
*  Oh no.
*  Immediately.
*  And I feel all my hand shatter.
*  It's done.
*  Did the guy get hurt?
*  No.
*  Not a dent.
*  Not a dent.
*  You know how he left the nightclub?
*  He dragged his wife by her hair.
*  Jesus.
*  Like a...
*  And left the club into the night.
*  Maybe that's what she likes.
*  She likes to go to bars, fuck a bunch of people up, and then drag her away, like, let's go
*  baby.
*  And she just rides him.
*  And then we went to court.
*  Oh my God.
*  Did he get sued or did you sue them?
*  I think it was the nightclub suing him.
*  Not suing, but whatever settlement.
*  I mean, it's still...
*  People got hurt, so it's still some sort of an investigation or something.
*  But I had to testify in court.
*  And he had to do a formal apology.
*  They do that here too, right?
*  Where you have to stand up in court and do a formal...
*  And he had to...
*  Me and the other bartenders working there, I was the only security working that night,
*  of course.
*  Classic nightclub, 200 people only guy, 19 year old kid, cool.
*  Yeah, great.
*  With a bartender who's gay.
*  Awesome.
*  So, we had to be...
*  And he had to apologize.
*  He goes, gentlemen, I'm sorry.
*  And you know how he showed up to court?
*  He was just all swollen up, not from that fight.
*  This was months later.
*  So he's just living that lifestyle.
*  This is out there wrong.
*  Yeah, he was just showed up in court and was like, I'm sorry, gentlemen.
*  And just goes into the day.
*  Maybe the cops beat his ass.
*  Maybe, but he just came to court.
*  I remember all of us being like, Jesus Christ, this Mongoloid.
*  Some dudes like to fight.
*  That's a very unfortunate thing that you enjoy.
*  See, that was another thing that when I went to all these self-defense classes, I used
*  to go to Wong Wing Chun, you know.
*  And there would be a master who said, you know, sparring is not real life combat.
*  In real life combat, I hurt you.
*  I kill you.
*  And I'm like, interesting.
*  But I would already go to Jiu-Jitsu and I'd be in my head like, you know this instructor
*  shows up.
*  He's got a belly button that has hair in it and it's a little floppy.
*  And I'm like, I reckon if I'm low kick you, you're going to feel something.
*  And that was a big problem, you know, with self-defense courses.
*  And me and Preet, the Jiu-Jitsu guy, we actually used to go to a couple of youth camps where
*  there was troublesome youth, you know, who get into fights.
*  And we would do demonstrations where, do you know, in the 90s in Eastern Europe, there was
*  a rise in people getting stabbed because people would think that you take this course
*  on, you know, you take a course every Sunday where they teach you, somebody had to actually
*  be done, hey, ha!
*  I remember my friend telling me like, if you attack me with a knife, you're more dangerous
*  to yourself than you are to me because he believed in the system.
*  And then all these retards would be in fucking Latvia or something.
*  And you're with your girl and some crackhead comes up at you and you're scarved up.
*  Here you go, baby.
*  Suck!
*  And you see your fucking blood on your hands.
*  And in that, and that's always what I learned from immediately.
*  I was like, from those street, from working as a bouncer is that, yeah, I'm comfortable
*  in a sparring environment, mouth guard on and we're friends.
*  Even though you're trying to take my head off, I'm in a comfortable environment where
*  I know if I go out, it's over.
*  You know, if I get hurt, if you hurt me with a middle kick.
*  You're not going to get beat in the mouth.
*  But there's men out there who go to bars, they get gacked up and they just brawl.
*  Those are men who are comfortable in the chaos of a bar.
*  You know?
*  Also, probably not making good decisions at any stage of their life.
*  See, that's what I'm saying is that even though I might be a Jiu Jitsu guy, this guy's going
*  to bite my ear.
*  He's going to, you know.
*  You don't want to fight people, period.
*  So that's when I really put together all those self-defense.
*  Me and Preet would go to youth camps and he would like, he would like, he would like
*  a crankle up a plastic bottle and he would be like, okay, Ari, do all the cool moves
*  that they all teach, you know, like hi, behind the back, grab the knife, you know?
*  And then he would just, you know, I would like grab his wrist and then he would just
*  pull the knife away and he's like, at that point you have a deep cut in your arm.
*  You'd be fucked.
*  And he would look at those kids and go, so you guys think that if you see your white
*  flesh like a rose open up in your palm, you think you're going to look at that and go,
*  okay, fucking get the pose.
*  No, that's a instant panic attack survival instinct, you know?
*  I don't want to see if it's really bad.
*  Is that a knife fight?
*  I'm a very, no, no, it's almost describing exactly what you're saying.
*  Like these guys, this guy gets his leg cut really bad.
*  Oh, I did see that.
*  Don't show it to me.
*  Don't show it to me.
*  It's horrible.
*  It's horrible.
*  It's horrible.
*  He slices his thigh open almost to the bone, like where it opens up like a flap.
*  Dude, I gotta pee so bad.
*  Let's be right back.
*  We'll be right back.
*  And we're back.
*  Doesn't it feel so good?
*  There's a feeling that when you have to pee that like you have like 30% of your mind is
*  available.
*  70% is like, don't piss your pants.
*  And you're talking about wrist locks.
*  I'm like, right?
*  Gotta get it.
*  I can't take it.
*  I had to pee too, but I was just like, I'm going to piss my pants.
*  We did it.
*  We held it together.
*  We held it together.
*  Hey, thank you for being there Saturday night.
*  It was a lot of fun.
*  And Friday night too.
*  By the way, I have to say, dude, watching you do that live special is amazing to just
*  watch you.
*  Dude, me and Ron White were in the green room when you were on stage and we were like, thank
*  God.
*  We're just chilling.
*  You know, in common.
*  Because it's scary.
*  It's scary.
*  Yeah.
*  But then again, and here's another point that I have to say that.
*  Do you know how crazy it is that you have, okay, one of the biggest podcasts in the world,
*  but you're an actual practitioner of an art form that only, only 10 years ago was not
*  even standup comedy wasn't even the main form of comedy.
*  There was sketch comedy, improv, movies.
*  Standup was a subsidiary art form of comedy, like a small genre.
*  And that you with now your platform and your voice are a practitioner.
*  You could, this is how lucky we as comedians are to have a guy who's an actual practicing
*  comedian.
*  You could also be like a famous guy and just live in the shadows, show up at a club every
*  two months, be a superstar to a, cause you're talented and funny enough to a, to a good
*  set.
*  You know, people go home.
*  That was great.
*  Because he saw, because people come out to see you, they'll, they'll have a good experience.
*  But you're a guy, you're writing bits.
*  You're like coming to the club, your own club.
*  Of course you're coming to the club and you're writing, you're working on it.
*  You're fixing it.
*  And how lucky we are to have a guy who's an actual, you could be like a piece of shit
*  asshole.
*  You could absolutely.
*  Yeah, but it wouldn't work.
*  We would never have been able to do what we're doing.
*  And what we're doing is really good for me too.
*  It's one of the reasons why, like I think we're all benefiting greatly from that place.
*  We're all benefiting from the vibe of it.
*  Nobody's benefited more than me.
*  Me?
*  I've benefited more than you.
*  Yeah, we're both benefiting.
*  It's all good, dude.
*  It's all for everybody.
*  It's all, we're all getting something out of it and it's, we're all getting something
*  in it together too.
*  That's the cool part about it.
*  We're all like, you know, Asan always says that that's one of the things that door guys
*  say when one of them gets a gig, they say we up.
*  Dude, they're so supportive.
*  Because I also did, I auditioned for Adam.
*  I auditioned for Adam.
*  I got into the club the, the like proper way.
*  I wasn't some fucking male guy.
*  Nobody knew who you were.
*  Yeah.
*  And whenever I get some opportunity like this right now, they're all like so cheering for
*  me, you know?
*  It's very supportive because they also know that that this, all the stuff that's happening
*  to you can happen to them.
*  All the stuff that's happening right now to William Montgomery could happen to you.
*  All the stuff that's happening to David Lucas and Cam Patterson and all these guys, these
*  Hans Kim, Hans Kim selling out weekends everywhere.
*  He's killing it and he's doing great.
*  His act is tight.
*  He's got some funny shit, man.
*  He's got some funny shit he works at.
*  That kid has spreadsheets and shit.
*  He's going over his material on fucking Google docs.
*  Also dude, every fucking week there's another guy in that club that I'm like, who's this?
*  And then I'm like, dude, Tyler Fisher.
*  Yep.
*  That's funny.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Bro, that bit he does about being a cop for the pedos.
*  Bro, how funny is that?
*  How funny is that bit?
*  I showed it to the door guys.
*  I filmed myself behind the curtain at Fatman having to follow Tyler.
*  I filmed my own face and the applause that he's getting and me being like this.
*  And I always riff with Tyler.
*  I go, hey Tyler, how about we keep five characters today?
*  He has a full, because he has characters, impressions.
*  He goes to the crowd.
*  He jumps, he uses the stage, liners, jokes, anecdotes, callbacks.
*  Everything is tight.
*  Yeah, it's tight and he's got so much energy, enthusiasm and that guy was having a hard
*  time.
*  He was telling the podcast that he got dropped by his agent because they couldn't handle
*  any more white straight men.
*  Like, you don't think, are you in the talent business?
*  You don't see how talented that fucking guy is?
*  But you know, it's like this weird thing that we're all a part of.
*  Well, I was just, I mean, think of my storyline.
*  On the 8th of December, I'm in London, the UK.
*  I went to London a couple of years ago, had a great time because I was doing the open
*  mic circuit.
*  But this time I went back as a headliner wanting to maybe move up in the industry.
*  Two months, nothing's happening, struggling.
*  Just because I went to New York, same thing.
*  Just because I didn't really have a connection, nobody really knew me.
*  And I'm also not a guy who's great at showing up at the park.
*  I don't do coke.
*  I hang, but I only talk bits.
*  And I would go to, let's say, a New York, like a comedy cellar, and there's like 20
*  guys with backpacks and tripods all waiting to talk to the manager.
*  And when I see that, I always feel like, I don't want to be another asshole.
*  You know, hello, it's my, I'm the guy, you know?
*  So I just felt like on every audition I had, when you audition in London, that's also a
*  good shout out to Adam Eaglet.
*  Do you know how crazy that is that he watches Sunday, Monday?
*  He watches everybody.
*  You can be on the street, a guy, and you get to be in front of the probably the most important
*  talent scout.
*  And he watches them, and he gives you, and if you do a good job, he'll give you a spot.
*  He's really good at it.
*  He's really good at it.
*  He really understands comedy.
*  He understands comedy.
*  He gets it.
*  He sees voices.
*  He wants, he gives everybody a shot.
*  He loves to...
*  And he was on a show with Norm MacDonald.
*  They were co-hosts.
*  Insane.
*  His best friend.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, Adam's awesome.
*  And he was one of the first resource, he was the first guy that I got when I was deciding
*  to do this.
*  He was number one.
*  So I remember when Sam, like...
*  And then, yeah, so 8th of December, I fly over to Austin on 9th of December.
*  Nothing's going on.
*  Sam's talent is in town, just by accident in Austin.
*  And he came to Estonia to visit me.
*  We only talked online before that.
*  And he goes, yeah, sure, I'll get you a spot.
*  But I didn't want to bother him, so I'm still signing up outside.
*  And then Sam goes, where are you?
*  Adam's looking for you.
*  And I go, oh shit.
*  I go to the security.
*  You know, the Avengers are out there.
*  I gotta be like, hey guys.
*  I go like, hey guys.
*  And they're all here with my accent.
*  They're like, what the fuck?
*  Yeah, you gotta get somebody.
*  Sam comes out.
*  I do my set.
*  And even before my set, I see Adam Eaget.
*  And I'm like, oh, that's the Adam Eaget.
*  Because I read about him in...
*  No, Brody Stevens, in his special, always says Adam Eaget like seven times.
*  So I remember that name.
*  Adam Eaget.
*  Adam Eaget trying to hold me down.
*  This is my shot!
*  And he's back there.
*  And I'm like, oh shit, he actually...
*  Dude, I'm 12 years into this.
*  And to see a talent manager or a scout or whatever to actually watch your set is actually
*  rare.
*  Well, the story with me and Adam is, Adam was...
*  He used to work at the Tempe Improv.
*  And that's where I met him.
*  And he was always a great guy.
*  And then he came over to LA and started working at the Comedy Store when I had left.
*  Because I had left after the Carlos Mencia thing.
*  I was gone for seven years.
*  So I was doing the Improv, I was doing the Ice House, I was doing other clubs.
*  And so then he came and met me.
*  I think it was like 2014.
*  Or yeah, 2014.
*  So seven years after 2007 now.
*  And I was like, come on, I'm the talent coordinator now.
*  They got rid of the other guy.
*  And I was like, oh, I don't know, man.
*  I don't know if I want to go back.
*  It's just like, I just felt so fucked over.
*  The whole thing was so gross.
*  It was like, fuck that place.
*  But then Ari was doing a special there.
*  So I knew I had to be there.
*  So I had to go back.
*  So I went back Monday night before Ari or whatever night Roast Battle was at.
*  And I sat in the audience at Roast Battle.
*  It was insane.
*  It was insane.
*  Jeff Ross said this is like my first time at the club in seven years.
*  Like it was, that was a cool feeling.
*  Like to be like, I felt comfortable there again.
*  And then I watched Ari.
*  I have to be there for Ari.
*  I mean, this is not just Ari's first big special on Comedy Central, but it's also Ari, my friend
*  who I knew who was a doorman.
*  OK, when I was on, I guess I was on either news radio or Fear Factor.
*  I don't know what TV show I was on at the time I met Ari.
*  It might have been Fear Factor.
*  But like all of a sudden I'm hanging out with this kid, this young kid just starting out.
*  And then we become friends and he goes on the road with me and we work together.
*  We do podcasts together.
*  And then all of a sudden, all these years later, he's got his own fucking Comedy Central
*  special and he's got his own Comedy Central TV show, which is one of the reasons why they
*  gave him a special and he's filming it in the fucking OR.
*  I'm like, I have to be there.
*  I had to be there.
*  So then I came back.
*  And so I was there all the time.
*  Then I just started going like every day.
*  I was there all the time.
*  Well, yeah, we heard about it on the podcast all the time.
*  I just went back full on.
*  And then Adam and I started talking.
*  And one of the things we started talking, I was like, what do you want?
*  Do you want to do?
*  He felt a little bit underpaid.
*  And I go, what do you want to do?
*  Like what would be the ideal way to open up a club?
*  We would start talking about what to do.
*  We start talking about what is really important.
*  What's really important is like a talent coordinator is a lot of times it's just the manager picking
*  headliners to come in for the weekend.
*  Or some insane girlfriend of the owner.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is the difference.
*  The difference is I think in I think there's probably different kinds of classifications
*  for what kind of clubs they are.
*  Our club is a development club.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's not just a club for great headliners like when Colin Quinn is here or Dice is here.
*  It's a club for developing.
*  So we said, OK, how many nights a week should we have open mic night?
*  And we said two.
*  Let's do Sunday and Monday.
*  So two nights, full open mic night.
*  And then it was Adam's idea to have door people audition with their act.
*  And I was like, you know what?
*  Door guys fucked off so much at the Comedy Store.
*  They were so bad at doing certain things.
*  They were scamming money and getting people to bribe them, which we've had.
*  We've had that too.
*  But that's normal.
*  Right.
*  You know, you got to.
*  These are comedians, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Wild people.
*  But the door people at the mothership are so much better than any of the door people
*  at the Comedy Store.
*  And I think part of it is because there is this ethic there that we're all the same thing.
*  We're all together.
*  We're all the same.
*  We all hang out together at Mincey's Bar.
*  We're all the exact same thing.
*  Just some of us been doing it 30 years.
*  Some of us been doing it 12 years.
*  Some of us doing it five years.
*  Some of us moved here because they did a few open mic nights.
*  It's the only thing they ever loved in their life.
*  It's the only thing they ever wanted to do in their life.
*  And they're like, God damn it, I want to be in Austin.
*  And then they moved there and they got a job there.
*  And their act is what gets them the job.
*  And if you could string together a few minutes and you could show that you could get those
*  sparks going and make a little campfire.
*  OK, let's see how much better you get at making campfires.
*  Let's see.
*  Let's see what you can do.
*  And that's the difference between that club and everywhere else.
*  And it all goes all the way up to the very top, whether it's Shane or Tony or anybody
*  who's working on their act and work on new stuff.
*  You see them.
*  You see Brian Simpson constantly.
*  Ron White, sharper than he's ever been.
*  Assassin.
*  How old is he?
*  He's 10 years old.
*  Ron White was born before there was feet.
*  People still had fins.
*  He's an animal.
*  He's better than he's ever been before.
*  Yeah.
*  We were driving to your special in San Antonio.
*  He picked me up from my house and I'm like, I'm in the car with Ron White and he's just
*  talking about DMT doing 90 miles an hour all the way sideways.
*  He's like, all right, there's another world out there.
*  I'm like, we're doing 90 in this one though.
*  Ron's in the simulation for sure.
*  But also, like I was saying about you, he also, you might think that this guy will come
*  to the club and be a superstar.
*  No, he comes in and works on his act.
*  Talks about bits.
*  Yeah.
*  We hang out.
*  Having a panic attack just like I am.
*  And he loves when a bit bombs.
*  He comes back, well, that fucking didn't work at all.
*  At all.
*  He's like, he's playing us by this bit bomb.
*  He comes to the degree where he goes, that fucking sucked.
*  Yeah, they weren't my favorite.
*  But he was, he's two things.
*  One, he's the reason why I moved here because he was the first guy.
*  He was here before the pandemic.
*  But he's from Texas.
*  Yes.
*  So he moved here.
*  I was like, where he been?
*  Because I knew he still had his house in Beverly Hills.
*  I'm going to get rid of my house in Beverly Hills.
*  I'm going to live down here in Texas.
*  And so he said it was center of the country.
*  You could travel anywhere.
*  And I was like, damn, maybe.
*  But I'm like, I can't live there.
*  Because I was always wanting to get the fuck out of LA, but I can't leave the store.
*  But once they shut the store down, I was like, oh, all right.
*  What the fuck am I here for?
*  The crime?
*  Like, what am I here for?
*  If I'm not here for the store.
*  And you're not doing movies.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't want my youngest kids to grow up in this place.
*  It seems like it's getting worse.
*  I also felt like there's better places to be.
*  And so when we all came out here together, it's like we all, especially like when we
*  first started talking about the developing of the club, it was the whole idea was like,
*  let's do it our way.
*  Let's do it the right way.
*  As opposed to doing it as a business, let's do it as like, what are you trying to do?
*  You're just trying to make the best club possible.
*  OK, well then do that.
*  And then the business stuff, put that aside.
*  You got to stop.
*  Don't think about maximizing profits because there's only one shareholder.
*  So let's just do it the right way.
*  And the right way is the comedians get most of the money.
*  The right way is you bring the best people in.
*  The right way is you develop talent.
*  The right way is you have a show like Killtoning that sets the tone for the entire comedy universe.
*  It sets the tone.
*  And then guys like you can get on that stage, crack some fucking great bits.
*  And then bam, it's crazy.
*  You're off to the races.
*  And I kind of feel like because I'm a big book guy, I've read everything about the comedy
*  story, everything about the history of the industry, Late Night Wars, David Letterman
*  moving Johnny Carson moving from New York to the Burbank.
*  I know everything.
*  I kind of feel like I'm living the gold rush that was in the 80s and 90s in comedy store.
*  I kind of feel like I'm living that right now.
*  This one's crazier.
*  Well, yeah.
*  This one's crazier because this one people are doing arenas.
*  We're doing Killtoning this weekend in Madison Square Garden.
*  There's two nights, two nights in New York City.
*  Sold out Madison Square Garden.
*  This is Tony's and Red Band's coming out party.
*  This is the big deal.
*  This is the big deal.
*  They sold this out quick.
*  Quick.
*  And it's a beautiful thing to see.
*  It's a beautiful thing to see everybody flourishing.
*  And this idea that we had actually work.
*  It's actually coming to fruition.
*  Amazing.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And to have you guys, to have you, Tony and Ron there when I was filming that thing also.
*  So the green room was just like regular green room.
*  Regular ass green room.
*  Right.
*  So we're used to hanging out and having fun and laughing, being fun and just like being
*  silly together.
*  So we're all being silly.
*  So I was just super loose.
*  But then also there was that moment where me and you were in your green room and both
*  of us were in our notebooks for about 20 minutes just in silence.
*  And I remember after thinking like, holy shit, see this is what it's all about.
*  Yeah.
*  We're just writing bits and just.
*  You got to work at it, man.
*  And sometimes we don't, you know, sometimes we don't.
*  And one of the things that really made me think a lot about this, the live thing, it's
*  like, first of all, I said no.
*  And my manager called me and said, do you want to do a live special?
*  I said, fuck that.
*  I don't do that.
*  And then I was, as I got off the phone with her, I was driving and I was like, why did
*  I say no?
*  Like why such a pussy?
*  Oh, because you're scared.
*  You're scared of doing it live.
*  And I was like, oh, why are you scared of doing it live?
*  Like what is it about?
*  Like you do everything live.
*  Like you do UFC live.
*  Podcasts are essentially, you know, they're recorded, but you just, you're just freewheeling,
*  right?
*  So why can't you do that live?
*  Like just prepare better.
*  Just prepare more.
*  So I was preparing way more.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Watching you develop that hour was insane.
*  You were working.
*  Dude, also I've never seen you off.
*  I've seen you in the green room, maybe in a different mood than the other night.
*  Dude, when you go on stage, it's the rock city every fucking night.
*  It's crazy to watch.
*  Well, I just been preparing this set for quite a while.
*  You know, I thought I was going to do a special in August of 2020.
*  That was the plan because I had done a 2018.
*  So I did 2016 was triggered and then my next Netflix special was 2018.
*  That was strange times and I was going to do one in 2020 and call it sacred clown.
*  And it was based on the Lakota Hioka was the person in the tribe that made fun of everything
*  because we couldn't make fun of anything.
*  It was bullshit.
*  They had like a spiritual person in their tribe.
*  Their goal was to make fun of everything.
*  It was a sacred clown.
*  And so I was like, that's perfect because that's what it is.
*  You're just talking shit and making fun of things and you should be able to do that about
*  everything and everything you can't make fun of is most likely bullshit.
*  Well, that's your comedy club, dude.
*  I love that you called your comedy rooms after the two nuclear bombs.
*  But that already shows there's no rules.
*  There's no rules.
*  It's over.
*  And I was worried about that at first.
*  I was like, God, this is so disrespectful.
*  But that's perfect.
*  That's letting you know there are no rules.
*  You know, one of the reasons why I decided to definitely call it that?
*  Why?
*  Because I told it to Louis C.K.
*  Anyway, I go, that's it.
*  It has to be that.
*  And also, it's part of UFO folklore.
*  One of the main reasons why I wanted to have them, because I knew I had two rooms and I
*  knew there was two bombs.
*  And it was after those two nuclear bombs were dropped that they started Kenneth Arnold had
*  his sightings.
*  Roswell, New Mexico had that big sighting.
*  Like all the big events of UFO folklore happened after the bomb.
*  And the idea is that these interdimensional beings, they go, okay, these fucking crazy
*  territorial apes have now developed nuclear bombs.
*  This could be very dangerous because if these idiots arm themselves as we have right now,
*  to the point where they can blow up the whole world like many, many times over, they might
*  do it.
*  Let's like, let's make sure everything's cool.
*  And so that's when all the UFOs started.
*  So for the comedy mothership, where this UFO based thing, we kind of had to have those
*  as the name because that's what sends out the signal.
*  Those bombs, Fat Man and Little Boy, those bombs, that's what, if you believe, and I
*  love to believe, I don't 100% believe, but I kind of love to believe, I love to at least
*  talk about it.
*  If you believe that we were visited multiple times by alien life, a lot of it happened
*  after 1947, makes sense.
*  Well, if the universe is infinite and there's a higher species out there, you would look
*  at Earth and you'd be interested.
*  100%.
*  And then who knows what happened in Roswell, so the bombs were 45, Roswell was 47.
*  Who knows what really happened at Roswell, but they do know that whatever they did, they
*  took that wreckage and they flew it in two separate jets to Wright-Patterson Air Force
*  Base because they didn't, if one of the jets went down, they wanted to make sure they still
*  had the wreckage.
*  They put it in two different jets.
*  That's how important this shit was, whatever the fuck it was.
*  Who's that guy, Bob?
*  Bob?
*  Bob Bazaar.
*  Who had that crazy story?
*  I just remember one story where he told that there were like multiple doors open and for
*  it was an act because they were separate or something where he was working on it and by
*  accident he saw the spaceship through the doors and I remember being like, holy shit.
*  Well he saw, when he went in to see it for the first time, it had an American flag sticker
*  on it and his first inclination was, oh, this is why people keep seeing these things, these
*  are ours.
*  But then the way it's described, now who knows if it's true, but I love to believe it is,
*  The way he describes it is like they essentially brought him in and said, tell me what this
*  is.
*  Figure this out.
*  How does this work?
*  And they really never did.
*  They kind of got a working understanding of it, but based on some element that was only
*  theoretical at the time, now been proven by one of the particle colliders.
*  They created this particle.
*  Hydro particle collider, right?
*  Well, yeah.
*  The one in Switzerland?
*  Yeah, that's where it is, right?
*  That's the one that they were...
*  Creating black holes, huh?
*  Yeah, that's what they were worried about.
*  Cool, bro.
*  I remember I did like mushrooms for the first time and I started reading about it and I'm
*  like, great.
*  I fucking...
*  Those super nerds are going to kill us all.
*  But they did discover that this element that Bob Lazar theorized exists.
*  But then what I've heard is like they already knew that that was going to be an element.
*  So him saying that there's a lot of things like the Higgs boson, there's a lot of things
*  that they knew existed, but they needed to get proof of it through the particle colliders.
*  And so a lot of people aren't that impressed with that, but he said they had a stable isotope.
*  They had a stable version of this element and this is what powered this generator.
*  And this stable version of this element would sit inside of this container and it would
*  be bombarded with radiation and it would somehow or another manipulate gravity.
*  It's the wildest story ever, the most fun story ever.
*  He essentially said they were trying for years to try to figure out how to reproduce it.
*  They couldn't figure out how it worked.
*  They did a bunch of different things.
*  One guy died apparently trying to cut into it.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah, that was a guy before him apparently.
*  And then there was the wackiest thing of all that we talked about this yesterday.
*  They said that they had a big thing on religion and one of the things that they said that
*  they look at us as containers.
*  That religion was here so that we don't damage what's inside the container.
*  The religion was put here to give people rules and regulations so they don't destroy their
*  souls.
*  So they're just harvesting our souls and making sure our souls don't go rotten.
*  Because we would be just sucking and fucking and sucking.
*  Right, no, imagine that.
*  If that's what happens, that's how they trick you into downloading your brain into a computer.
*  That's it.
*  That's the end result.
*  They're just trying to get that soul.
*  And then you are just trapped and that's what hell really is.
*  You're stuck on a hard drive with nothing there.
*  Imagine living your whole life being paralyzed but you don't eat food or water but you're
*  lying on the floor of an empty office building.
*  That's you inside a computer forever.
*  In the void.
*  And they don't download anybody else onto your hard drive either.
*  Because if they have other people on that hard drive it will ruin the hard drive.
*  We can't have your code and my code mixing together.
*  Come on.
*  Yeah, we're in a weird time my brother.
*  We're in a weird time because the reason why comedy, as you were saying earlier, is like
*  this kind of comedy is like the most prevalent comedy.
*  Because the only one you could actually be free and do.
*  You can't make Tropic Thunder anymore.
*  You can't make, you know, there's a lot.
*  There'll be a movie.
*  It's a pendulum, you know.
*  Culture is always a pendulum.
*  There'll be some dude.
*  There'll be the new Andrew Dice Clay.
*  There'll be the new Tropic Thunder.
*  There'll be the new Superbad.
*  I hope so.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  I hope so.
*  As soon as something is like 51% of popular opinion, the 49% becomes cool.
*  The rebellion becomes cool.
*  Yeah, but it won't even be popular opinion.
*  The popular opinion is almost 100% that they would want Tropic Thunder.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You know, the real popular opinion amongst people who go to see those films.
*  Let me say it that way.
*  Because popular opinion amongst people who don't go see Superbad, what difference does
*  it make?
*  The people that do go see those movies and do enjoy those movies would go to see one
*  right now.
*  Most of them.
*  But there's always, but yeah, and that's why I always, there's so much fun in rebellion
*  and breaking the rules.
*  And the more, I always think the stronger a line is, the more power you have of crossing
*  it, you know.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Also, I just don't think the line is real.
*  I think the line is a small, very vocal minority of people.
*  And the majority of people know what jokes are.
*  Yeah.
*  But they can't finance these things anymore.
*  But then again, if it's all no rules and no like, if you don't get the reaction, then
*  it doesn't have any power, you know.
*  It's like when Tony, we were just talking in the green room, when Tony Hinchcliffe said
*  faggot on Netflix at the Tom Brady roast.
*  That's like, if you're a culture nerd, that's like a cultural moment.
*  Right.
*  Because-
*  We call him a Confederate fag.
*  Yeah.
*  He's saying something that unanimously five years ago was the line.
*  Yeah.
*  But now-
*  The line's moved.
*  It hasn't even moved, but people dance around the line and it gives it power.
*  Because if you create a line, you're going to create people who are going to dance around
*  it, give them-
*  Yeah, but no, they don't, we didn't agree to the line.
*  That's why, but the thing is like that line only existed in corporate controlled media
*  and existed in like virtue signaling internet people.
*  But that's the power of the release.
*  Right.
*  That line didn't exist amongst friends.
*  Oh.
*  That's why.
*  Off the record talk?
*  Yeah.
*  Real shit talk, that line never existed.
*  Retard was on the table.
*  Oh, Retard has never left the table.
*  Never left the table.
*  Especially in quiet company when you're alone.
*  Yeah.
*  What's going on with your brother?
*  Dude.
*  Retarded.
*  He's fucking retarded.
*  I can't talk to him, he doesn't listen.
*  That's normal talk.
*  Normal talk.
*  We know what that means.
*  And the idea that we're supposed to back off these words because a select minority of very
*  vocal people who are like super sensitive and probably medicated, like no, no, don't
*  listen.
*  Like no, don't watch that movie.
*  No, don't go to see that stand up.
*  You don't have to like everything.
*  There's a lot I don't like that other people love.
*  And guess what?
*  I'm fine with that.
*  I like it.
*  I like the fact there's a variety of different human beings.
*  That's the best part, I think.
*  It's a fun part of being a human.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fun.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the beauty of true diversity.
*  You know, like one of the things that's great about the club is the lineup is actually very
*  diverse, but not because we wanted it to be diverse.
*  We wanted people who are really good.
*  Killers.
*  And they come in all fucking sizes and shapes.
*  They come in.
*  Warrior, cameraman.
*  Yeah.
*  Fat gay guys, small fucking porn addicts.
*  They're all over the place.
*  They're all over the place.
*  Everybody's different.
*  And that's good.
*  That's good for everybody.
*  And it's like we speak this language.
*  We're here for this art form.
*  Everything else is fine.
*  Like you just be a nice person.
*  Be nice to us.
*  We're nice to you.
*  We're nice to each other.
*  We're all going to grow from this experience.
*  We're all going to be better people because of this.
*  We're all going to be better members of a community.
*  We're creating a community.
*  Also, there are nights at the Little Boy because of the yonder banks and stuff.
*  I'll say some stuff.
*  Yeah, you get a little wild.
*  That I know is not leaving.
*  And the release you see in the people where they're laughing so hard.
*  There's like a 40 year old guy with his wife and he's like, I can't believe this European
*  fuck is saying this.
*  This is not OK.
*  But that's so fun.
*  There's a lot of people that are laughing really hard.
*  No, no, no.
*  That's why.
*  But he's also laughing because it's not OK.
*  But it is OK.
*  It is OK here.
*  But it should be OK everywhere.
*  It's OK in private company.
*  I know.
*  It's OK in private company.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  Off the record talks.
*  Off the record talks.
*  Yeah.
*  But it should be OK.
*  And this art form requires that you do that.
*  It does.
*  It doesn't require you have to do it.
*  There's guys like, you know, Brian Regan, who are brilliant.
*  Jim Gaffigan, brilliant.
*  Gaffigan's brilliant.
*  You never have to worry about him offending you.
*  Unless you read his Twitter.
*  You never have to worry about him offending you.
*  Right?
*  His stuff is sweet to clean.
*  Nate Parkatze.
*  Perfect example.
*  Nate's genius.
*  Genius, brilliant.
*  Brilliant.
*  You can talk about table.
*  Squeaky clean.
*  Yeah.
*  Those guys have always existed and those guys are us too.
*  It's fine.
*  It's like no one dislikes Sebastian.
*  You know, everyone loves Sebastian.
*  He was just at the club last night.
*  Yeah, I brought him up.
*  Amazing.
*  He's the best.
*  The nicest guy too.
*  I love him to death.
*  Talks about his mole infestation.
*  And how he likes to cook.
*  This is how I cook a steak.
*  You ever get a guy?
*  He's awesome.
*  I actually just got a message from one of my friends.
*  They saw him at the club last night.
*  He was brilliant.
*  But the point is everybody's different.
*  That's great.
*  That's great.
*  Boy, girl, gay, straight.
*  Everybody.
*  There's a bunch.
*  All you have to do is be good.
*  That's it.
*  And you don't get any brownie points for your group if you're not good.
*  Okay?
*  If you want to come on just because you're this or that, guess what?
*  There's no room for that.
*  You have to be good.
*  All the festivals.
*  Comedy festival.
*  It was a big festival because that was where you could get up back in the day.
*  Australia, Edinburgh, JFL.
*  They're all falling apart because they didn't listen to the ripples of laughter.
*  Well, they're doing a different thing.
*  Here's the problem.
*  The people that are doing the festival themselves are not usually like working stand-up comedians.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  So they're people that exist in the ecosystem that aren't creating the thing.
*  Right?
*  So they know what they like.
*  They might know what they think.
*  And they might also apply their own personal politics to their decisions about what kind
*  of comedy they want to see.
*  It's also, is it their personal politics or is it the politics that they think people
*  are going to gravitate to?
*  You know?
*  I think it's both because I think primarily in show business people are indoctrinated
*  into the cult of leftism.
*  It's almost universal in show business except for a lot of musicians that kind of keep it
*  undercover.
*  But a lot of actors have to keep it undercover too.
*  Conservative actors just keep their mouth shut.
*  Like Chris Pratt type dudes.
*  They get in trouble every time they talk about Jesus.
*  John Cena talking in China.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Well that was different.
*  That was a little bit of an apology.
*  I didn't do that bit in my act.
*  But the whole thing about it is that you've got to let people express themselves however
*  they are.
*  However, what are you?
*  Tyler Fisher is very different than David Lucas.
*  Right?
*  David Lucas is very different than Ron White.
*  Everyone has to be able to express themselves in whatever form they find themselves in going
*  through this life in the best possible way they can.
*  That's what we're setting out to do.
*  But that's like that jazz thing that I was talking about is the resonation of the feelings
*  of the story that you're expressing that people gravitate to.
*  And when you start putting a bullshit agenda out there, I feel it.
*  I see it.
*  100%.
*  I see it.
*  And that the anti-bullshit is that green room because the green room is so fun that you
*  go on stage from there with those good vibes.
*  Like I oftentimes I'm like sad that I have to shut my phone off.
*  You know?
*  I gotta go guys.
*  And I'm sad that I have to leave our fun clubhouse.
*  Sometimes I'm sad that I have to go on stage.
*  I know.
*  I'm sad I have to go on stage.
*  I'm not really.
*  But I want to continue the conversation.
*  I know I'm going to have a great time on stage.
*  I'm looking forward to it.
*  But I want to continue the conversation.
*  And then having you guys in the green room with me when I filmed the special was huge,
*  man.
*  It was huge.
*  Because it really was like I always feel this like I went camping with Brian Callan once.
*  We went to we went on a deer hunt and I was like this is going to be crazy.
*  We're going to go to Montana.
*  It's going to be freezing.
*  It's going to be five degrees outside.
*  We're going to be sleeping on the frozen ground.
*  We're going to go hunt some mule deer in the mountains.
*  You want to do it?
*  He's like fuck yeah.
*  So we did it.
*  But I was like if you and I are together it'll be fun no matter where we are.
*  Like Brian and I could be hanging out in some shitty motel in the middle of Saskatchewan
*  just laughing our asses off.
*  Just ahh!
*  Because we're friends.
*  And we've been friends forever.
*  And so we can have fun together.
*  So no matter how chaotic the situation is when you have friends with you it changes what
*  the situation is.
*  So even though that was a live show in front of who knows how many fucking people watching
*  live on Netflix I was hanging out with you guys.
*  It was normal.
*  Normal show.
*  So I just kept myself in normal show mind and just went on stage.
*  It was very cool to learn like watch you from the side and be like yeah you're just doing
*  another set.
*  And also you were so well prepared that you were like the perfect guy to do that live
*  special you know.
*  You got to prepare in a different way.
*  It's like there's a thing about archery.
*  Ok.
*  Like if you say if you're proficient at 50 yards you can hit a bullseye on a regular
*  basis at 50 yards.
*  You really should be hunting at about 25 yards.
*  Because at 25 yards you're shaking.
*  You got adrenaline.
*  There's anxiety.
*  Maybe this is a new thing.
*  You know there's a wild hog moving 50 yards away from you and you're drawing on it like
*  Oh my God is this really happening.
*  Like you probably shouldn't be shooting at 50 yards.
*  If you want to shoot at 50 yards you should be really proficient at 100 yards and you
*  should have a bunch of shots already under your belt so you are accustomed to this experience.
*  So with comedy I was like ok I know I've done a bunch of live shows but I can't just go
*  up on stage like this is a regular live show.
*  Like I've done a bunch of shows in front of a live audience.
*  This is going to be a way different pressure and if I don't agree to that in my mind and
*  if I don't address that in my mind and over prepare you let that tiny window of doubt
*  open.
*  And that little demon of doubt will sneak in and steal your confidence and fuck with
*  your head and give you anxiety and make you start thinking about what if you bomb.
*  What if you forget the jokes.
*  What if you forget what place you're at.
*  What if you forget the line.
*  What if you forget the punchline.
*  What about that new punchline you're going to do.
*  You could mind fuck yourself.
*  Or you could just super over prepare.
*  So I super over prepared.
*  I listened to recordings.
*  I watched videos.
*  I wrote for like I prepared for like five hours the day of the show.
*  I never left my computer.
*  That's how I always feel about writing and writing during the day about comedies.
*  People always go like oh you just write an act and I go to be honest 99% of the shit
*  I write during the day doesn't end up actually working on stage.
*  Those bits still click on stage.
*  But I can't I have to give an energy out to the universe that listen I'm preparing for
*  this.
*  Yeah.
*  Just so I know that I'm ready you know when I go on stage and even though you can't exactly
*  say that I'm writing the perfect set and it's going to go as I wrote it.
*  But the energy that I put out in the universe is that I'm preparing.
*  Yeah it's also it's not that's not the process.
*  The process is you write it exactly as you're going to say it because you really need to
*  say in front of an audience to know how to say it.
*  Exactly.
*  And you just say hear it for yourself too and you need to actually the whole thing is it's
*  a framework for you being in the moment talking about that thing.
*  And if you can like if you can set that framework up well on a piece of paper on a computer
*  screen that's great.
*  But then you review it and then you keep tweaking it and you keep fucking with it.
*  But also if I don't write I just feel like I'm why am I not working hard at this.
*  And that gives me anxiety of being like I remember the first lesson in martial arts
*  that I had the first lesson in my life.
*  I we have compulsory military service in Estonia which I didn't do.
*  I regret it.
*  The only reason I didn't do it is I did sports and guys who went to do the military service
*  they ate shit food got back injuries came back and they lost a year in their athletic
*  life and a year as you know in an athletic version.
*  That's that's huge.
*  So I didn't do that.
*  I regret that.
*  The first lesson I got through martial arts was that why I wasn't successful in mixed
*  martial arts wasn't because I'm physically not I wasn't talented.
*  But the reason I wasn't successful was because I always thought about I wanted the accolades.
*  I wanted to be the cool guy who gets the head kick kisses the girl.
*  Right.
*  And it's cool.
*  You didn't want to deliver.
*  I didn't want during practice.
*  I would be daydreaming like jujitsu classes when my when Britt is talking about arm bar
*  defense I'd be daydreaming about what song am I going to come out to.
*  You know hilarious showman.
*  And I would go.
*  This is just boring.
*  I want to go spar.
*  So I would go to Thai boxing clubs and spar and have fun with my friends.
*  I would build a fake ring in our gym and we would do all the cool stuff that we wanted
*  to do.
*  And then I remember maybe a year later there was this there was a nerdy guy who started
*  same year as me.
*  No nerdy class not physically not gifted at all.
*  A year later I spar with him and he this fucking nerd is fucking me up with a jab.
*  But that's because he gave he had mad time.
*  We always call interesting this this expression called mad time.
*  Sure.
*  Oh you can be amazing and talented and a fucking beast.
*  But if I do 400 hours and you do 22 no matter at the end of the day I'm going to get you
*  because I have mad time.
*  Especially with jujitsu.
*  Especially.
*  But it's it's also how much energy are you putting towards a thing.
*  Exactly.
*  That's really what it is.
*  And it wasn't that and that and that's what I learned about the whole thing.
*  I was like yeah he was putting energy into the universe and committing to something.
*  Yeah.
*  And putting that out there.
*  And even though it's also you're looking for a result and he's involved in the process
*  you have to trust the process.
*  That's the process of writing.
*  Exactly.
*  And this is one thing I tell comics all the time they always say I write on stage.
*  I'm like bro I do too.
*  I do too.
*  We all do especially when you do bottom of the barrel.
*  You always write on stage.
*  You're fucking around.
*  I fuck around all the time.
*  It's fun.
*  It's fun to fuck around.
*  Most of my bits come like this.
*  Sometimes they do.
*  But also you can write.
*  Yeah.
*  This doesn't hurt you to write.
*  It doesn't hurt you.
*  Me preparing for this live special made me really concentrate on like tightening up segues.
*  I didn't want anything to be clunky.
*  I wanted to like really make sure that I had it fucking polished down.
*  Jerry Seinfeld had a great quote where he goes like that a comedian told him yeah write
*  on stage.
*  He said I'll see you in 20 years.
*  You can write on stage.
*  There was a great article that was out that was about Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock.
*  I think it was in Fortune magazine.
*  See if you could find it.
*  But it was essentially they were saying Chris Rock said this best.
*  The guy was going you know what do you do during the day goes I don't do nothing but
*  I do every open mics every night.
*  And he said during the day is where you make your money.
*  At night is when you collect it.
*  Wow.
*  Look at that.
*  You collect your money at night but you make it during the day.
*  So true.
*  Because the performance is just a byproduct.
*  It's a great article.
*  It's the perfect mindset especially coming from a guy like Chris who's you know put out
*  bigger and blacker and was the other one that was like is to is to great ones when he first
*  came and then was the other one.
*  Bring the pain bring the pain.
*  Those two are some of the greatest comedy specials in the history of the world.
*  And that guy man like listen to him whatever the fuck he has.
*  He used to come to the comic store and he had a very unique strategy.
*  He would come to the comic store with premises and like ideas that he had.
*  But he did not have them worked out and he would just eat shit like try to eat like try
*  like let it be like let there be like some blank spots.
*  Let there be some dead air and force himself to come up with the funny and find the funny.
*  And then you'd see it revised the next night and he's here.
*  That was what they said about prior.
*  They said prior would show up at Tuesday with a bunch of ideas for bits and they would bomb.
*  And then on Wednesday they might bomb a little less.
*  And then on Thursday they would start kicking.
*  And then Friday came along and he was in the maid room murdering with some shit that he
*  came up with on Tuesday.
*  But that's because those guys aren't scared to stare down the bull.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Because a lot of guys get their first 20 and they're so scared of letting it go because
*  it was so hard.
*  So hard.
*  And it's hard.
*  People always say oh it's hard to be an open mic.
*  No bro.
*  It's hard to be Chris Rock.
*  It's hard to be an open mic too.
*  No it is but what I mean is that.
*  All of it's hard.
*  It may be harder to be an open mic because you don't know what the path is.
*  You don't even know how to get funny.
*  But what I mean by that is that the open mic, how many guys did, when you started coming,
*  how many guys did you know who were so much funnier than you just because they played
*  poker without chips on the table.
*  They would show up on their terms.
*  Go on on their favorite room.
*  Do their favorite material.
*  They would have a couple of drinks.
*  But they would then disappear.
*  And then when they get the weekend and it's Thursday, you've got to be funny at 8 o'clock.
*  Friday you've got to be funny at 7 and 10.
*  They would kind of fall apart because they're only playing poker by their rules when they're
*  comfortable with their friends in their favorite rooms.
*  But can you be a professional five times a week?
*  Also when you feel uncomfortable going to this new place and then you know you have
*  to do a long time, do you have the stamina to keep that party mind going on for 45,
*  50 minutes?
*  A lot of free balling.
*  Free balling is fine if you're doing 15 minutes.
*  Absolutely.
*  You don't worry about it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  It's on your terms.
*  It's a different thing.
*  It's on your terms.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think if you're going to prepare for a special, you have to do a lot of hours.
*  I don't really think you could get away with, unless you're a guy who does a lot of non-sequiturs,
*  Maybe you could piece together like three or four sets and then put them together for
*  one night.
*  Because if you know how they go, you could do that.
*  Like if you're working in New York City, but there's no substitute for those long ass
*  sets man.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And there's different types of comedians that have a different process.
*  Absolutely.
*  There's no right way of doing it.
*  But are you staring down the bull of your own fears?
*  You know, whereas some guys maybe might not benefit from writing during the day.
*  I get that.
*  But are you maybe overlooking some?
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Everybody benefits from writing.
*  Yeah, that's what I said.
*  I don't believe that.
*  I don't believe that.
*  I believe even the greats, even the greats who don't do it, if they did it, they'd be
*  even better.
*  And I think that because of my own personal experience with writing a lot.
*  Absolutely.
*  When I started, I remember that was exactly the murderers around me who were a bit ahead
*  of me.
*  During the day, they would all have these talks and they would all be like, what is
*  the path and the energy and what is the comedy?
*  What is it?
*  But the whole time, I'm just writing basic, hacky anecdotes because I'm fucking two years
*  in, of course, writing basic, hacky anecdotes.
*  But I remember from sports, I just look because they all came from the either fucking bars
*  or artistic or theater.
*  I came from sports where it's like, no, no, show up for practice.
*  I don't give a fuck if it's your off day.
*  Listen, if your leg hurts, don't kick as hard, but just be there, be cognitively in
*  the process.
*  You're putting energy into the universe.
*  And the way the universe has always worked is if you put the energy out, something's
*  coming back.
*  There's never, I've never known a comedian who has been working hard honestly for 10
*  years and hasn't made it.
*  I've never known a guy.
*  If they have it, if they have the spark, but there have been some people that somehow or
*  some bizarre way that are still there.
*  Yeah, but even that is a true testament of if you just fucking.
*  Right.
*  But yeah, but we can talk about that later.
*  That's not going to be negative.
*  But yeah, you're right.
*  It's like if you I always say to people that are funny at all, like if you do an open mic
*  night and you make me laugh, like you have the hardest part down.
*  You're funny.
*  So true.
*  Now just keep going.
*  Now just keep working at it.
*  And the more time you spend working on it in every realm, whether the more sets you
*  do, the more recordings you listen to, the more writing you sit in front of your notepad.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Sit down.
*  Come up with ideas.
*  Mess them around.
*  Mess around.
*  Like go over some of your old notes.
*  You should have old notes.
*  You should have like an orphan baby folder.
*  So like they're orphan jokes of mine.
*  You know, the thing about writing, they always say kill your babies, you know, like for editing.
*  It's hard for writers or hard for anybody who's a creative person.
*  They create something.
*  You don't want to let it go.
*  I like a whole folder of orphan babies.
*  And I'll go back to that folder every now and then.
*  Maybe I need to talk about that again.
*  Maybe I'll find a new way.
*  And so you always have like some fertile land to till.
*  And that's only from writing.
*  If you don't write, then you're just stuck with what's in your mind right now.
*  And what's in your mind right now is probably pretty good.
*  A lot of guys do very well with what's in their mind right now, especially they do a
*  lot of sets.
*  But you're really better off if you also spend some more time working on the ideas in silence
*  by yourself.
*  Just sit there.
*  And you'll every now and then you come up with some of my best lines.
*  I've come up with that way.
*  Exactly.
*  It's out of nowhere.
*  And then the most magical dude, I had that at the Little Boy on Tuesday or doing Bottom
*  of the Barrel where I pull out the subject and there's a like a shelf in my mind that
*  was there.
*  I put that topic there seven, eight years ago.
*  Ah, and then you remember it.
*  Put it there.
*  And I never even thought about it because it was so stupid.
*  It was even comes out of Bottom of the Barrel.
*  Like a little gift from the universe.
*  Then I go to the green room and write it out.
*  Go straight to Fat Man Murder.
*  Yeah, that's the beautiful thing about that place.
*  It really is a true place where you could develop.
*  I'm taking a couple of weeks off and I'll be back.
*  Yeah, hell yeah, dude.
*  It's crazy.
*  I need to just relax.
*  You know, the first time I saw you was in Australia.
*  Comics Lounge Melbourne.
*  One of the door guys, Tim, was a good friend of mine and he writes me during the day, hey,
*  Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  And this was when, because I told you, this was when Tony, like eight years ago, he was
*  already good, but he wasn't the heel that he is now, the guy.
*  But he had that spark because when he opened for you in the theater, I remember he opened
*  with Melbourne, Australia, lots of white people.
*  What is this heaven?
*  And Melbourne is a super liberal, you know, the theater.
*  Ah, the release.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  There needs to be tension for there to be release.
*  And I remember my friend Tim writes me and he goes, oh, Joe Rogan and they're coming
*  too.
*  And it was another guy's, it was like an Australian guy's show or something.
*  You know, that's his headlining show.
*  He was big in Australia, but not like pack out the club, half-papered, older people.
*  You know, it was like a regular crowd, I would say.
*  Nothing superstar rock star shit.
*  And all the open micers, all me, everybody gets back into the room to watch you because
*  you're our first famous guy that we've seen drop into that club.
*  And in our head, you know how open mic, we're all haters, dude.
*  We're all like, let's see this American guy, bomb, you know, because we're all haters at
*  that point.
*  You know, open micers.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think, dude?
*  I'm getting two minutes at this club.
*  What the fuck am I, you know?
*  So we're all like, oh, how's this?
*  And you come, they go from America.
*  And this was, you had the Joe Rogan experience.
*  He was, I think on, you just went from Ustream to YouTube.
*  It was big in the comedy community, but in Australia, pop culture, not that big.
*  You know, you were the fear factor guy, I would say most, just looking at the crowd,
*  what they thought of you.
*  And you get a polite, nothing like it would be today.
*  You get a polite applause and you go out there and it was your triggered set.
*  You did, you did so clever to you, that the opener of your hour and the closer, right?
*  Because I saw you in the next day in the theater.
*  Dude, you were murdering so hard when you had that Kim Kardashian bit, when you're climbing
*  on a stool, you're kicking off the heels.
*  Sweat was dripping because it was summer in Australia.
*  Sweat was dripping down, I remember.
*  And all of us, like comics in the back are like, this is not a crowd that for who Kim
*  Kardashian is a prevalent pop figure, but your bit was so good that it transcends the
*  reference.
*  You know, it's like me as a young kid watching Dave Chappelle doing Crack Baby.
*  I'm an Estonian white kid in a suburb.
*  What do I know about the corner and the projects?
*  I've never seen a black person.
*  But he's, literally never.
*  But his talent transcends the reference.
*  And I remember you were murdering so hard.
*  And that's when I was like, holy fuck.
*  Like because we all thought you're just like a famous guy who just does stand up on the
*  side and we were like, no, this guy's a murderer.
*  And I remember that poor headliner, I mean, rest in peace.
*  And you were like slamming.
*  Well, thanks, brother.
*  Yeah, that was right when I was about to film Triggered.
*  So that shit was tight.
*  And then I remember somebody comes back to me.
*  They know I smoke weed.
*  They go, Mr. Rogan needs weed.
*  And in my head, I'm like, didn't we hang out on this little like balcony area, little fire escape?
*  So let me tell you about this balcony.
*  Hey, we got to go, man.
*  Oh, I'm sorry.
*  I got to wrap this up.
*  Let's wrap it up.
*  Let's wrap it up with this.
*  OK.
*  And I get the weed and I tell my friend, Tim, you see, I'm cool.
*  I'm not going to talk and everybody tried to talk to you there.
*  I'm just going to give you a fist bump on the weed.
*  I go, I have the weed.
*  Tim grabs the weed, turns around and just walks away.
*  And in my head, I'm like, I wish I could have just given you a fist bump.
*  But now nine years later, fuck you, Tim.
*  Fuck you, Tim.
*  You hate her.
*  You took his weed.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That was fun.
*  That was a it's cool.
*  It's always cool to go to a different country and see the scene.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  See and Melbourne had a pretty good scene.
*  And then you murder in the theater.
*  7 a.m.
*  I see you at the UFC, Holy Home, Ronda Rousey, amazing KO.
*  Dude, I go back to bed.
*  I wake up.
*  You're already in LA talking to a scientist engaged.
*  I'm like, this guy fucking.
*  That was like a crazy weekend, you know?
*  Yeah, it's a wild life.
*  Anyway, again, thank you, my brother.
*  Thank you for being at the club.
*  Thanks for being an awesome guy.
*  It's great having you around.
*  Thank you so much.
*  It's great to see you flourish and if people get a chance to see you live, don't miss it.
