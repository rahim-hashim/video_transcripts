# Joe Rogan Experience #1366 - Richard Dawkins
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 21, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bN4spt3744)
*  All right, here we go. Mr. Dawkins, thank you very much for being here. I really appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm a huge fan of your work and we have a new book out, Outgrowing God.
*  When does it come out? Is it out now?
*  It is out now.
*  It is now. Like this week, right?
*  Last week, I think.
*  I read The God Delusion in preparation for this. Can you pull that microphone right up to your face?
*  Just get it about a fist away from your face. You don't have to move.
*  Okay.
*  Microphone, move for you.
*  Okay.
*  I'm a huge fan of your work and I always wanted to ask you,
*  you go so hard against religion and you have for so long,
*  has there ever been a time where you've gotten fatigued from this? Where you're like,
*  I just leave this to somebody else?
*  Well, obviously not because I just produced another one.
*  It's not so hard as you think. I mean, you remember it as hard,
*  but actually if you read it again, I think you'd find it was not as hard as you remember.
*  I didn't mean hard in a negative sense. I mean, you push.
*  Okay.
*  You're so enthusiastic about your atheism.
*  I'm enthusiastic.
*  I'm also humorous. I mean, I like to think it's a funny book,
*  but a lot of people do think it's hard in the other sense.
*  Sometimes when they read it again, they realize actually, no, it's more humorous.
*  It's not so edgy, not so hard hitting as they originally thought it was.
*  Well, I think that's probably because you've had some interviews in the past where you have talked
*  to some fiercely religious people and you've had some cantankerous interactions with them.
*  I think maybe so they associate you with having this almost aggressively atheistic stance.
*  Yes. Well, perhaps you're thinking of Bill O'Reilly. I'm not sure.
*  I mean, he's aggressive, all right.
*  Yeah. In the other way.
*  I did once had to tell him, will you please stop interrupting me and let me talk?
*  So that might give the slight impression that I'm aggressive.
*  Now, what was that BBC documentary that you had done?
*  I've done several.
*  The one where you had gone and interviewed a bunch of different religious people.
*  Yes, that was not BBC. That was Channel 4, which is the commercial station.
*  Yes, I interviewed Ted Haggard and a guy who ran a thing called Hell, not Hell Holes,
*  Hell Houses, where they tried to terrify children. I mean, freak them out with
*  horrible little play, little playlets. The devil coming on with horns and glowing eyes and.
*  I actually participated in a reenactment of that play in Los Angeles back in the day,
*  a comedy reenactment. Bill Maher was in it. A bunch of other comedians were in it and we
*  read word for word the script and we acted it out in front of a live audience. So people would come
*  through the Hell House, this haunted house, but instead it was people knew it was all comedians
*  reading it and they're like, is this really the words that they said? It was so preposterous that
*  it actually, without being a parody, it actually played out like a comedy.
*  Well, when we filmed it, we filmed them doing the play and then we filmed me interviewing
*  the perpetrator, Michael, somebody or other. And I said to him, what's your target audience? And
*  he said 12. And I said, really? Are you really serious that you like to? He said,
*  hell is such a terrible place that anything I can do to persuade children not to sin and they must
*  acknowledge Jesus and so on is worth it. I thought that was a deeply immoral thing to say,
*  but I think he was sincere. Well, I would agree with you. It's very disturbing. There's a great
*  documentary on it as well for someone who wants to see the thought process behind them creating
*  this. But one of the things that I really enjoyed about The God Delusion is that you kind of outlined
*  every single possible argument against atheism and then had a counter to it in advance. If you
*  have a soft position, look at chapter one. If you look at this, look at chapter two. And you
*  outlined that in the preface before you got into it. Yes. Well, I tried to as persuasive as possible.
*  The new book, Outgoing God, is sort of aimed at a younger audience. And I like to think it can be
*  read at any age, but being aimed at a younger audience is a bit shorter and perhaps a bit easier
*  to follow. I'm not sure. Why is it that you think that there are so many religions and that basically
*  every single civilization throughout human history has had some sort of deity, some sort
*  of higher power? It's amazing the way they split and diverge and diverge and diverge. It's as though
*  they somehow can't get along with each other. And maybe new leaders arise who have a leadership
*  complex or something and want to found their own sector. Time and time again, you have breakaway
*  religions, breakaway faiths. I don't know what the psychological reason for it is,
*  but what I have noticed is that they usually hate the religion, which is the closest to their own,
*  more than they do more distant ones. And that has a certain biological ring to it too.
*  That just kind of makes sense to a biologist looking at diverging species.
*  Well, it almost seems like if you were studying human beings, if you were something that was
*  completely alien to our civilization, our culture, and you were looking at this strange tendency
*  to believe in something that there's no proof of and devote a massive amount of energy into
*  defending that, put it into your songs and put it into your pledge of allegiance and all these,
*  which of course was not until the 1950s. But all the different things that people have done
*  in so many different cultures in regards to religion, it almost seems like a natural aspect
*  of being a human being. You're right that they put an enormous amount of energy and effort and
*  expense and time and cost and share. I mean, some of the extreme sex which whip themselves
*  with horrible weapons, actually bleed, scar their own backs. It's very, very surprising to a
*  biologist who you think we would think that they would be more interested in surviving and reproducing.
*  But no, there's something about religion that makes them go to extremes of costliness.
*  And I don't get it, I must say.
*  I've thought about this so many times. Do you think that it is in some way a counter to the
*  sort of existential angst that comes from being a finite life form, from being a thinking conscious
*  finite life form that's aware of its own demise, where it's coming. So it has to formulate some
*  purpose and some meaning. And a hope of an afterlife as well. Yes, that is the purpose
*  and meaning, right? Yes, I suppose that's right. Yes, I think that's right. I can understand why
*  people might want to believe a priest who comes along and tells them you don't have to worry about
*  death because you're going to survive it. I'm less understanding of people who make up stories
*  to comfort either themselves or other people. I mean, a made up story should not be comforting.
*  I don't understand how a made up story can be comforting. Of course, if you make it up and
*  persuade somebody else, then they could find it comforting. On the other hand, is an afterlife
*  really all that comforting when you think about half of them believe they're going to go to hell?
*  So is anything but comforting? And also, even if you're not going to hell, if you're going to heaven,
*  if you're going to heaven, eternity in heaven, I mean, sitting in heaven for
*  not just billions of years, but trillions of years. I mean, these are timespans beyond our
*  comprehension. How unbelievably boring it would be. Would it though? I mean, I don't know. I enjoyed
*  life. But if I had to live my life over and over again, infinitely, if I had an infinite number
*  of this exact lives, I don't know how I'd approach that. In the moment, I can enjoy it.
*  I could do with maybe 200 years. But after that, no, I mean, I think that eternity is what's
*  frightening about death. And eternity is best spent under a local under a general anesthetic,
*  which is what's going to happen. Right. Gonzo, alcohol lights, maybe. Yeah. Or maybe not. Have
*  you had any experience with psychedelics? No. Do you have any interest in that? I've been offered
*  to be accompanied on a trip by a very nice woman friend. Yeah. And I've never so far dared take her
*  up on it. How come? I asked advice of a cousin of my father who's just recently died, who was a major
*  expert on psychedelics. And I think he was the one who introduced Aldous Huxley to Met Mescaline,
*  for example. And he judiciously advised against he said that the horrors of a bad trip are so awful
*  that he wouldn't he wouldn't advise somebody to go into it. My friend who's offering me this trip
*  says it would be a relatively low dose and she would take another low dose so she could kind of
*  accompany me. Yeah. And stop me jumping out a window or anything. Well, there's so many stories
*  in so many ancient religions that seem to originate with the consumption of some sort
*  of a psychedelic. Yes. And you know, there's many, including John Marco Oleg grows the sacred
*  mushroom. Jesus was a mushroom. Yes. So I mean, I mean, you can see the connection if you were a
*  primitive person with no access to science and you found some mushroom growing under a tree and
*  consumed it and had this unbelievable experience, you would assume that you've transcended this life
*  and gone into this other realm where God exists. I once thought that I would try a psychedelic when
*  I was on my deathbed. That's it. But what if it was amazing? And you're like, I could have gotten so
*  much done with this. If I had tried this out when I was 30. Yes, maybe you're right. I don't, you know,
*  I don't think anybody should do anything. I mean, I used to, I used to encourage people to do things
*  all the time. Now my thought is do whatever compels you, whatever you feel like it. But
*  I would think that a person like yourself who has this sort of rigorous belief that the lights go
*  out and then that's it. I would think that that would be attractive to just at least dip your toes
*  in. Yes. Yes. Well, don't you think the lights go out? I don't know. You know, I don't know. I've had
*  some pretty profound psychedelic experiences that make me wonder what thoughts are and what
*  consciousness is and whether or not there's some way that it transcends. Well, I wonder what
*  consciousness is, but it's pretty clear that it's to do with brains and brains decay. And so I
*  I wouldn't hold out much hope for you. Well, you might be right. Yeah, you might be. Well,
*  certainly consciousness does have to do with brains. And we know brain damage severely
*  perturbs consciousness, but there's some interaction with certain chemicals. And that makes this
*  experience far different than what it is when we're on the natch. I believe that. It's still
*  brains though. Yeah. Still brain, but that's it. Reductionist. Nothing wrong with reductionism.
*  Nothing wrong with it. Not saying there is. What is the fiercest opposition that you've ever had
*  to your work? Fiercest or most cogent? Well, let's try both. Fiercest meaning the most,
*  the who has become the most angry at your work and most cogent meaning.
*  Ted Haggard, maybe. That guy really? Yeah. Well, he's such a preposterous person. For folks who
*  don't know, he was a guy who he was, he was pretty anti-gay, right? And then it turned out he was
*  smoking meth and having sex with gay prostitutes and, you know, the whole deal. And which is
*  whenever someone to me is ridiculously anti-gay, I always assume that they're gay.
*  I always assume, well, this guy's he's just trying to like divert attention. Yes. Well, he was very
*  hostile and in a very weird way. It's all on television. That was before his scandal.
*  Oh, yes. You got ahold of him before the scandal. Yeah. Yeah, he was. He was very hostile with you.
*  I remember that he was aggressive, like angry, almost tried to run us over in the car park
*  afterwards. I think he didn't know who I was when he interviewed me. And then I think he went away
*  afterwards and Googled me. Was there Google back then? I don't think there was. I think that's
*  Navigator. Maybe it was. Yeah, that's so he was the fiercest in terms of his reaction. He had a very
*  nasty, snarly face and he looked at the fiercest. Yes. Yeah. Has anybody had a good debate with you
*  about it where they had some good points? Not good points. No. I mean, I've had very amicable
*  debates with religious people, bishops, archbishops and people like that, the chief rabbi of Britain.
*  Very amicable. And the former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, is such a nice man
*  and intelligent in the literal sense that he finishes your sentences for you. And so he
*  clearly understands exactly what you're trying to say and gets there before you finish the sentence.
*  But then for some weird reason doesn't agree with it.
*  Yeah, that is the conundrum. Super intelligent people who are deeply religious and who believe
*  everything, everything from the resurrection to the Virgin Mary to everything. I assumed that he
*  would believe possibly in the resurrection because they regard that as a kind of non-negotiable part.
*  What surprised me was that he turned out to believe in all the other miracles as well,
*  which I thought sophisticated theologians just don't do. I thought they said, oh, that's just
*  a metaphor or it didn't really happen or that's not important, just symbolic or something like
*  that. But he really believes in the whole lot. What was his interpretation of things like death
*  for adultery and things along those lines? I didn't ask him about that. I simply don't know.
*  Well, what's fascinating to me is not just the old religions, but really the young religions. The
*  young religions as I've gotten older are more interesting. Things like Mormonism and more
*  particularly Scientology, which is even more preposterous, probably the most preposterous one
*  that we have. Those are really interesting to me. They are interesting because they're so young that
*  we can see how they grew up. You can see the actual process. Mormonism, I'm
*  depressed by how successful it is. Actually, Scientology as well, but Mormonism since,
*  I mean, we know Joseph Smith was a charlatan. Everything about him screams charlatan.
*  And yet plenty of respectable people, including presidential candidates, men in suits,
*  appear to believe it. In the case of, I mean, I discussed it in Outgrowing God. In addition to
*  the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith purported to translate another book called the Book of Abraham,
*  which was in a different language, some ancient Egyptian language. And he published his full
*  translation of the Book of Abraham, which he said was all about Abraham's journey to Egypt and lots
*  of detail about Egypt and Abraham in Egypt and things. The original manuscripts were destroyed
*  in a fire in Chicago, and so he was safe from anybody exposing his translation. It was discovered
*  that actually some of these manuscripts had survived and they had not been destroyed.
*  And modern scholars who actually knew the language, including some Mormon scholars,
*  translated it again, a true translation, which had nothing whatever to do with Abraham or Egypt.
*  This is absolute cast iron demonstration that Joseph Smith was a complete fake and charlatan.
*  This is fully documented, and yet they go on believing that he was a prophet.
*  And he was 14 too when he came up with it, which is even more bizarre.
*  Was he?
*  Yeah. 1820. He was 14 years old.
*  I didn't know that.
*  He was a little kid. Just a boy with a fantastic imagination and it sort of caught fire.
*  Yes, the golden plates which disappeared.
*  Yeah, and the seer stone.
*  It's just so strange to me that it persists, but the people that practice the religion are so nice.
*  They're some of the nicest cult members I've ever met in my life.
*  Yes, I suppose so.
*  Mormons are my favorite. They're my favorite.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  Absolutely my favorite.
*  Even when they come on your doorstep and sort of...
*  They haven't.
*  If they did, maybe I'd change my tune.
*  You all right over there, Jamie?
*  Good. Okay.
*  I'm also very interested in the perhaps even more recent things like the cargo cults of the Pacific
*  where, again, these actually arose in living memory.
*  And the worship of John Frum in some of the islands in the Pacific where you can see what happened.
*  And this gives you an insight into what must have happened with Jesus
*  where the gospels weren't written down until decades after Jesus' death,
*  if he ever lived, which he probably did.
*  And so having seen how easily the cargo cults arose, people who
*  worshiped John Frum, worshiped Prince Philip, believed that cargo planes were sent by their
*  ancestors and would build dummy airfields with dummy control towers and radar dishes
*  and dummy planes on the airfield and things.
*  This is all within living memory.
*  And something like that, it's just so transparent that something like that went on in the early church.
*  Well, the Scientology story to me is the most bizarre.
*  Because it was literally, I mean, if you wanted to have a crazy religion,
*  what would be the most ridiculous religion for people to believe in?
*  Well, and he even announced he was going to do it.
*  They still believe it.
*  But if you're going to have the most ridiculous religion, you would say, well,
*  get a fiction author, particularly a bad one, a bad science fiction author who walked around
*  in a jacket with medals on that he gave himself and have that guy create a religion, a guy who is
*  really self-diagnosing his own psychological issues and trying to deal with them through
*  this concept of Dianetics.
*  Yeah, I'm sure you read Lawrence Wright's book.
*  I haven't read it, but I mean, I know the story.
*  The book is fantastic.
*  It's just so crazy.
*  And it's so strange that to this day, people are clinging to it.
*  And it makes you wonder, like, what is it about these systems of belief
*  that are so intrinsically attractive to people, so uniquely a part of being a person,
*  these belief systems?
*  I think I get it when there's childhood indoctrination involved.
*  But in the case of Scientology, some of the celebrities who joined it,
*  that's not childhood indoctrination.
*  That's just sheer rank stupidity.
*  I think there's also an element of being a part of a tribe.
*  Especially the celebrity thing, because I've met quite a few of them out here,
*  especially in the early days, the 90s, before the internet came along and sort of exposed a lot of
*  the stuff, and South Park, before they came along and exposed it.
*  There was quite a few people that thought that there was a career advantage
*  to being a part of Scientology.
*  There were so many successful actors that were a part of Scientology, and they were,
*  they seemed to be disciplined and focused, and they were avoiding drugs and all the
*  pitfalls of Hollywood fame and stardom.
*  And they also seemed to be helping each other, that Hollywood directors,
*  who were also Scientologists, would look towards hiring Scientologists, producers, and actors.
*  They're kind of Freemasonry then.
*  Yes, yes.
*  There's some strange thing that we are all very attractive,
*  attracted to being a part of a tribe, and being a part of,
*  even if the belief system is ridiculous, if we are in a group that subscribes this belief system,
*  it's very attractive to people.
*  That's a very important point, and tribalism is a very important part of human
*  human nature, a very bad part, I think.
*  A rewarding part as well.
*  Well, I suppose so.
*  Steven Pinker, you probably had him at some point, he makes the point that
*  so much of what we humans generally believe is not about evidence, but is about,
*  is this part of my tribe?
*  What does my tribe believe this?
*  And Jonathan Hyatt also makes the same point about Republicans and Democrats.
*  There's a fierce tribalism going on, and it accounts for so much of what people believe,
*  as opposed to actually looking at the evidence.
*  The Center for Inquiry, which my foundation has just merged with, is of course all about
*  trying to get people off that sort of thing, that of irrationality,
*  and to instead evaluate claims on the basis of evidence, critically evaluated scientific evidence.
*  But it's hard, because people have other motives, like emotion, tribalism, things like that.
*  Well, people find great comfort in these belief systems.
*  It gives them sort of, I've often said that it gives them some sort of like a scaffolding
*  for their structure of the world, their ethics, their morals.
*  They can use religion as some sort of a mechanism to help them get by,
*  something that they can climb on to ease some of the confusion of the unknown.
*  I'm sure that's true, but I don't understand why anybody therefore thinks that therefore
*  the religion is true.
*  Why would you think that?
*  Because it provides you with a scaffold you can climb on.
*  That makes it true.
*  I could understand you erecting a scaffold that was say gymnastics, or a certain diet,
*  or something like that, but a belief about the universe, that's either got to be true or not.
*  And it doesn't make it true just because it's comforting or provides you with a scaffold to climb on.
*  Well, it's almost like it's a spiritual system, like a placebo effect, like a spiritual placebo effect.
*  And by believing that this is true, it gives you this comfort and allows you to condense
*  your thoughts into a better path.
*  The placebo effect, of course, is very real, and doctors know about it.
*  But did you know that the placebo effect works even if the patient is told it's a placebo?
*  Yes.
*  That I don't get.
*  Incredible.
*  That's incredible, isn't it?
*  Yeah, it's very strange.
*  Well, sometimes people doing things and knowing that they're doing things
*  gives them this sort of feeling of momentum, of accomplishment, of progress.
*  And I think so many people are just so adrift and don't have focus that even just telling them,
*  hey, you're going to be a part of this program, this program to treat X, Y disease, whatever it is.
*  And here's this thing, like just focusing on it.
*  Well, I think the main reason why so many people believe in homeopathy,
*  which not only doesn't work but cannot work, is the placebo effect.
*  It's part of they're going to get better anyway, of course, but it's also the placebo effect that
*  homeopathic, I won't say doctor, homeopathic practitioner gives them a nonsensical piece of
*  medicine. And they believe it's going to work. And so it does. And so the placebo effect is important.
*  The CFI Center for Inquiry has actually got a lawsuit going on at the moment against pharmaceutical
*  shops selling homeopathic remedies alongside genuine ones. We can't stop them actually selling
*  homeopathic remedies, but we can try and do is stop them putting them on the same shelf
*  as though there's no difference between them. But my colleague, Nick Humphrey, who's a psychologist,
*  very insightful one, thinks you could actually even justify homeopathy on the grounds that
*  homeopathic practitioners are allowed to prescribe placebos. They call them homeopathic,
*  but they are placebos. Whereas real doctors are not allowed to prescribe. They used to.
*  Real doctors used to prescribe placebos all the time. But they're now no longer allowed to
*  because it violates human rights. But homeopaths are allowed to bizarrely because they don't call
*  them placebos. If they did, they wouldn't be allowed to. Well, I have a similar thought about
*  chiropractic work, that chiropractors, you know, do relieve pain from some for some people,
*  but there's no reason why it works. I would not be totally surprised if it worked. I don't haven't
*  looked into it enough. I would absolutely be surprised if homeopathy works. It cannot work
*  because there's no active ingredient. I can't wait to tell you the story of chiropractic medicine
*  that was created by a guy who was a magnetic healer. It was murdered by his own son, and his
*  son took over the business and started saying that it can cure everything from leukemia to heart
*  disease, everything all by manipulating the spine. Yes, it was made done in the 1800s and there's no
*  science behind it at all. But yet so many people have found pain relief and chiropractors today.
*  It's weird to lump them all in together, but many chiropractors today do do good work because they
*  incorporate legitimate modalities in terms of like rehabilitation, like cold laser and all these
*  different massage remedies and all these different things that actually physically work. I know a
*  woman who is a horse chiropractor, she does chiropractic on horses. But the point I'm trying to make is that
*  whereas it's an empirical question whether chiropractic works, in the case of homeopathy,
*  it cannot work because the dilution is such that there's nothing there physically.
*  Right, there's no chemical reason. One of the things they say, it can work because water has
*  a memory, but if they could prove that water has a memory, they'd get the Nobel Prize for Physics
*  and they're not going to. One of the things that I really enjoyed about your book was
*  when you explained to people that everyone who practices a religion is an atheist,
*  you're just an atheist in regards to Zeus or Apollo or 999 other gods. Yes, and that's a home
*  run with this argument. Some of us just go one god further. Yes, but that really is a home run
*  because this concept of, me and my friends jokingly would always say praise Odin when anything would
*  happen that was pretty good or cool. We say praise Odin and I started doing it online and
*  people really got into saying praise Odin about certain things. I rather like that, yes. Some
*  people got mad at me. They actually got mad that I was, you're mocking Christianity by saying praise
*  Odin. Of course you are. Why not? I wasn't even really. I was just having fun. I was having fun
*  because Odin seemed like a cool god, you know, it's an old school god. I mean, it's the god of the Vikings.
*  Douglas Adams wrote a lovely book called The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul in which the
*  Norse gods are part of it and Odin in that book has got old and senile and he just lies in bed
*  all the time and asking for clean sheets every day and Thor is out there doing mischief with his
*  great hammer and things. At one point Odin sees, gets Thor super glued to the floor and thinks
*  it's a wonderful story. The vast number of different religions, I mean the incredible number,
*  how many actual religions are there? Thousands. Thousands. Yes, I forget how many thousands.
*  Many of them share similar belief systems and it's really interesting when you see how they're,
*  like, you know, the Noah's Ark story is very similar to the Epic of Gilgamesh and there's
*  so many that you see like, oh, they probably told this to someone else and these people moved and
*  traveled on and it's just amazing that that concept is alien to people. When I was a boy,
*  I was raised Catholic and I had an aunt who was Jewish and my uncle married my aunt and he had to
*  convert to Judaism and it was like a big deal in the family. Everybody would talk about it
*  and there was no anger. Everybody loved my aunt. She's a great lady but it was just strange that
*  he was converting to this other religion. I remember I was five years old when this was
*  going on and I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what do you mean another religion?
*  Yes. I was like, what's going on? And they were like, oh, she's Jewish. I go, what does that mean?
*  What do you mean she's Jewish? And they had explained it to me. I go, okay, but she believes
*  in God. Like, yeah, they believe in God. Okay. So why is it a different thing? Well, they believe
*  Jesus was a different kind of a thing. They don't necessarily believe he was the God that we think
*  he was. But if it had been Hindu, they'd have had to explain to you they believe in
*  hundreds of gods. Yes. Yeah. And then we'd have to go way back. Yeah. It's just when you first hear
*  that, I mean, that was probably put the first seeds of doubt in my head when I was a young boy,
*  when I was like, wait, well, there's more than one. I'll never forget that moment because we're all
*  sitting around the dinner table and I was just a little kid and I'm thinking, what do you mean
*  there's another one? I think that's a very powerful way of getting to children is to just
*  simply tell them that. Yes. Telling them nothing but facts. You're not indoctrinating them. Right.
*  You're just telling them there are lots of different religions and Hindus believe in
*  hundreds of gods and Jews believe in one God and Muslims believe in one God and they don't believe
*  in Jesus and just lay out all the different religions. That would be a very good educational
*  exercise. Has there ever been a civilization that existed without belief in a higher power?
*  I don't think there has. No. Of course, there are plenty of individuals who educate that to
*  not believe in a higher power, but I think probably true to say that every, I mean,
*  anthropologists might deny them and there might be some tribe that doesn't, but I suspect they all do.
*  Well, there's been some tribes that worshiped animals and particularly animals that they
*  survived off of. Yes, yeah. And river gods and thunder gods and moon gods and sun gods and fire
*  gods and things, yes. When you look at human civilization and you go back to the origins of
*  religion and you look towards the future, do you envision a time where humanity is free of what you
*  would consider irrational belief systems or belief systems are not based on fact? I do. I'm not sure
*  that it'll come soon, but I do and I look forward to that time, of course. I think we're moving in
*  the right direction and the figures bear that out. Even in America, which is off the scale of western
*  civilizations, even in America, the number of people who now subscribe to a religion
*  is dropping dramatically and the number who say they have no religion is now about 25 percent.
*  That's a lot. That's a great deal and that compares to any one particular Christian denomination.
*  And yet politically, that group, the nuns, the no-beliefs, have no lobby. They have no powerful
*  pressure group. So politicians will go out there and suck up to, I don't know, the Irish lobby,
*  the Polish lobby, the Jewish lobby, the Catholic lobby, etc. But the atheist lobby
*  hasn't got his act together or is only just now beginning to get his act together.
*  Well, politically, I think people are terrified of the concept because it's such a
*  long branch to go out on. One of the things that you brought up in God Delusion was the willingness
*  of people to vote for a gay candidate for president, a black candidate for president, a woman candidate
*  for president, but then an atheist, which is, I believe, 40 percent. They think that you've got to
*  have a belief in some kind of higher power in order to be moral. But the weird thing is that
*  it doesn't have to be the same higher power as the one you believe in. Anyone will do as long as
*  there is one. But if you don't believe in a higher power, you must be immoral. And that is totally
*  ridiculous when you think about the horrible immorality of, for example, both the Bible and
*  the Koran, which are horrific in the sense that if you actually got your morals, if you got your
*  moral values from the Old Testament or the Koran, and they share them a great deal, of course,
*  you would be stoning adulterers to death and stoning people to death for breaking the Sabbath
*  and doing sacrifices, human sacrifices and animal sacrifices, all sorts of horrible things,
*  which of course do go on now in Islamic countries especially. Gay people getting thrown off high
*  buildings and women being beheaded for the crime of being seen with a man, not their husband and
*  that kind of thing. So that we can see what you get when you get your morality from an Abrahamic
*  scripture. And yet there are still people in this country who say you cannot be moral unless you
*  believe in a higher power. What do you think, let's extract this concept of a higher power,
*  let's get rid of it, let's get rid of it. Where do you think people get their morals and their ethics
*  from? That's a profoundly difficult question. We clearly don't get them from religion. And yet we
*  get them from somewhere and you can demonstrate that by the fact that the moral values of any
*  particular century are markedly different from those of other centuries, even decades. So in
*  the 21st century, we here now have moral values which are really significantly different from
*  100 years ago or 200 years ago or 300 years ago. And within any one of those centuries,
*  you could take people who are in the vanguard of moral progress, for example in the 19th century,
*  Abraham Lincoln, Charles Darwin, T. H. Huxley would have been on the liberal progressive end
*  of the spectrum and other people would have been on the opposite end. But even Abraham Lincoln,
*  for example, made a speech that I quoted in Outgrowing God in which he said, of course,
*  nobody would seriously think that black people are the equal of white people.
*  Nobody would seriously say that black people should be allowed to vote or should be allowed
*  to marry white people. This is Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves and was, as I say, in the
*  forefront of progressive thought. Charles Darwin, again, was in favor of freeing the slaves. He was
*  passionately anti-slavery. But he too thought that there was no question about black people being
*  equal of white people. They obviously weren't. And Huxley, Thomas Huxley, again, Darwin's bulldog,
*  thought the same way. Now those people were at the forefront, as I say. Today, they would still be in
*  the forefront and they would be horrified to look back on what they said in the 19th century. Well,
*  something is changing as the centuries go by. In Outgrowing God, I call it something in the air,
*  which of course doesn't explain anything. But what I mean by that is that it's not literally
*  hovering in the air, but it's a collection of, oh, conversations between people, dinner party
*  conversations, parliamentary decisions, congressional debates, judicial decisions by judges, juries,
*  newspaper articles, journalism, all these things together conspire together to produce something in
*  the air, something that defines a given century or maybe even a given decade with the moral values
*  of that decade. The knowledge base, which is just so superior today in terms of what the general
*  public has access to, in terms of what we understand about human beings. It's just different
*  than it was back then. And it continues to be different. And now with the internet,
*  we have so much more access to these conversations. And it's not just about being at a dinner table
*  with the right people. You can watch YouTube videos of yourself debating religious scholars.
*  Yes, so that progress of something in the air will, as it were, take on an accelerated pace
*  because of the internet. And I think that's a very hopeful sign. Of course, the internet also
*  can be used for the opposite purpose. But I think there's a kind of asymmetry there because,
*  especially if you look at benighted areas of the world like Afghanistan and Pakistan, where
*  until recently, the idea of being an atheist was simply inconceivable. It was off the radar.
*  They didn't even consider it. It wasn't something that they thought was possible.
*  Now they do because they got the internet. And we've got a project within CFI of downloading
*  free of charge as PDFs, several of my books, including The God Delusion, and will be outgrowing
*  God as well. And these are being downloaded by large numbers of people. The first PDF download
*  of the Arabic edition of The God Delusion was downloaded 13 million times, Arabic edition,
*  13 million times. So now they are being exposed to the possibility of atheism,
*  which wasn't a possibility. Of course, the internet is also exposing them to Islamic propaganda.
*  But they've had that all along from imams, mullahs, and their madrasa schools. But now they've got it
*  coming the other way as well. And I have great hope that the internet will mark a turning point.
*  Do you think that people need a structure? And is it possible to give them a secular structure
*  that mimics religion? There's certainly some sort of a community aspect.
*  Yes, possibly. I don't feel that very strongly myself, but I'm aware that many other people do.
*  And there are people who are interested in starting up sort of atheistic or secular
*  meetup groups on Sundays and lectures. Yeah, my worry is that that will become a sex cult.
*  I never thought of that. Always seems to have someone who gets in control who winds up having a...
*  Well, as religious cults usually do. I mean, there's extraordinary stories. That awful man,
*  what was he called, who ended up taking his followers to a South American jungle and...
*  Jim Jones. Jim Jones. Diana.
*  And I mean, he had this gigantic harem of all the young women.
*  They always do.
*  Yes.
*  Waco, he had one.
*  Waco, exactly the same.
*  They all do.
*  Yes. Well, okay. I mean, I don't think that's happening so far with the secular ones.
*  I hope not. The worry is that once someone gets into a position of being the person who gets to
*  speak, the alpha, the one who's on the stage addressing people and giving them the doctrine,
*  that he becomes far too attractive for his own good.
*  Well, that would not surprise any naive Darwinian who would say,
*  what on earth do you think the dominant chimpanzee becomes dominant for?
*  Right.
*  That's what it's all about.
*  Exactly. There's got to be a way to avoid that though. I mean, maybe the exposing nature of the
*  internet would be the thing that... The actual thing that mitigates that.
*  I'm not personally that interested in meetup groups and community centers and things.
*  Right.
*  People are. All I really care about is scientific truth. And that's what I'm trying to propagate.
*  That's very admirable. But I think for some people, it represents a bonding of the community.
*  You could have concerts and lectures and book clubs.
*  I think when they get together and they talk about all the values that Jesus proposed,
*  if Jesus is the higher power, it gives them this sort of, again, moral scaffolding to live their
*  life.
*  Yes. Well, Jesus would probably on the whole provide a fairly good moral scaffolding. Not
*  totally, but he was ahead of his time anyway.
*  So you do think he was a real person?
*  Most of the scholars I've talked to say he probably was. The evidence is not great, of course, but
*  I think... I don't think it's that big a deal actually, because he... I mean, a wandering
*  preacher called Yeshua or Yahoshua, would not be surprising. I mean, it's a common name.
*  And there are plenty of wandering preachers. What would be very surprising would be if he
*  raised a razzle from the dead and watered it and turned water into wine. And that,
*  of course, didn't. Did not happen.
*  Well, why couldn't people just drink water either? Why do they have to drink wine?
*  He's trying to get people drunk?
*  Well, that's a separate question. But I mean, I think the point I'm making is that it's a very
*  big difference to say, did he exist? And maybe he did, maybe he didn't, who cares really?
*  Or as... that's very different from saying that a miracle worker who really did do miracles rather
*  than countering tricks existed.
*  Yes. What was the... you said that you wrote this, it's a beginner's guide, outgrowing guide.
*  Well, it's for young people. I originally wanted to write a book for young children,
*  and publishers didn't want to do that. So they kept pushing the age range up, and so it stabilized
*  at about 15. But I think 14... well, the first chapter has been read by one 10-year-old to my
*  acquaintance. He loved it. And I think... but really, I'm hoping it'll be read by people of
*  all ages.
*  There's one thing that does happen to some people that are indoctrinated very young,
*  that the experience is so negative to them that they rebel. And they rebel, and then they seek out
*  other ways of thinking, and then you find them eventually abandoning their religion.
*  There's a woman named Megan Phelps. Do you know who she is?
*  I think I do, yes.
*  She's Fred Phelps from the Westboro Baptist Church. She was his granddaughter. And...
*  Yes.
*  Amazing woman. She wound up communicating with people through all things Twitter.
*  Yes.
*  And met her husband.
*  So she rebelled against her grandfather.
*  Yes.
*  Her grandfather.
*  Yes, she wound up leaving the church, and wound up realizing that she was trapped in some sort of
*  a Christian cult, and a very hateful one.
*  Yes.
*  They're the God-hates-fags people, right?
*  And the same was true of Nate Phelps, who was Fred Phelps's son. And he also escaped. He escaped
*  on his 18th birthday. And became an atheist. And became... I think he's actually spoken at some of
*  our conferences from time to time.
*  Yeah, there's hope in that.
*  Yes, there is.
*  It's just when... I like when people can... And she... I've had her on the podcast.
*  She's such a unique woman. And she's so kind. And she's so thoughtful and intelligent. It's
*  hard to believe that she's only been out of this cult for a few years. I mean, Twitter's only been
*  around for 14 years.
*  Why wasn't she ruined by it, you're saying?
*  Yeah. Right. Yeah.
*  Why wasn't she ruined by it? And why... She is so intelligent. How did she exist in that structure
*  while being so intelligent?
*  I agree. But of course, I feel the same way about apparently intelligent people who believe
*  obvious nonsense. And it's hard to understand.
*  It seems to be a part of what we are, though. It seems to be a part of what human beings are.
*  Because it exists in so many different civilizations.
*  Yes, but decreasing numbers of actual individuals.
*  And in places like Holland and Scandinavia, hardly anybody is religious.
*  Really? What are the numbers there?
*  Apart from immigrant Muslims, who still are. But apart from them, I don't know. They're
*  pathetically small.
*  Is there any evidence that that is reaching the Muslim world as well? And that people are?
*  Well, as I was saying, the downloads of my books have been encouraging. We have this thing called...
*  CFI has a thing called the Translation Project, which is specifically in order to do that,
*  in order to take my books, and we hope other people's books as well, and put them into PDFs
*  and then have them available for free download. And I hear evidence from Iran, from Egypt,
*  from Saudi Arabia, from individuals who say, yes, there's now quite a substantial groundswell of
*  anti-religious, anti-Islamic opinion. And I think it's going to increase. And I'm really
*  encouraged by that.
*  One of the things about being Muslim, in my eyes, is very similar to being Jewish, is that
*  Jewish people, there are many Jewish people that are not religious, but they are Jewish. Like I have
*  a very good friend, my friend Ari, he is Jewish, but he is an atheist. And he identifies with being
*  a Jewish person. He has Jewish relatives, his father is a Holocaust survivor, but he looks at
*  it like a thing that he's a part of, like a great long tradition that he's a part of,
*  but he doesn't observe.
*  No, I understand that. I think especially for people of Jewish heritage who have relatives
*  killed in the Holocaust, I think it could be a matter of kind of loyalty to their
*  murdered relatives. I could easily get that. And I think that there are probably
*  cultural Muslims who probably not for the same degree of loyalty, but clearly think of themselves
*  as Muslims. I suppose I meant cultural Anglican in a way. I mean, I sort of, you know, I can sing the
*  hymns and my family observes Christmas in a desolate sort of way.
*  When someone sneezes, do you say bless you?
*  I never did say bless you, actually.
*  What do you say?
*  Nothing.
*  Gesundheit?
*  I don't say anything, but I have no objection to saying Gesundheit, because that was religious,
*  not religious, but my college at Oxford had a fellow who was a famous philosopher, a famous
*  atheist, A.J. Eyre. And when he was senior fellow, he used to say grace at dinner. And when he was
*  asked why, he said, I will not utter falsehoods, but I have no objection to uttering meaningless
*  statements. That's what I feel.
*  Now, when you set out to write this book and write it for young people, how did you structure it in
*  your mind? Did you address, did you think of it as addressing young people with questions that are
*  trying to find?
*  Sort of, yes. It's in two halves. The first half is debunking God. It begins with what we were
*  talking about earlier, the sheer number of different gods, and then moves on to the Bible
*  and how unreliable a source of information it is. And both the Old Testament and the New Testament,
*  they get a chapter each. And then there's a couple of chapters on morality and why you don't need,
*  well, not only do you not need religion to be moral, you better not have religion if you want
*  to be moral. And then the second half of the book is about science, because I think that
*  one of the, possibly the major reason people still cling to religion is a belief that the world is
*  so complicated, especially the living world is so complicated that it cannot be explained by purely
*  scientific means. And so I've set out to disabuse them of that and to show how even the most
*  radically complicated and beautiful and elegant pieces of animal design can be and are explained
*  by science. So that's most of the second half.
*  That's a weird one, right? The argument that it's too complicated for it to not be of the divine.
*  Well, it's, I'm not sure it's weird. It's kind of understandable until you thought about it for a
*  bit, because complicated things don't just happen. Complicated things like these cameras and this
*  computer and things like that, we all know they had to have an engineer design them and factories
*  to build them. And they're very, very improbable things, statistically improbable. The components
*  of a computer or a camera, if you jumble them up at random, they wouldn't work, obviously.
*  So it's kind of pardonable that people should think there must have been a designer.
*  But then you think a bit further and you realise that the designer himself would need just the
*  same kind of explanation. And therefore the designer is not an explanation that flies.
*  And I mean, philosophers before Darwin, philosophers like Hume realised that,
*  but didn't have anything to put in its place. Darwin came along and gave them that which you
*  need to put in its place. And Hume would have loved Darwin if only he'd lived long enough to
*  meet him, to meet his ideas. So I think we have to have sympathy for people who think that
*  complexity must mean design. But nowadays we know better. And that's what the second half of
*  Outgrowing God is about. Who designed the designer? That is the big conundrum for people who believe
*  in God. Yes, it is. And they shrug it off. They say, oh, well, he didn't need a designer. He was
*  always there. Well, my favourite one is why did he wait until 6000 years ago to meet the world?
*  I know, exactly. Yes, that was Christopher Hitch's favourite one.
*  Oh, favourite one. We have in the Centre for Inquiry a programme, it actually came over from
*  the Richard Dawkins Foundation when we merged, called TIEs, the Teacher Institute for Evolutionary
*  Science, which is teaching teachers how to teach evolution. Because middle school teachers in this
*  country apparently are not, don't have science degrees and they don't really know how to counter,
*  how to combat the pushback that they get from children and parents and school boards and things,
*  specifically against evolution. And so we are teaching teachers how to teach evolution. I mean,
*  we run workshops, we've now run one in every state of the union. And that I think is one of the,
*  that's one of the projects of CFI, which is closest to my heart.
*  So back to this book. Sorry, folks, we had a little bit of a technical difficulty.
*  What was your motivation for this? You were just trying to figure out a way to sort of cut off
*  these notions at the root and explain to your people?
*  Yes, I mean, I'm worried about childhood indoctrination and the fact that
*  people who are religious almost certainly adopt the religion of their parents and
*  grandparents and great-grandparents. And so we've got a kind of pseudo-genetic inheritance going on.
*  And I really hate that. I mean, that's wicked. That's indoctrination of children.
*  So I've always wanted to try to break that chain going down the generations. So I've always wanted
*  to write a book for young people. And of course, it's highly necessary when you see the enormous
*  and pernicious influence of fundamentalist religion, especially in this country, actually.
*  Now, the science aspect of it, this is, I mean, obviously, when you're talking about the science
*  of evolutionary biology and natural selection and random mutations and all these different
*  things that lead to a thing becoming a human being over the course of billions of years,
*  it's such a complex idea for people to grasp. How do you condense it and sort of simplify the path
*  introduce them to the works of these great scientists that have sort of established these
*  ideas for them? It's actually a very simple idea, but it plays out in very complex ways.
*  And I think the main problem from a didactic point of view is that the results are so complex
*  that it's hard to believe that anything so simple as natural selection, non-random selection of
*  randomly varying genes could really be responsible for producing something as complicated as a human
*  body. And so it's a matter of getting around, beating that barrier of incredulity. If the idea
*  was more complex, in a way it might be easier. That's the fact that the idea is so simple.
*  I think that may be why it took so long for a Darwin to come on the scene. When you think about
*  the middle of the 19th century, it's rather late, 200 years after Newton did, for the face of it,
*  much cleverer things and yet it was another 200 years after Newton before Darwin came along.
*  I think the reason for that is that the idea is just too simple. It's almost ridiculously simple
*  to be big enough to achieve the feat of explaining the complexity of any part of an animal,
*  but let alone a whole animal. Are there any examples that you point to in nature
*  where observable evolution has occurred? Because there have been some where we've seen observable
*  evolution over the course of the last few years. Yes, Darwin himself made great play of domestication,
*  which is very fast and which has occurred in historical times. We can see how wolves have
*  been changed into Picanises and poodles and Labradors and spaniels. That's a very, very
*  major change to have occurred in only a couple of thousand, a few thousand years.
*  And we see the same with cabbages and with roses and with horses and all sorts of other things.
*  That's artificial selection, not natural selection. Everybody knew about artificial selection,
*  of course, farmers and gardeners, pigeon fanciers, all knew about it. Darwin's great insight was to
*  say you don't need a human selector, you don't need a human breeder to do the transformation from
*  wolf to Pomeranian. Nature does it for you. Non-random survival is the equivalent of a human
*  breeder doing the breeding. So that's what Darwin did. And as for examples of natural selection,
*  we do have some. The famous peppered moths in Britain is one of them. Mosquitoes, I think.
*  Can you explain the peppered moths to people? It's really interesting.
*  Peppered moths is this is a moth called Biston betularia, which is lives on tree bark. It sits
*  on tree bark. It is perfectly camouflaged. It looks like tree bark. So it's light coloured.
*  And then the industrial revolution in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries
*  caused the woods around industrial areas like Manchester and Birmingham to become blackened.
*  And so the moths stood out. They became conspicuous and they were picked off by birds.
*  But mutant moths were black and the mutant black moths were not picked off by birds.
*  And so what happened was that the percentage of black moths in the populations around industrial
*  centres like Birmingham and Manchester, they became much more numerous and the light coloured
*  ones became almost extinct in those areas. But at the same time, the light coloured moths
*  in rural areas, far from industrial pollution like Devon and Somerset,
*  stayed with their original colour. And this was worked out beautifully by a man in Oxford
*  actually called Bernard Kettlewell. And he showed, he actually went and sampled in these different
*  areas and also did experiments showing birds actually picking off light coloured moths in
*  dark areas and vice versa. That's one that we can trace. Yes, because the industrial revolution
*  was only a couple of hundred years ago. So that's an excellent example for people to see. Like this
*  happens, look at this over 500,000 years. Look at this over 10,000 years. This is what happens. This
*  is how random selection. Well, this one happened over only 100 years or 200 years. But that this is
*  how a human being came to be. That this same process. That's right. And the creationists
*  don't like the pepper moth story. They say, oh, well, that's just one gene. They try to say that
*  the same process will not give rise to major changes like from reptiles to birds or mammals.
*  But it just is the same process over a much, much longer period. And what can be achieved
*  in a couple of hundred years is small. What can be achieved in a couple of thousand years
*  is wolf to Pekingese. What can be achieved in a couple of million years is
*  Australopithecus to Homo sapiens. What can be achieved in 100 million years is shrew to human.
*  And a thousand million years would be bacterium to human. Well, maybe not. Maybe 2,000 million years.
*  But it's just that when you're living in the present and you're thinking of yourself and
*  you're thinking of biological life, it's hard for a person to see things on those scales,
*  which is one of the reasons why I think for many people that aren't educated in these
*  sort of subjects to buy into this concept of some sort of intelligent design.
*  Yes. Well, timescales are, we have no concept of millions of years. We can just about cope with,
*  I mean even thousands of years, even going back to the ancient Egyptians,
*  we get a kind of frisson of awe at even wondering what it was like, what the Epic of Gilgamesh,
*  what was it like then. That's nothing compared to evolutionary time. It's not even yesterday.
*  It's a couple of minutes ago. It's ridiculously short time.
*  Well, you have a hard out at four o'clock and that time has come. So I want to thank you for
*  being here and I want to thank you for your commitment over the years to educating people.
*  You have an amazing amount of endurance for this stuff. And because of that, a lot of people have
*  shifted their ideas and gravitated towards science. It's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.
*  Thank you very much. Richard Dawkins, ladies and gentlemen. Bye bye.
*  Good. Thank you. And I have to sign this.
