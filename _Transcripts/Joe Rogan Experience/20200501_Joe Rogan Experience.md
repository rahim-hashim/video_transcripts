# Joe Rogan Experience #1468 - Alonzo Bodden
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cOnu-HMmUk)
*  One hello Alonzo Bowden. Joe I am negative. I know you're positive. I'm positive person
*  I'm a positive person life is good, but the test is negative which that's always what you want to hear
*  After a medical test. Yeah, basically the test is now I can't I'm trying to think is there anyone where you want to hear?
*  The results were positive. I think you always want to hear. Yeah, this one came up negative
*  Yeah, how come no diseases ever make us better?
*  It's like a Marvel comic book
*  Yeah, yeah, how come I can't get hit with gamma radiation, right?
*  Like what could happen to the Hulk and Spider-man every time I get mad at somebody just Hulk out
*  But you know, they never show like everyday things with the Hulk like suppose he's in a car
*  Right now your car the Hulk just grew tore up your car. Hello State Farm. Yeah, you're not gonna believe what just happened in my car
*  Yeah, the concept of the Hulk that's on all the time annoys the shit out of me
*  All the time annoys the shit out of me, you know that he's the Hulk now constantly 24 hours a day
*  Yeah, and then he's smart right the intelligent Hulk. Come on. He's so he's Bruce Banner all the time
*  He's Bruce Banner, but he's also the Hulk. I am
*  We were talking about reading which is what I'm doing now and I got this book it's like ten years of the Hulk
*  It's like a thousand pages of Hulk comics a ten year run and the story is it's great
*  It's the Grey Hulk who was smart but not like the movie one, but he was smarter than the regular one
*  Oh, really? He would only change at night like a vampire like a werewolf. Yeah, so it's like hey
*  This is how much free time I have Joe. Well, I think the new Hulk they probably missed Mark Ruffalo's acting
*  He's such a good actor. Yeah, they didn't have enough room for him to just I mean, there's so many people in that movie
*  Right, you got Captain America. You got all these fucking people you got Iron Man
*  He probably probably like Mark Ruffalo isn't just not talking enough. Yes, most of the time we need him as the Hulk
*  So I got an idea right? Yes, somebody Mark Ruffalo the Hulk all the time. The Hulk has glasses now. He has fucking glasses
*  His glasses it's so ridiculous
*  No, the whole idea you fucks is supposed to be that he's a really smart guy
*  And then he's basically a monster monster with unlimited strength like unlimited power talks like Hulk smash, right?
*  Smart right like in in the Thor movie where he's working as a fighter and he has like a room and he's he's taking
*  Babs and stuff like that was that movie Ragnarok and he didn't see that one. You didn't see that one
*  Yeah, where the Hulk is a fighter
*  He's like a gladiator, but he's treated like a hero and he has all the gladiator stuff
*  You know and it's like yeah, the Hulk wouldn't be doing that like the Hulk would just be smashing and destroying
*  I need to watch that one, but that's see I didn't see this movie. Damn that looks dope. Oh, it's fun
*  Yeah, that's one of the no. This is one of the funny ones man. You got to see that one
*  So the Hulk goes to battle spoiler alert with Thor
*  Yeah
*  He but the Hulk's like a gladiator and Thor ends up on the island and Thor ends up in the ring with him
*  But it's dumb Hulk, right dumb. Hulk's good. He's not not fully done
*  He's not as he's not scientist Hulk, but he's smart enough to hold conversations. What a mismatch that would be if it was real
*  Are you fucking kidding me Thor just relax?
*  I don't how much did you how much Marvel were you into growing up?
*  Yeah, I didn't like DC that much
*  But it was a giant Marvel guy because I was a big Marvel guy and I tell people one of the big things and they brought
*  It up in the first Avenger movie and this was a storyline
*  I remember this the Hulk could never fight Thor because they were both so strong
*  They would destroy the planet because like the Hulk's the Hulk strength was unlimited because the matter he got the stronger
*  He got right and Thor's a god, which is something they never play in the movies
*  But in the comic books every now and then Thor would remind him like I'm a god
*  Yeah, I can destroy the whole planet like that's what my dad is the God
*  That's the problem if he's a god then what the fuck is Captain Marvel cuz that chick trumps everybody
*  Yeah, she comes down and everybody's gonna sit the fuck down. Yeah
*  She's a superhero mom Captain Marvel's the number one
*  So yeah, she's the most powerful
*  Oh, don't want to save the world you call her in that last one like when the Hulk when I mean when Thor went to
*  Where he got the new axe made? Yes. That was like he was like controlling a son, right?
*  Wouldn't they like power of a son was good, you know
*  It's really and and this is what I love and this is what what why women laugh at us because we're having this discussion
*  Yeah, for sure, but it's also what makes
*  What is the the the the really pretty girls name this?
*  Scarlett Johansson. Yeah, what is her character black widow, but she's just kicks ass, right?
*  She's right. You have any power Valentina Shevchenko hanging out with Iron Man
*  Right. That's what it's like. She's she's Valentina Shevchenko's UFC strawweight champion
*  That's what it's like. And the other thing is she shoot like she has a gun
*  But no one they fight can be killed with bullets. I'm sorry. She's a flyweight champion
*  Yeah, no one can be killed with boats. And how about the dude?
*  Jeremy renters character, right? He's got a bow and arrow. Yeah, that is ridiculous. He has a lot of special arrows
*  Like you're fighting aliens with it and you got a bow and arrow it's like man you've skipped generations of weapons technology
*  Yeah, and he seems to never run out arrows. It's amazing. That's that that's the superpower
*  You have this like the balance the imbalance the superpower is so crazy
*  You can have a guy with a bow and arrow or the fucking Hulk, right?
*  Oh, I has no superhuman powers with the exception of the period when using prim particles to become Goliath
*  Okay, whatever dorks
*  He's the very peak of human conditioning sure is he's an exceptional fencer acrobat and a grandmaster marksman
*  Having been trained from childhood in the circus by the criminals trickshot and oh boy
*  Well, I'm a big Jeremy Renner fan. I like that guy a lot
*  Yeah, however, we have to be realistic about superpowers. You got the Hulk on one hand
*  You got Captain Marvel on another hand and a dude who's like an acrobat. Yeah, Hawk. I'm good at shooting shit
*  I think Hawkeye's limit is fighting crime
*  Right like criminals Hawkeye could take down but when
*  Superpowers and aliens and stuff come in that's when you gotta you gotta make some phone calls. Well, I just can't buy
*  Aliens coming at you and you're shooting them with a bow and arrow
*  I just know they came here from another planet
*  Well Captain America like he's just really strong
*  Yeah, but superhuman yes superhuman strength part of a experiment, right? But he's like bulletproof, isn't he? No, no
*  Something
*  Quick no, what's his name Wolverine Wolverine heels?
*  Instantly, I thought Captain America had one of them jammies to not like I don't think like Wolverine
*  He probably heals quicker or could take more pain or something than most Captain America
*  Okay has agility
*  agility strength speed endurance and reaction time superior to any Olympic athlete athlete who ever
*  Competed lol the super soldier formula that he has metabolizes enhance all his bodily functions to the peak of human efficiency
*  Oh, he ain't shit now Iron Man can fuck him up peak right bodily functions, but that's it
*  Right, you can't fuck with Iron Man with that bullshit ass set of skills. Yeah, you're just a really strong
*  But in the movie he's not in that movie he's way stronger than any person who's ever lived and he's also the leader like
*  He's the military strategy guy
*  He's the most sculpted. Yeah that face
*  Iron Man tells you who he is. Yeah, yeah billionaire playboy philanthropist
*  Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna go home
*  I'm gonna go Hulk or Thor those would be my two in a fight. Hmm interesting
*  I think Captain Marvel comes down fucks them all up. She's badass. They gave her too many powers
*  She almost has to give her everything except a good movie. That's true
*  They keep fucking her in the movie department. Yeah
*  Her movie was her movie was so like it filled the story
*  So you know who she was but it wasn't that great
*  You know and it didn't match up with someone who has the powers that she has like she look if you're playing a game
*  And the game is good guys versus the bad guys on your good guy side
*  You want to have like you'd be like real pumped if one person had way more power than anybody who's ever lived
*  That's her right or you would just you'd wait to play that card
*  Yeah, you know, you'd like let people know like don't let me have to pull Captain Marvel like don't don't have to wake her up
*  You're right. Are you because if she comes down here?
*  But here's the thing like they they can't figure out a way to make a good movie with that
*  I don't know. I mean again the movie was
*  Was alright, but it wasn't it wasn't great. It didn't show
*  She would have to have a boy. She is that's why I should have to have boy
*  Remember when Wonder Woman Wonder Woman had a boyfriend. Yeah, people liked it better. It's a regular soldier got to fuck Wonder Woman, right?
*  Remember and you know what? No one would believe you. Yeah, you'd have to shut up about that
*  Looking up Captain Marvel's powers and a little question popped up who is the strongest Marvel hero? Yeah, do you know the strongest I
*  will I would it would be be
*  Captain Marvel or so I thought it would be Thor a Hulk
*  It says also in the Destroyer which I've never heard of but it says Hercules and I didn't know her
*  Hercules was in there. Fuck
*  like a few
*  Comic books, but he's not Hercules
*  Hercules ain't considered part of the Marvel Universe, right?
*  Stan Lee didn't create Hercules exactly. Yeah, you're not allowed to do that
*  Like by the way, why would you have Hercules in a comic book? That's I do
*  I do vaguely remember Hercules being in some Marvel comics, but but now he did
*  I don't think he counts they didn't create him. You got lucky with Thor leave it at that
*  Yeah stole one god you can't steal any other mythical characters, right?
*  And and it was cool with Thor because in the comic books he was human too, right?
*  He had like a human form and then he would turn into Thor. Did he? Yeah in the comic books. He had a human form
*  I don't remember that but but you know, you would think that someone else could make a Thor movie
*  Like why can't they make a Thor movie like an origin movie about Thor the god?
*  Can you they might they might they have one's ever done that isn't that amazing done it yet?
*  But who knows they had some movies where people pretend they're in the clouds and they pretend they're they pretend they're
*  That you know, they're gods. There's been some god movies, right? Right? Well, the Brad Pitt one
*  Wasn't was there wasn't there Brad Pitt when they were the gods like Achilles or something like that
*  Wasn't there something I'm imagining this I believe there was a movie where a bunch of people Troy Troy
*  Yeah, and then they had those
*  What would they call Titans or something? There was like some they did a couple of movies where these guys were where they were gods
*  I think Liam Neeson was in it and they were like playing with humans humans were like their entertainment
*  Yes, yes
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, maybe was that clash of the Titans was they did a couple of those right there?
*  Yeah, the one that's from you know, like way way back in the day is hilarious to watch now
*  Oh anything with special effects from back in the day except, you know, you know what still holds up though Godzilla
*  It does like kind of fun old Godzilla movies like Godzilla was like he's still badass, you know
*  There was just something about Godzilla that it was that yeah, he holds up his old movies are good and the new Godzilla's good
*  Well, they figured out how to make those Godzilla movies. Like when we were doing stop-motion animation, they were like, hmm
*  Why don't you just have a dude in a Godzilla suit and then they just and then make everything else smaller
*  Yeah, they just had like a little New York or a little Tokyo and this dude in a Godzilla suit running around
*  It's actually for the time like really good special effects. Oh, yeah. Yeah that yeah Godzilla movies were great
*  Like that and he fought and they they would just come up with all these different monsters for him to fight. Yes
*  Giant moths and yeah
*  Gamera remember gamma camera that was the one that spun around that was like a turtle that spun around
*  Yeah, a spinning turtle that shot rays out of his legs
*  Yeah
*  You know what those were those were good drugs Joe
*  You can't get those drugs now where you just sit around and say man, what if we had a spinning turtle?
*  Those things would be on like Saturday afternoon, right? Yeah
*  Every week they would what was there was like destroy all monsters. It was some kind of
*  Yeah, oh this is this the old one
*  Yeah, wow that looks great
*  Yeah
*  Special effects actually pretty fucking good special effects
*  Especially I mean if you want to see a movie today that was like that you'd be mad
*  Well, you can't believe how right they made it look but back then this was awesome
*  Look at that. What I was like buildings. That's like in Jamie
*  They're miniatures and silly like but it's assumes in on this face and it
*  Looks awesome. It's like looking at the first Star Wars now
*  Like when you look at the first Star Wars now you're like, oh come on but back then it was like man
*  This is bad. I know it's terrible. Yeah, the first Star Wars is terrible
*  Like the special effects at least right it just looks so fake like even the Cantina scene where they went in there
*  Frozen open
*  Yeah, man, they did what they could back then. Yeah, I mean it's technology, right? Yeah
*  the other day they were doing all the Jurassic Park movies and
*  We were talking about when the first Jurassic Park like when the first dinosaur came out that was badass like it was like wow
*  That looks like a dinosaur, you know, and then they had like expressions. Yeah, and all of that, you know that that was
*  Yeah, the first Jurassic Park when those kids were in that truck
*  Yeah, and the T-rex comes over the top. Holy shit was that awesome?
*  One of the greatest scenes in any way he looks in the truck and he blinks yes, you know, yes
*  Yeah
*  Well when when they realized that the goat is missing that they had that goat tied up and they realized the goat is missing
*  And then they hear the you hear that
*  Although and you know, I hate to be this guy
*  But but we do it like you ever watch movies and just you like you you pull out the holes in the logic
*  Yes, what's the holes in the logic? The two kids would not be with the lawyer
*  Yeah, the little boy
*  Loved dinosaurs and he knew who the dinosaur scientist was he'd have been in that van true
*  He would no way the two kids would have been with the lawyer at least one of them would have been with a scientist
*  Yeah for sure. Were there parents in that movie? No, they were with their grandfather and was their grandfather the main scientist?
*  Yeah, no, the grandfather was the old guy who owned the plastic part, right? The old guy that looked like Colonel Sanders, right?
*  Yeah
*  So it's like if your grandfather created this park and he hired this scientist
*  You're like I'm hanging out with the side even though he didn't like kids
*  It'd be like my grandfather said that I can ride with you and Jeff Goldblum was the sexy scientist
*  Yeah, Goldblum was great in all of them. He was just that great character that yeah, you bought it
*  Yeah, especially the first one. Yeah, I love that dry faster. No must drive faster
*  Yeah, the first one when yeah, he had some great points
*  Yeah, about why'd you do this?
*  It's just like he you bought him right you bought his science his science made sense
*  Well, he's you could tell he's fucking smart as shit. Yeah, you know, so like when he's playing a guy who's smart as shit
*  You're like, all right. I'm not
*  Although that is one situation when a t-rex is chasing you
*  That's one of those situations where I don't have to be faster than a t-rex. I just got to be faster than you
*  Yeah, there's the goat leg falls down
*  Yeah, they're only on the dinosaurs only have a total of 14 minutes of screen time in this perfect
*  It's like a hundred. Well, that's like an American werewolf in London
*  One of the reasons why that movie's so good is you barely see the werewolf when you do see it
*  It's amazing, but you barely see it
*  Flashes you're terrified of it. I had a Rick Baker in here. He's the guy who did American werewolf
*  He actually did Star Wars too
*  And he's saying that that Katina scene that can'tina scene they did they threw that together on like a shoestring budget
*  He just put a bunch of mass he had laying around his studio and put him on people and dress people up and shit
*  but they when he did an American werewolf in London like they this was like
*  What a crazy operation where they had hands they had fake hands that stretched out they had like they would put
*  Like stop motion of like skin or hairs coming to the face the face would extend
*  There was that scene where his like his jaw. Yeah would yeah you I guess they had to do that
*  I forget how he said they did the hair. I forget how he said they did the hair that they do it in reverse
*  They pull it through or something
*  Like that one quick scene where you see it right I think that was the one thing you said it
*  I forget he explained how they did the hair where the hair was coming out of his skin his back and shit
*  I think it took a long ass time though
*  Yeah
*  But you only see the whole transition is pretty quick and then you only see the werewolf for like split seconds
*  You don't see it very often. That's great cuz you know when they're doing it
*  They're like we don't know how like in our mind
*  We see it
*  But we don't know how this is gonna work and then you have to like you were talking about the the artist who did it
*  He has to make that happen. So the directors like this is what I want and
*  Then you have to figure out how to make that happen. Yeah, so that when he sees it on film
*  He's like, yeah, but when you know if you nail it then it's amazing
*  Yeah, but if you do it wrong, then it's like I believe it's cheesy or you got to do it over again
*  But there's something about things you don't only see in the dark there it makes it better than like seeing it like
*  CGI obviously CGI really bright like that doesn't scare you like alien the movie alien scared the fuck out of you
*  You barely saw it you bet like most of the
*  imagination yeah, and and you're the and that's the thing with the script and everything else the
*  Anticipation of it or the awareness of it. But where is it?
*  Yeah versus a slasher movie where it's just I'm just coming through and chopping up people and or versus like the new Godzilla
*  Which although might be fun. It's like it's so clearly CGI
*  You don't have like a visceral react
*  like if you see a
*  werewolf in an alleyway if a guy drops his briefcase and looks up and he sees a werewolf in the alleyway for like a
*  Split second you like Jesus and then it's over like there's a scene in the American Werewolf in London where you literally see
*  the werewolf for
*  Fractions of a second it's one of the best scenes in the movie where there's a guy in the subway this businessman
*  And he sees it and you look at it. You're looking at it like the werewolf
*  Yeah, he's like oh my god
*  He starts running and you see this guy running away and he's freaking the fuck out and he can't he's almost having a heart attack
*  And he gets on the escalator and he drops his briefcase and and he looks down and just for a split second
*  You see the werewolves body move into frame and then it shuts off and that's the whole scene
*  It's one of the best scenes in the movie. It's one of the best scenes in the movie. It's everything's dark and mysterious
*  It's when you when you get real clear and it's obviously CGI doesn't scare you right?
*  We're also so jaded. Yeah, you know that we're so jaded now that
*  It's like after this how many movies that are gonna be about us
*  Quarantined something happened in the quarantine that is that you know, and it's
*  Yeah, it's
*  It takes more to scare people now exactly you got to be creative
*  It's a kind of it's a transition every point for us
*  And it's kind of interesting that the thing that caught on the quickest when it all went down was Tiger King
*  Oh, yeah that everybody was like
*  This is the perfect show for a fucked up quarantined world. I have two theories about Tiger King
*  It's like either you watch Tiger King and you feel better about yourself. You're just like man this guy that's fucked up
*  I'm not you know, thank God or you're watching Tiger King. You're like, yeah, that's about where we at
*  That's about where we are
*  Totally hate him. Well, you don't totally hate Joe exotic you get it. I get it. Yeah, you know you you I mean what he did
*  like he was
*  He was PT Barnum. Yes, he was PT but like he could have been PT Barnum if he if he
*  could have grown his idea, but but that that idea of
*  Just I'm just gonna keep bullshitting people and just reinventing myself and showing them this and and and people went for it
*  Yeah, you know, we just wants attention so bad. Yeah
*  That but that whole thing. Yeah, definitely a phenomenon
*  I would I would love to see like what people because it was worldwide what people in other countries
*  I would like to get their opinion of us of Tiger King because they've never seen you know, a lot of countries
*  They've never seen anything like that
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like in the United States like especially if you've traveled the Midwest or yeah
*  Or if you've been to one of those you ever go to like the low-budget circuses
*  You know that not the not the big ones, but the ones that like
*  carnivals carnival
*  Yeah, like we've seen that but people who have no idea of that
*  Be I will I wonder what their opinion would be there was one that was near my house and I took a picture of one of
*  the
*  One of the roller coaster rides they had set up. Yeah, and I put it on my Instagram page because it was this
*  Janky ass fucked up roller coaster that was on stacks of two by fours, right stacks
*  The guy operating it like he built it
*  I'm here with my friends and everybody look at that. Look at that shit
*  Yeah, look at those stacks that's to level it off, right? So that thing spins around in a circle while it's on these movable
*  stacks of wood
*  God forbid a fucking earthquake hits or something that thing's gonna go flipping sideways and flying off
*  I mean the fact they let them do that in a park that is crazy
*  Look at that and you just take your kid and you just throw them on there. Yeah, like go ahead kid
*  You'll be fine. What could go wrong? Nothing
*  Yeah, I mean nothing's going wrong right now and look at that one. That one's over. They did it. They did the ride
*  Come on. Yeah, and then you well, you know
*  It's like people were going there to the Tiger King thing and like yeah, I want my picture taken with a tiger
*  You know, it's all trusting you how quickly people got tired of Tiger King
*  Right now even that we're talking about it people are like still yeah
*  No, it's in and out like that, but that's that's about how something goes
*  Yeah, right and and the thing about it is when they were doing it
*  even when Netflix threw it out there cuz I saw it like the first weekend cuz in my news feed it came up and I
*  Was like what the hell is this and I started five minutes into it. I'm like, I got to see this, right?
*  so I just watched the whole thing but
*  Now that they had no idea it was gonna be that big a hit and now they're like, okay
*  What next you know, I mean like it's one of those things you couldn't predict Tiger King would be a hit
*  Oh, yeah, no way. So so you'd be weird the marketing or whatever people are like
*  What else what can you do? Those are the ones you can't create that no
*  They caught lightning in a bottle
*  It was a perfect time because it was they just happened to be there with the bottle right when the pandemic hit and it was like
*  What and then people just send text to their friends? You got a fucking watch this
*  Yeah, cuz everybody's at home looking for sure. Everybody's at home and it was like it wasn't a series. It wasn't part of
*  Something else it was like it stood alone as
*  Absolute insanity and and fascinating. Yeah, you know and it wasn't like a big marketing push
*  No
*  Because again once you once you watched it
*  I mean it you know the guy with no legs was the most reasonable guy on the show
*  He made the most sense
*  He seemed like a regular guy. Yeah that poor guy. Yeah caught up in the middle all that shit, right?
*  Whereas in any other circumstance you'd be like, how'd you lose your legs on that show? Didn't even come up like now
*  We're good. You're fine when the one dude is sitting there the guy that wants to be the campaign manager
*  He's sitting there talking to exotic Joe's boyfriend when he saw Joe boyfriend blows his brains out, right?
*  You're like what in the fuck is this?
*  You see the guy react. Oh my god
*  Like in the moment that'd be like you and me talking and one of us is playing with a gun and just
*  Blows yourself and blows your brains out. It's damn. Yeah, god damn people are crazy
*  but
*  Again, what else you gonna do? So so Tiger King?
*  Killed some time and then the aftermath of Tiger King killed some more time
*  But then we still got like six more weeks. So what do we do now?
*  I think we're supposed to be May 15th, right May 15th. That's the yeah
*  I think that's the latest projected date, but the governor just stopped people from going to the parks and beaches
*  Well, there was a new thing today. Yeah, I think you know, you know what it is
*  This is my theory like you we can't have nice things
*  You know whenever they give us something nice, we don't know, you know, like a little kid nice and they break it
*  So it's like okay, we're gonna let you go to the beach
*  It's like no you're not supposed to be playing volleyball and laying like like just you're supposed to keep moving, right?
*  You're supposed to like walk or ride a bike or go surf for this and it but you weren't supposed to just mingle
*  Gathering groups and of course we're gathering groups with party and they're like, alright, no, you can't you don't
*  Specific rules like you weren't allowed to stay put
*  Like you couldn't lean on things couldn't sit down right cuz you go walk around
*  I was riding I wrote I rode my motorcycle along PCH and you would see people
*  they parked their car along PCH right and they'd sit on the car and kind of like look at the beach and stuff like and
*  so I guess you each one of them had a
*  Car's distance between them because you're sitting on your car the next person sitting on their car
*  but then I passed this
*  Neptune's net which is like a big motorcycle hangout and
*  There were maybe 20 bikes in a row parked and the guys were all just kind of hanging out
*  And it was like no man like that. You can't do that
*  You know, I mean like like a motorcycles the ultimate social distancing vehicle, right?
*  You're you're by yourself. You're wearing a jacket gloves a helmet. You're not breathing on anybody
*  But when you stop you can't just all
*  Normal, you know and that that was the part that uh
*  That I think that that's where they're like, no, we're not gonna do it because I think you know this Georgia and Florida
*  Whatever. It's like they're like the experiment man. They're like, all right. Yeah, let's let them get out and then let's wait two weeks
*  And see what happens. Yeah, exactly. You know, it's exactly what it's like
*  It's um, it's a weird disease man
*  You know, I was just having a conversation about it earlier today
*  It's like it seems like it's more than one different thing
*  It seems like for some people it's nothing they shake it off some people even a lot of people more than half apparently
*  Asymptomatic. Yeah, they don't feel it at all. That's the scariest part, right?
*  Cuz you're asymptomatic and you're carrying it and then for some people is a death sentence and then and then I was most recently
*  I was reading about strokes
*  Yes, and about people having strokes like it's causing blood clots and yeah and this was something that they just realized like whoa
*  You know one doctor was apparently operating on this one guy who was a fairly young guy
*  What a stroke and he said you could see on the machine. I read that
*  Yeah, that new new clots were forming real time forming while he's doing it. Crazy. Yeah. Yeah
*  It's a fucking creepy disease and you know what and we were talking about this earlier. That's the doctor
*  Yeah, you know I mean like like yeah
*  Give me a guy who's so smart that he's working on blood clots and watching them form and explaining because
*  The part of problem the advice we get there's so many it's such a wide range
*  And like so if you're talking to me, I want to see doctor in front of your name
*  And I want to know you do so like like oh I work on the brains of people who have strokes like yeah
*  Tell me more you know
*  That's great people like going to car park that's great, you know a doctor you gotta stop saying your doctor I have a friend
*  He's an emergency room doctor
*  And like I'll listen to him like yes. Yeah. Yeah, okay
*  You're a neurologist you tell me what's going on because because he knows that he's getting all kind of information and he's on
*  Literally on the front line yes, and this and he was funny he said man they better not send me anyone who shot up bleach
*  He was like don't even waste my time
*  Someone was just funny the way he said cuz cuz he really is that guy
*  He's like the I'll save lives like he's a doctor. He cares
*  But on this and he's like man you better just don't even waste my time
*  When you heard about that you had to think this has got to be like a fucking movie
*  This has got it. This is almost like a movie. It's if it if it wasn't real
*  It would be hilarious
*  You know right and then the other thing is that the fact that like Lysol had to put out a thing like not for
*  Internal use like the idea that that they know there are people so dumb that they're like we better tell them not to do this
*  You thought about it
*  There was a thing that I tweeted I pulled it down when someone Tim pool one of my guests told me it was fake
*  they were saying that they got way more calls because of
*  Poisoning from Lysol and disinfectants after Trump said that but apparently the real truth is
*  There's way more people using that stuff around the house because they're scared and they're cleaning everything up
*  They've been coming in for a long time. It's not like it happened right after Trump said that it was actually happening right after the lockdown
*  Yeah, what I read it wasn't more people doing it, but they were calling to see like hey, what would happen if?
*  You know they were caught but but this one is weird, and I was just reading about this
*  There has been an increase in kids drinking hand sanitizer, and they told the hand sanitizer people
*  Stop making it smell good
*  Because kids you know it's like this sweet smelling and my only question is where the hell are the kids getting it because I can't find
*  Any I can where you getting this hand sanitizer you're drinking, but they said all kidding aside
*  They said because it's alcohol
*  It's like poisoning them someone was saying that if you get a hand someone saying they went to a supermarket
*  And they got hand sanitizer and smelled like tequila. Yeah, it has a sweet
*  Smell to it, but they said that stuff like it's probably mostly just alcohol right yeah
*  It's it's 70% alcohol one of my sponsors is making hands and Buffalo trace whiskey
*  They're they're they're donating cases cases of hand sanitizer. Yeah, because they can
*  Easily which over to make it yeah, yeah, really easy. Yes, just it's just alcohol that tastes like shit right
*  But kids are drinking it and that's just
*  Kid watch your kids don't drink that shit. What the fuck?
*  What our kids they're eating Tide Pods not a drinking hand sanitizer come on man
*  While we were growing up. There's definitely kids we went to school with that if Tide Pods existed
*  That's just kids
*  Kids do dumb shit. Yeah, you gotta watch dumb shit. Yeah, that's part of being
*  I don't know any better, but now it's like they do dumb shit, but it becomes a viral challenge
*  You know that that's a different like when we did it
*  Like there was one neighborhood kid
*  You know well, let's face it Joe you had a television show based on that one neighborhood
*  You had a show based based on the neighborhood kid who would yeah feed him this what the hell
*  I have a PhD in those people I understand those folks
*  Yeah, when we were growing up there was always a kid that would eat worms
*  I read a story about a kid who ate a slug on a dare in I think was Australia and you want to be in paralyzed
*  He got some sort of a viral infection because of this snail that
*  Paralyzed him then a couple couple years later. He died see if you can find that damn
*  That's crazy like but kids need to know this you can't just go eat a fucking slug right like they're real bad right you can't
*  Yeah, you you don't eat something
*  Some wild ass bug some snail or something
*  Even bring up this specific story. There's something called rat lungworm disease
*  Bring up the specific story because it's pretty crazy a kid on a dare ate a slug a man
*  I didn't say kid oh, this is a kid on a dare says on there now paralyzed. This is in New York though
*  It's probably more than one
*  Hawaiians with brain parasites oh Jesus poop eating
*  Slugs are giving you brain parasites Jesus fucking Christ there it is
*  Australian man who dared to swallow a slug has died after rare eight-year illness
*  I think he was a man when he died, but I think he was a kid when he pulled it off on a dare in 2010
*  Jesus Christ yeah, he ate a slug. Yeah, I think he was a kid that looks like a kid
*  He was in a coma for 420 days he emerged from the ordeal with significant brain injuries
*  But continued to live for another eight years, holy fuck he consumed a garden creature on a dare in 2010
*  My god
*  contracted in
*  encephalitis rat lungworm an
*  Infection usually found in rodents that can also be transmitted to snails and slugs if they eat rat feces
*  containing the parasites larva
*  See this is how
*  Again, this is how we get these crazy diseases for which we have no
*  Immune system defense like because you're not supposed to be eating slugs
*  That eat rat feces you know that's nature trying to say like what is wrong with this right?
*  I was eating slugs don't yeah
*  Yeah, there's things that gross you out for a reason they seem like
*  Bike roaches or rats they carry but they carry diseases you see me like I was sensitive
*  I don't know if this is true. I was in Jamaica
*  we were doing some tour and the guy said that if you if you
*  Like got lost or whatever you're on you said humans can eat what goats eat
*  He said watch the goats and if a goat eats it a human can be like if you know you're in the jungle
*  And it's just can I eat that plant?
*  And I was like all right that sounds I don't know if that's true, but it sounds like good advice sounds great
*  But I think goats can eat anything don't they like cans they show them, but they don't they don't actually eat them
*  I think that's I think that's a
*  But it's true that humans can eat there if that's true. That'd be amazing just bring goats with you whatever they write
*  You're good. Yeah, which which means get a goat now because I don't know which way society's going oh yeah
*  You need a goat now
*  To get a goat just in case yeah shit goes wrong you're like what are you doing?
*  I'm following my goat. You don't want a fully grown adult goat either you want a baby goat baby goat a kid
*  Well, yeah, they actually are kids literally
*  They get a battery out for eating tin cans. They're actually chewing on the metal to get the
*  Label and the glue on the label. They're not actually eating the metal what the fuck
*  Okay, so they're getting high on glue. They're into glue and paper so we can
*  eat what goats eat
*  Can humans eat what goats eat like if you get a baby goat
*  He'll know you're cool you bring in some you know you treat him well from the time
*  They're a baby like a dog like if you have a dog, and you've had him since he's a puppy
*  He knows you're cool like all his life. You've been cool, but that's also like that tiger king thing right like you raise a tiger from
*  When it's a baby yeah, but then one day it just realizes like I'm a tiger
*  You look delicious like you know I mean you can never
*  Alonzo you're a huge dude you fuck a goat up. I would think so you would fuck
*  Yeah, I think grab a hold of those horns like what you going bitch. Yeah, I think I could take you're gonna snap that thing's neck
*  Like a Steven Seagal movie not one of those big not one of big mountain goats that rams you with the horns though
*  Those can get like 300 pounds. Yeah, you don't want one of them
*  You want a domestic goat? What's the biggest? I wonder if I'm exaggerating? What's the biggest mountain goat?
*  What's the like a mountain goat or uh yeah?
*  With those white haired ones was enormous white
*  The horn last gun shit that can walk on like cliffs like they walk
*  You're like are you how do you live and they live their whole life? Well? That's why cuz they live their whole life doing it
*  How big it how big are those?
*  It's cuz the scoring size for some reason oh that must mean it's a hunting pig
*  Oh that must mean it's a hunting page
*  Did you ask how much they weigh?
*  Just ask how much how much of the biggest how much does a full-grown mountain goat way?
*  Adult females about 180 males average 280 yeah, so I'm up to 300 largest 385
*  385 and they're walking like a ballerina on the side of a cliff
*  Yeah, just dangling a little half-inch rammed by a 385 pound goat
*  That's gotta be like getting hit by a car like just
*  Look at the size of that fucker
*  Goddamn, they're huge. They look so cool. It looks like a horse fucked a goat doesn't it look at its face. It doesn't look like a goat
*  Now you know you know what that's like. That's like getting hit by an NFL lineman
*  Right now. It's like getting blindsided
*  Maybe even more NFL maybe even they might even even more power than that because they're on four legs
*  Animals right they're doing this all day long
*  You know there's a video of a ram
*  Slamming heads with a cow
*  The the ram starts walking towards these cows and this female cow gets pissed off and comes maybe a bull
*  I don't know if it's a bull or a female cow, but this cow comes forward watch this watch this. Oh, it is a bull
*  So watch this
*  It's not a bull seems like it right watch this boom you're out bitch
*  Wow, so the goat or the the the ram head butts that cow the cow do that one more time
*  Is it a bull it seems like a bull doesn't Jamie I?
*  Think it had horns. Let's see. Yeah, it's good
*  Yeah, okay, so it is a bull so that's why he's doing it too. Yeah look at his balls, too
*  You see his nuts his huge balls. How could I not see those?
*  But he gets K the fuck out he's probably dead
*  One more time well you know if he lived watch this one more time
*  Just look at the ram the rims like bitch. I'm scared of you
*  Yeah, so if he lived
*  Like that bull gets no respect for the rest of his life like yeah, so your bitch ass get knocked out by a ram
*  Ram probably one eighth your size you ain't scaring nobody
*  Yeah, they just know to do that move
*  I bet a cow I bet a bulls never experienced something getting in between its horns and hitting it flat on the top of the never
*  Or it's probably never experienced something stronger than it
*  You know
*  That seems like a scene in a movie. I did a doesn't seem right that a stick can just stop it
*  This just one's just stopping well. That's a little one. Yeah little that is and it's also
*  Probably a certain way. It's getting hit well. I think it hits objects, so that's what it is
*  It's dumb so as he puts a stick in front of it it headbutts the stick which means that like is it like if you're punching
*  something right and
*  There's a guy behind this thing
*  But you're trying to punch this thing here and this thing moves if you get to the guy behind it
*  You won't have any power the power be all in this one spot
*  And then it misses you just kind of like and also the animal doesn't know like this is something unusual
*  To him right why someone holding a stick out right so it just hits the stick with its head that actually makes sense
*  That's a good move
*  Maybe like like a bull with a cape right they make the cape look way bigger than the person's right bull just goes towards
*  The massive object right yeah, I was in
*  South Africa, and you know we did this Safari
*  It wasn't like the real Safari because we didn't have time, but they were like yeah by far the most dangerous animals a hippo
*  Oh, yeah, that's that that was the one date because when we went by the water you saw the backs of the hippos and they were like
*  Yeah, you don't want them to come out of there. Yeah, fuck that
*  Hippos are terrifying yeah, and they're mean they're huge they're mean
*  It's like basically it's like a tank and they're vegetarians, which is weird they're vegetarians, but if they feel a threat
*  Yeah, they grab you they drag they drown you they pull you under water
*  Because they can hold their breath for like five or six minutes or something like that
*  And they just hold you till you're dead, but Jesus Christ, but they say but they're like very territorial
*  Very me and they're fast. I think they run like 20 miles an hour or something like that like yeah, it's basically an
*  Armored living vehicle. I mean a living thing that there's a crazy video of a hippo chasing these people on a boat
*  Have you ever seen that one? Yeah
*  Or did you ever see like the lion that jumped on the hippo and then the hippo just stood there and then the lion
*  Jumped off. He was basically like I can't fuck with this thing
*  Well, there was one video where the lions trying to eat the hippo and it's biting into the hippos back
*  I think was taking a little pieces out of his back. I just couldn't figure out how to get rid of the lion
*  They're so big. Yeah, but I guess like if you want to survive in Africa around crocodiles
*  You have to be so big the crocodiles like I'm not even trying right, you know, right?
*  Yeah, there's so many things that can kill you that this is something that's like nap
*  You know what kills elephants sometimes in Africa ants
*  Yeah, they climb up into their ear, right? They just keep eating. They just climb all the way up their brain. Yeah
*  That's a hell of a way to go that's gotta be the worst and there's nothing you can do about it
*  What the fuck can you do?
*  Body eating your brain. That's a slow horrible death
*  Nature you cruel bitch. Yeah, but that's nature, you know
*  Nature's not to be fucked with there's a great video that I saw yesterday of a cat trying to get a squirrel
*  There's a squirrel and the squirrels on the tree and the cats on the tree and the cats going right
*  The squirrels going left and the cats going left the squirrels going right the squirrels successfully evading the cat for the most part
*  Well cats I think of
*  Domestic animals like they they have the most instincts of when they were wild like a cat can hunt
*  Yeah, you ever see him hunt a bird. Oh, yeah. It's like if a bird's dumb enough to land on the ground
*  Cats got him cats got him cats got it. They move so fast too, and they know you're gonna fly up
*  So they jump yeah, and then they swat you as you're trying to fly away
*  Yeah cats cats don't even bother eating them. No, they just kill it just to stay in practice
*  These dumb motherfuckers just leave it out for me like cats
*  Cats have trained humans
*  Perfectly cats are like listen I could but I have a human it will feed me and I can totally ignore it
*  Like like dogs earn their food
*  You know
*  I mean dogs like I protect the house or I fetch or I play with the kids and this or that cats like no
*  I will totally ignore this human and they will feed me. It's just such a weird
*  And what's weird is when people go deep with like I get when people have attacked dogs it makes sense
*  But I don't get the like servals and shit right and people have those weird like half
*  Yeah, like like there you don't want a cat that could kill you. Yeah, cuz it's sort of domestic
*  Those serval you heard of those things when they're trying to feed them like chicken bones. Yeah
*  Fuck man, that's in your house while you sleep. Do you have a dog? Yes. Yeah, but it's a golden retriever
*  Oh, it's nice though sweetest dog of all time
*  They're so nice everybody that comes over the house like if you came over my house, you'd be like
*  Friends everybody's a long-lost friend that has been something since since I've been just locked down
*  That thoughts crossed my mind like man should get a dog
*  I should dogs are great the only you go on the road as right as you do once I go back to work
*  I won't be able to take care of it. So
*  But but dogs are really cool and I have a neighbor who has a dog. It's called a dog. Oh, you're familiar
*  Doggo Argentino, yeah
*  Yeah, but it's a fantastic dog like and and she said she's a dog trainer
*  She said yeah, some people have used these for fighting and this and that she said
*  But if you get she's like I know a breeder
*  I'll get you a good one you can drink and it's really a great dog and it's tempting
*  But I know like once I go back on the road
*  Then it becomes the the it's either at the kennel all the time where I got to get the dog sitter
*  So it's not gonna work but dogs are just they're just cool man, I love dogs
*  Yeah, it would be sad for the dog, right? It's not fair to the dog to just leave it. Eliza's got it nailed
*  She gets them little dogs. She puts in a person takes them with takes them everywhere. She's figured it out
*  We were at the improv once and she's about to go on and she just handed me her dog
*  Yes
*  God that was an adorable dog. Yeah dogs very if you met tofu. No, I haven't met the new one
*  Oh super door hot Jeremy hot says one too. He's got a shack
*  Shack is his long hair chihuahua
*  That he brings. Yeah, if you're a road person a chihuahua is really like that kind of size dog. That's your move
*  Yeah, you just take him with you. Yeah, but oh man doesn't it make you not want to do the road again
*  Like when you I'm worried about that man. I'm worried about being home. I haven't been
*  It I haven't gone this long without getting on a plane in 20 years
*  yeah, and and the idea like I'm afraid of of
*  Not wanting to go back to work. The other thing is, you know, I've done a couple of live streams at the laugh Factory
*  Right. I'm doing next week. I'm doing a
*  Digital comedy club
*  Thing right. I'm like man. What if I get used to working without an audience? Well, what if that VR thing happens?
*  What if the VR thing happens and they can make it set up so that like you could be on a stage?
*  You put the VR on and the people put their VR on and they're sitting in an audience. I did one of those
*  It it was weird for now. Yeah, the the thing about it is what you really lose
*  There is an energy that comes from laughter in the room
*  Like you you can do it
*  I think of it as kind of like this or like doing radio where people can be listening and they might be laughing like like when
*  You do morning radio. Yes, they're laughing in their car, but you don't really know that right?
*  Yeah, the people in the studio have to kind of laugh along with you like everybody let everybody know right so I
*  Mean it works for now and and it is kind of fun and just odd doing it
*  You know, so I don't mind do like I hear some comics say that they wouldn't do it or they hate it to me
*  It's just like okay. This is what we're doing now and it's it's weird, but it's fun
*  That would be the question to ask those comics. What would you do if there was no more comedy ever again live?
*  What if this is just the tip of the disease iceberg right keeps getting worse and worse you you willing to accept no more comedy ever?
*  Probably not no no nobody would be you'd wind up doing those digital comedy clubs. Yeah, I mean I you know
*  I just hope it doesn't come to that. I don't think it's gonna come to that. Another thing is I was talking to a Vegas
*  Guy who's a promoter and does shows and he said he thinks comedy is gonna come back first
*  Because it's the easiest thing to produce so he said like you could do a comedy show outdoors with people sitting
*  Six feet apart from each other and just one comic with a microphone on stage
*  He said versus a band where now you got the the band members on stage and all the technical stuff
*  He's like comedies just this is where it's easy like we're a microphone and a speaker
*  That's a good point
*  So we could do it I mean you couldn't draw as many people
*  But what if you just test everybody?
*  Yeah, well, I think that that's gonna be part of it too. That's I was reading about as Europe reopens. That's what they're doing there they're
*  Scanning people like I guess testing you for fevers and I don't buy this thing that they want it
*  I mean, I don't want to do the tracking thing when they talk about that
*  I think that's a real slippery slope if they let you track people on their cell phones whether or not they're sick or healthy
*  And you you know exactly where they go and who they're in contact with
*  I think that's a slippery slope because the problem with that is once they get that kind of power to track people
*  They're never gonna get rid of it. They're never gonna get rid of it
*  They're gonna find another reason to you use it the user for the flu. They use it for something else and and it's also
*  So it's such a faulty
*  Thing to do, you know, you know, I mean like yes, it's like if you know, you're being tracked
*  Well, I'm gonna give my phone to whoever like what what do they always do in a movie?
*  They put the tracker on an animal or a car or something and they send them the wrong play
*  Well now they don't know who it now. I don't think they get a felony to do that Alonzo. You can't give your phone to your friend
*  Yeah, you were trying to be deceptive. Yeah, okay. I think you know, I just think it's a fucking slippery slope
*  I don't think we can I don't think you can trust them trust any
*  Authorities or medical or whatever with that? It's like that said what I was gonna say you can have a driver's license, right?
*  Well, why can't you have a license that shows you've been tested? Yeah, you don't need your face on it
*  It's a public, you know, like just like a driver's license, right? It's a seal
*  However often like once a year or something like that
*  You have like a hole punch next to the date an official hole punch
*  Like, you know, you get a bunch of them then you get a new card
*  Yeah, why can't we do that get a new card every 90 days until they come up with a vaccine. I think science
*  Science will come up with a vaccine, you know
*  combination of human immunity and
*  Science will come up with I mean it this is like polio
*  You know was when when you were a kid and polio was a definite threat like you had to worry about you know
*  And they came up with a vaccine right? This is another thing. I mean disease
*  I have a friend who who works in this and she said yet, you know viruses and diseases and stuff like they
*  They change they adapt so we have to adapt
*  Yeah, you know we we have to stay ahead of it and this one just caught everyone off guard. There was no
*  Yeah, they've been warning us about this kind of thing the possibility of this kind of thing for a long time
*  Bill Gates did a TED talk in 2015 where he talked about it. Yeah. Yeah, and you know, they they showed it I don't know
*  They looked at it, you know Obama talked about this is something we got to spend money on and get ready for and it's one
*  Of those things people didn't want to believe it. He's a guy who's
*  It's almost funny how smart he was like he just you know, he's like, yeah, we should prepare for infectious disease that nah
*  It's like now like oh shit, we probably should have prepared for infectious diseases
*  Yeah, and you know the United States but this is just another example of our medical system and we got to get it together
*  Where medicine isn't just for the rich? Yes for sure, dude. I hate to say this but I have to piss so bad
*  I drank way too much coffee before the show. Can we pause pause? Yeah pause it real?
*  Great feelings I fucked up. Sorry folks
*  I had a big thing of bone broth earlier and I had two double espressos
*  Then I had two at least two large bottles of water. Yeah, so it was a it was a real straw
*  I was like god damn and I fucked up. I pissed before the show too. I thought I was gonna be okay
*  So good. That's one of life's great feelings
*  When you when you got a pee and it's just right there and then you get that. Yeah exactly
*  It's a simple things Joe it's the simple things in the simple pleasure
*  That's what we can enjoy out of this pandemic some of the simple pleasures
*  You know what? I do appreciate I appreciate talking to people because I'm you know when you're locked up in your house
*  Most of the time you're until I'm here. I'm locked up in the house, right?
*  So I'm just sitting around or I'm in the yard or I'm going on we could go on trails in my neighborhood still
*  But at a certain point in time, you know, you want to talk to somebody so I come here
*  I appreciate talking to people like even more than before what what I like is the absolute silence at night
*  Like you know, it's I'll turn off everything, you know note like no TV no music nothing and just it's
*  Perfectly silent. It's so odd because so few people are out. So you just you don't get the car
*  They're like where I live you get a lot of cars or anything, but you just get nothing. It's perfectly silent and it's a strange
*  meditative
*  Situation like these are the kind of things that once we get back to once we find out whatever the new normal is
*  That's gonna be the kind of thing that that doesn't like
*  Yeah, we don't have you realize like my life isn't quiet. Yeah, you know, there's a lot of noise in life and
*  And travel, you know, we were talking about it. I don't know what that's gonna be
*  What is travel gonna be like
*  We're all gonna be paranoid
*  Yeah, are we gonna be trying to maintain distance what are the airlines gonna do
*  How are they gonna keep distance apart from each other and people already like oddly not connected when they travel, right?
*  Yeah, you sit next to a person you usually don't even talk to them
*  You know you get up everybody gets in line. You don't even really know very little small talk. Well, we're hurting it's hurting
*  You know since now are you still gonna be able to hurt people are people gonna appreciate?
*  You know, are we gonna be nicer to each other, you know, and and you would hope so
*  But human nature always shows like now we like when it seems whenever we're given the choice of okay
*  Can we be better or worse?
*  Why do we always go to worse? Well, this is this is why in this situation
*  You got to be worried because people really don't have any experience with this kind of adversity. So this is a new thing
*  So yeah adversity tests character. There's a lot of people that haven't had to develop character
*  They've been living these weak ass fucking useless silly lives, right? And then all of a sudden adversity comes and shines
*  It's like we had and these morons are all sudden dealt the weirdest hand of cards everywhere
*  Everybody's kind of fucked and then when things go back to work again
*  When you're asked to deal with adversity and you don't have any character, right? Like you like you're you're a guy with character
*  I think you'll be fine. I think you probably will be nicer after this. I know I'm gonna be nicer
*  Yeah, I think most people are gonna be like I don't even mean like nicer. I mean like a little more appreciative
*  I'm always nice appreciative appreciative and aware. Yeah aware of you know, one of the problem people are not aware of the
*  existence of other people
*  Yes, right
*  You know
*  So you have like like if you if you're holding a sign give me liberty or give me death in front of a Baskin
*  Robbins ice cream you're like you're not really aware
*  What that means are you like you're probably gonna be okay. There's a Baskin Robbins behind you
*  Your liberties probably not a life-and-death issue right now
*  The where awareness thing is a it's a real problem with people but there's people that are they're barely keeping it together with the most amazing
*  Society ever through no fault of their own for the most part
*  Most people were fucked up
*  They grew up in a fucked up house and they had fucked up family in a fucked up neighborhood
*  People did them wrong every step of the way and here they are all fucked up at 35 years old
*  But that doesn't take away from the fact that they are fucked up at 35 years old and if they are
*  Really overweight and they eat sugar all day and they can't keep a job and they're always making excuses
*  And now there's a pandemic don't expect them to rise the occasion right and or
*  You know that that's one the other ones are to we're so insulated
*  From reality yeah, you know like I briefly lived in suburbia right I had a house I was up in Valencia
*  Oh, that's a nice area. It's nice, but it's too nice. You know what I mean?
*  And it was like it was this perfect suburbia and and all I could think was man the majority of these people
*  They had their life goes from the cubicle to the cul-de-sac. Yep. That's their day
*  Yeah, I mean the cubicle at the office I come home to the cul-de-sac
*  And it's such a it's you know
*  I was always like I hope there's something in your life that makes this good because this would be the most boring existence
*  But that is what it's almost like that's what we aspire to like that's what they build every time they build one of these new
*  Communities right now they even the latest construction of malls
*  I used to always laugh about this so they tear down all the mom-and-pop stores and build a mall
*  Which is a fake town of mom-and-pop stores, you know, I mean like everything is this perfect controlled environment
*  Like you said now that's all out the window
*  So what do you do, you know and and what is gonna happen to people do? Yeah malls are well
*  They're already hurting the outdoor malls. Oh like REI that kind of shit. No, they like like oh
*  Outdoor like outside malls, right? Yeah, those might still work
*  But but even now they showed like still like Neiman Marcus about to go bankrupt because people like like wait a minute
*  You know what? I don't need clothes
*  Also people are buying shit online people are buying stuff online, but but a lot of stuff if you're like a like Macy's
*  You don't sell anything that people need right now. No, not if people are hurting right? Yeah
*  There's so so it makes it difficult to stay in business
*  When you don't sell when everything you sell is basically a luxury or a pleasure
*  Thing, you know like like diamonds, right? Yeah, nobody's buying diamonds
*  I haven't seen a cage Euler's commercial
*  You don't see any of those engagement commercials now, right? There's nothing
*  You know, it's so it's it is gonna be interesting because those companies have to survive this
*  Or don't then get us out. Look the
*  Blockbuster is gone, bro. Yeah, you know things change
*  Blockbuster was everywhere. I'm with us. It was was everywhere. There's one left date night
*  You know now these kids with their Netflix and chill back in the day. We had to earn it
*  We had to go to the blockbuster store and usually had to go with your girlfriend, right?
*  You can you couldn't just pick no no that they ran out. That's right. They ran out of the movies
*  They would have the empty box like we wouldn't see you wouldn't see Tiger King until it was your turn
*  Right cuz your blockbuster would have eight Tiger Kings and they'd always be rented when you went there, you know
*  Yeah, and whenever a new movie came out, they would always have a long shelf with the new
*  Yeah, a lot of versions of it and you had to rewind it. That's what
*  Made to only go to home movies came from
*  I knew a guy who made he made a ton of money on those
*  He made a man and I'm not talking porn. I'm talking regular movies. He said terrible movies
*  He said what he would do is he would get
*  the seniors in film school
*  Right, and he would give them. What did he say? He gave him?
*  something like
*  $10,000 in a camera and said go make a movie
*  And then he they it was either 10 grand or 50 grand was something like that
*  But he give him that in the camera go make a movie and they come back and he said and it always would be a slasher
*  Movie because they were the easiest to make and he said it's amazing
*  How many women will take their top off if you point a camera at him?
*  So it was all like titty slasher movies and he would sell them overseas, you know
*  It was you know, it was like bikers crazy kill or something at a mall
*  The mall monster and it was all these but but he made a he made a ton of money off of that
*  it was the straight to video movies with no budget and
*  The kids would make them and to the kid, you know, if you're a senior in film school
*  Yeah, that's a great thing when someone says here's some cash and a camera go make a movie feels to me the same way
*  I feel about like NCAA athletes not getting paid to play right when the schools are making billions of dollars
*  Huh
*  What's going you know, not quite as bad as that what's going on here?
*  How much money you making from this fucking movie man, but it's a great thing for the kids, too
*  So you're a kid and you're going to film school and some guy comes along goes not only am I gonna give you the equipment
*  I'm gonna give you
*  $50,000 to make a fucking movie, right?
*  Come on make a movie bro. You're gonna make a movie then he's gonna sell it for a couple of hundred grand or 250 or whatever
*  in the international video market, but
*  It's hilarious oh and and you talk about bad I mean these movies were just
*  But that's what made it fun is the movies were so bad
*  You know that it was it was like great like they we don't really have an editing budget, right?
*  No special effects. No. Yeah, is that guy holding a microphone in this shot? Well, you know
*  It's funny though occasionally some won't make a movie for like 15 bucks and it works like you remember Blair Witch project
*  Yeah, that was a fucking legitimately scary movie was a scary movie and and then they tried to
*  Do it big budget and they couldn't make it work. No, they fucked it had to be that, you know
*  They fucked it up the found footage. Like what is this? Right? Let's watch it like those videos
*  There was a whole show. There wasn't a series of movie called VHS
*  Wasn't there or VHS VHS VHS. That's right
*  Right, right, right
*  But VHS was a movie about people finding
*  VHS footage of like people getting attacked by demons and there was one that the lady they made a movie afterwards about her
*  I think was called siren
*  Where she was one of the characters in the VHS?
*  or VH
*  Yeah, VHS
*  She was one of the characters in that in one of it
*  There was a girl that was really pretty but really weird and these guys took her back to the house and she wanted to fuck
*  Them and she's like, I love you. I like you. I like you and she turns into a demon tears everybody apart
*  It was really wild. Yeah wild shit
*  But yeah
*  But do you remember part of marketing for Blair Witch that they had a bunch of online stuff that made it seem real
*  When it came out right there was like news news stories about people disappearing
*  Those are those people right now that are talking about 5g
*  Fucking 5g. This is a piece of it. It is coronavirus is a hoax
*  5g and it was created
*  Yeah, though when people say that like and now have you got this I'm sure you've gotten this people who were otherwise reasonable
*  Send you something and you're like, holy shit. Do you believe this like now? I got to rethink my relationship with you. Yeah
*  Like I got the one about don't take the vaccine because the vaccine is the sickness and
*  They're they're experimenting on you and they want to you know, it's like
*  Man, you you got a like you believe this
*  I got one from a smart dude that I know where they were
*  This doctor was talking straight to the camera and the doctor saying this is not a disease. This is radiation sickness
*  Doctor. Yeah a doctor. Yeah, well pointing but where's a doctor's outfit? I'm like
*  schizophrenia
*  Radiation disease they know exactly what it is. They've got it. They know the genome
*  They know that it came from the bats that came from the very area that the Wuhan lab was studying
*  Yeah, okay. This is really well documented shit
*  But people will absolutely ignore that that that's what's frustrating
*  to the scientists and the doctors right when they're standing there and and they're listen and they're like
*  We know this shit, you know, like like a friend of mine who's a doctor. He hates WebMD
*  Because patients come in and they already diagnosed I read on on the internet and he'll be like yeah cuz I went to school
*  Really funny cuz he'd like yeah, I went to school and I've been practicing medicine for 20 years
*  So I probably know more than your website, but if you want
*  Some people but some doctors suck though. Yeah, they were bad
*  That's the thing but
*  There's bad everything again being home
*  I've watched some network TV and I never really watched network TV, but now I'll just be watching whatever every commercial is
*  Either some drug right some drug for whatever condition you think you have or this or that or it's a thank you
*  To the people giving care during this time. It seems like that those are the only two
*  commercial that's why I say like if you watch too much TV
*  yeah, you're gonna start being scared to death and believe in conspiracies because
*  You're constantly pounded with this shit
*  Like you're just pounded with the the negativity the fear to take a drug for whatever you might feel or think you feel
*  Or whatever and then the drugs the side effects of the drugs and then now there's a drug
*  For the side effect of the drug that you took for something else, you know, I mean like like you
*  You have to take a break. You can't I don't think you can watch
*  Upper limit upper lip two hours of news a day
*  Any more than that?
*  Even that just give it that like I say, that's that's the extreme upper limit
*  I feel like I'm not watching much but I am checking in on news stories on my phone every now and again
*  Go to the Google I do my read I read the news because if I read the news I can control the amount and I can also
*  Get different sources
*  Different like or I read a story and then Google the story and see what other stories are about that
*  so like like when we were talking before about the thing about
*  People drinking Clorox and you're like, are they really drinking Clorox? And then you you Google it and you're like, oh no
*  Thank God, they're not drinking Clorox
*  Clorox and Lysol put out a warning saying don't do it
*  Well, if they had probably a couple of them would have tried it because and plus, you know
*  There was a lawyer somewhere like man, I'm ready to sue Clorox. You know, of course, of course
*  somebody's gonna get sued but
*  It's a it's a fucking weird time man. It's gonna be weird when everything starts back up how people behave. I'm hopeful
*  I'm hopeful for the best
*  But again, we're talking about there's gonna be the worst of us that are not gonna do well with this
*  Yes, they did on they're not prepared for any kind of adversity
*  So when this adversity comes out where we're all supposed to group up together some people are gonna act out
*  That's unfortunate, but I think it's gonna be less. I think more people gonna rise. They're gonna rise the occasion
*  Hopefully hopefully and and hope and this is where you you honestly you need good
*  Information. Yeah, you can't you know that you can't have the crazy information
*  And that you need good information
*  That has to be given to everybody. Yeah, like this this is what's real
*  Because there's always been crazy information, right?
*  There's always been a national inquirer and what was that other paper the national star the stars that's always been
*  But that but they never like like now you have people reading that like no, this is the real story and and you know
*  The New York Times is fake it's like no, I think you got that backwards now New York Times ain't perfect
*  But I think they're a little closer than the weekly world news
*  That's a real problem when someone like Trump whenever he gets challenged just calls everything fake news your fake news your fake news like
*  They get some things wrong. You're right
*  But if you just keep calling everything fake news, you're crying wolf, right? And the problem is then we don't know who to trust
*  So if someone just you're talking about the dangers of blindly believing the president's drink bleach
*  Well blindly believing the president that the Washington Post is always wrong or that CNN is always wrong or the New York Times is full of shit
*  That's not that's why it's not good. But then who's not it's not good because and yeah, there is you know
*  the news is politicized and there's left and right and this and that but
*  Papers like the Washington Post the New York Times the LA Times
*  They do a pretty good job and they've been doing it for a long time
*  And and if you if you read it, they've attacked both sides when things, you know
*  when when someone makes a mistake they call them out on it and this and that and
*  Yeah, you got it. If you lose trust of that
*  Then who do you trust now? Now's when the crazy comes in
*  When you when you start but again when you start believing the weekly world news and doubting the New York Times
*  What do you trust? Like what's your do you have a new source? I have a few the Times
*  In my news feed, I've got the New York Times. I got the LA Times
*  I read some of the BBC
*  like I like the BBC because
*  Looking at the United States from the outside looking in is kind of a different point of view
*  You know
*  What are the feeds do I get?
*  Daily Beast is is I like them
*  once in a while I get Huffington Post articles popping up and
*  And I read some
*  Some opinion pieces
*  You know again again there are there are some
*  I read this thing recently and it was really good. It was about the world being
*  disappointed and sad by the United States lack of leadership through this and
*  The article talked about like this is the first time in the past hundred years
*  Where something happened to the world and the United States didn't take the lead and it went back to talking about how we defeated
*  fascism and then democracy grew and the Cold War and
*  You know and and it said that and these were scientists from
*  France the UK
*  Germany, where was this article?
*  It was in the Times
*  It was in the New York Times and they talked like one of the the scientists was a climatologist from Germany
*  That studied at Columbia and they said, you know some of the best and brightest minds in the world
*  They were in the United States, but no one's listening to them and and they talked about how the United States again took the lead
*  Whenever something would happen to do to the world the United States would take the lead and say hey we got this
*  This is what we're gonna do. What do you think they could have done different?
*  And it talked about it in the article first thing
*  Was take it seriously and listen to the scientists
*  That was the first thing that the government could have done when a scientist spoke up and said hey, this is real
*  This is not some Chinese thing or this is real you listen to them and the second thing is give people real
*  Information say hey like you don't come out say this is a hoax and then say it's not a hoax
*  You they came out like they were because they were talking about Germany
*  Which I didn't notice that Markle is a physicist the Chancellor of Germany
*  So she right away went to science because she's a scientist, which I never knew
*  But they said but they told the German people like okay, this is real there's a threat
*  This is we you know
*  We don't know what to do, but we're gonna do something and I think had we done that had the United States done that in
*  January or in the latest February said this is a real threat
*  We have to take action and we're studying it where you know, basically you want to hear the government say we're on it
*  That that I think would have been a big difference because then just it was like 9-eleven right when 9-eleven happened
*  The entire country came together
*  We dropped our differences and said yo they attacked the United States of America, right?
*  And and now the actions afterwards later the war and all of that you may or may not have agreed with
*  But if you remember that for that first month man, we were all Americans, you know what I mean?
*  Like you we were sitting around
*  Talking and it was like this is the United States. So remember the flags on the cars. Yeah. Yeah, I mean we came together
*  London used to sell them
*  I believe it. I believe it. I love Jay. I love Jay
*  He is he's a character, but he's genuine and the biggest heart in the world the first TV show ever did I did with Jay London?
*  1993 or some shit. I'll tell you my favorite Jay London story from last comic in a minute because because
*  You know, we lived together in the house reality show we were there for about four or five weeks Wow
*  But but had they come out and said this is real
*  Where we don't know what it is, but scientists are working on it. And right now we need everybody to pause
*  That's what they need. Everybody needs to pause where you know, and and then
*  The other thing I think they needed to do from the beginning and this goes back to World War two
*  I there's a name for it. Whatever the Defense Act is where you call
*  You know General Motors and Boeing and I don't know 3m and whatever drug companies and say I drop what you're doing
*  We need you on this
*  Hmm cuz the United States like that was World War two, right when they said no, we're not making records
*  We're not making pantyhose. We're not making cars like you're gonna make tanks and you're gonna make
*  Bullets and you think that's the act he's using right now to try to force the meat companies meat packing companies to stay open
*  Yeah, but it's it's
*  It's piecemeal and it's too late like like if you do it. I think if it was done
*  from the beginning
*  It forget about the you're a Democratic governor and you're a Republican governor and you're reput like fuck all that
*  Like this is America like this is in times like this like you said what adversity shows character, right?
*  this is when the character of the nation and this is what this article was talking about where
*  The United States didn't do that where you had the federal government fighting against governors and they're arguing over who has
*  Constitutional power and stuff like this
*  Don't you think that there was a an adjusting period of people didn't think it was serious and then thought it was serious
*  How did you person didn't you personally go through a period where you weren't worried about it?
*  And then you became more worried about it as time went on right yeah definitely
*  But that's because of information because we weren't given
*  But you remember like information what the information we were getting in January wasn't that bad the World Health Organization
*  Tweeted World Health Organization tweeted that there's according to China
*  There's no worry of it being carried from person to person that was in January
*  It all happened in a weird way where there was
*  Conflicting information right and and people didn't but but once people knew that's why I said maybe by February right because in February people knew
*  Once February came around there was enough warnings that but try convincing everybody else there's so many naysayers out there right
*  But but again, this is where but if you have a unified voice if you have one voice
*  Coming out saying hey, this is what the scientists are saying
*  You know because because and I tweeted this a long time ago look I'm gonna get my information from scientists not from politicians
*  You know this is where the politicians need to
*  Step to the side on the podium like like what do they always do in the movie when the mayor stands up here and now
*  I'm gonna give it to the chief of police who's gonna tell you like yes, you need you needed
*  You know a president who's gonna say okay? This is the situation now
*  Here's the head of the you know infectious disease bureau or whatever
*  It was supposedly did we figure out what fucking happened with that pandemic?
*  Branch like remember there sit they said that he closed down that Trump closed down some
*  Lot of the people that have been taken off the team have been spread around different jobs
*  They they do respond to pandemic type things, but but there's not one specific
*  And the
*  Was whoops when they show the Obama speech because that's what came after the Ebola thing was when he said yeah, we need
*  He said this is like what did he say he said it's an investment
*  He said it's not an expense
*  It's an investment or insurance or something like that
*  But we need a department ready to deal with this because this is a real threat
*  Well now that they know now that there's I mean in our lifetime
*  Now that it has worldwide where the whole world is locked down
*  Everybody's got to step up in a big way with this
*  I mean this has to be as much of a priority as natural defense or
*  Immigration or health care or anything and this can put all of them to end if there's a real
*  Like really deadly disease right this disease is obviously not good. It's terrible, but this is a warning
*  This is a really a shot over the bow in comparison to a lot of diseases
*  And I think the other thing is and again, this is where you know when people talk about
*  I don't know government power and government this is it like this is when the government is supposed to operate
*  This is when the government's supposed to tell the medical world like alright. This is what you do. Yeah, we'll pay don't worry
*  We're gonna fucking pay you but right now if someone walks in sick
*  You lock them down and you you don't send them away because they don't have insurance and stuff
*  I mean we have you know that spreads more so much of that
*  Right our whole medical system based on what like it's always been frustrating to me when you go to a doctor their first question
*  Is what where's your insurance card not? How are you feeling not what's wrong and and it's the system
*  But but this was a case where they needed to say
*  All right, I'll put all that shit aside. You're gonna take care of patients
*  We're gonna isolate because what with the Ebola thing remember?
*  That son of bitch came like that one guy came from Africa or something and they like locked that
*  They were like no, man. You ain't going near anybody. You're gonna be in a ward sealed off
*  Nobody's coming near you who's not wearing full protection and they they stopped they they I don't know if stopped is the right word
*  but it's not as nearly as contagious, yeah, it's not as contagious, but
*  but there was a real worry seriously and
*  and the medical community
*  Has to like we need them now, you know what I mean, and we need them beyond
*  The government is the one who has to say this is what you'll do. We'll pay you for it
*  You know and we'll pay later and listen that that's what we do and people talk about you know
*  How much is it gonna cost and well right now that we got to deal with this, you know
*  No, nobody worried about the cost of winning World War two
*  They were like fuck let's win the war and then we'll figure it out
*  And then we turned out to make even more money afterwards, right?
*  And yeah, there's a military industrial complex that makes money and blah, but yeah, you can always find all of this negative shit
*  There's gonna be people who rip off contracts and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but
*  That's bad and it exists, but the government needed to step up. Our government didn't step up on this
*  They didn't give people real information. Like you said, we got different information from different people
*  You didn't know if it was a real or a hoax. You didn't know what to do
*  Well, there's a bunch of things going on here
*  But one thing it shows the need for something like what a lot of you like Bernie Sanders are calling for was
*  Have health care for everybody. Yes. Yeah, we need to have health care should be a basic right?
*  Just like a fire department is just and in a lot of ways I compare it to fires because like if your house catches on fire
*  No one does shit about it. Then it burns the house next door
*  Yeah
*  and that's same with
*  Pandemics if someone gets sick and we don't have a way to get them healthy quick and have a way to make sure that they
*  They have health care like they don't have to worry
*  Like that you could just go somewhere and you're not gonna be spreading this just go somewhere and they'll treat you and then you won't
*  Have it right and your mom won't have it. No one will have it like yeah, and you won't go bankrupt
*  They're not there yet. You know, you won't go bankrupt
*  I hope this wakes people up all these fucking guys who just want small government
*  Sometimes you need a lot of government you need like this is when you need a big government with power
*  Yeah, and this is this is what the government does
*  Example because unless you are in that category that you could afford a bunker in New Zealand those dudes. They're okay
*  About a Silicon Valley guy who had a bunker in New Zealand and he had a call to manufacture because you forgot his combinations
*  If you got a bunker in New Zealand money you're okay if you if you've got David Geffen's
*  $200 million yacht that's sailing. You know, you're probably alright, but but most then you got to worry about
*  pirates
*  You know if they know that you're locked in this the ground New Zealand
*  They just wait outside the the bunker hole
*  Although New Zealand is New Zealand's kind of got this wrapped up. They do they have no deaths now
*  There's like no new deaths, but you're like a thousand miles from Australia like New Zealand is definitely like hey you ain't getting in
*  New Zealand is amazing
*  I've never been but from what I've learned from people that go there all the time and my friends that actually live there
*  It's fucking beautiful. That's what I hear
*  I have a friend who runs motorcycle tours in New Zealand and I keep saying like yeah one year I'm gonna go
*  That's another thing that's gonna happen all the stuff we've been I'm gonna do one day
*  When when when when the world opens up we're gonna start doing that yeah, I think we're all gonna start doing that
*  Oh, I was gonna do this one day
*  We're gonna start doing so I hope a lot of people get out of dead-end jobs
*  Look when your job dissolves and you're forced to do something else, you know
*  There's a lot of people that got stuck in a situation in life and they were on momentum and now that moment is completely stopped
*  You get all that time to yourself all that time to reassess
*  Well, I had that thought like what would I do if there's no more stand-up I
*  Don't know I
*  Don't know bummer. It's a bummer of a thought but does that mean that because that's gotta mean there's no more restaurants, too
*  Yeah, I don't think it'll go away because you know I've had those interviews like what if the and comics tell the truth like we're the truth
*  Tellers we always have to do that in a podcast so we'll still be around I
*  Say we're gonna survive stand-ups gonna survive gonna take a while
*  How long to be different? I have no idea. Yes. You gotta bet if you bet a hundred bucks man
*  What when when does the comedy store open up again?
*  summer
*  Yeah, and like half capacity you think yeah people wear masks. Yeah, I don't know if they wear masks
*  Or we just have to sit a certain distance from each other
*  But I'm gonna I think again. I think they're experimenting now. I think these opening up
*  You know places in Georgia
*  If you had a guess I
*  Think it's too soon
*  Thanks, too soon
*  Yeah, especially the the other thing was because I was reading about New Zealand
*  And it's almost like they're doing the exact opposite like they said the places with personal contact the the hair nails
*  Massage whatever are gonna be the last places to open and I think that's the way that's what it should be
*  I mean that that's a very close contact
*  When someone's doing your hair or your nails someone sent me some shit from Germany where they have a line on the floor like a caution line
*  Yes, ladies are behind the line with like long sticks at the end of the sticks
*  There's a comb at the end of the stick. There's a hairdryer. I'm not bullshitting
*  Probably and and maybe that'll work but you know like like in Georgia like they're opening the tattoo
*  Part of like I don't think that that's an essential service you need right now
*  Well, I think you don't want the tattoo artists to go out of business the question
*  That no I get that from the
*  Who gets to decide I?
*  Think you do it well again. They're experimenting, but I think you do it in stages, right?
*  so so before you open the tattoo parlors, maybe we go to
*  Restaurants and sit at eat every other table. Mm-hmm and see
*  But I don't think it's a bad idea for the tattoo artist either because you can decide to let someone in the business
*  Right and make them wear a mask and keep them away from you
*  I mean if you can get people tested if you can go to a tattoo artist and say hey, here's my test
*  I got it yesterday. Here's the results. Why is that so hard?
*  Like we need to have like some sort of a document that you can care. Where are you?
*  Alonzo, no, you're right. And this is easy papers
*  This was another one of that, you know best and brightest and come together right the the companies
*  The science companies like the government should be like, alright drop whatever you're doing like we don't need more Viagra
*  We need a test for for kovat
*  You know, I mean like develop something so we can take because testing is a thing you you got to test people
*  People are locked up in their houses. They're not gonna stop making Viagra
*  Nine months from now, there's gonna be a overpopulation bump like the world's never seen before
*  We're gonna go from we're gonna replace everyone who died
*  That's gonna be the big pandemic the big pandemic is we're running out of delivery room doctors
*  There's not enough. There's not enough doctors to deal with all these people shitting out kids
*  Man that well good that would be that would be a positive that's a positive maybe but yeah
*  Well, yeah, and what you said is true. Listen, I'm not anti tattoo artists by any means. I got him
*  I get it, but I was just using that I get it
*  Shouldn't be the most important thing to be open food stores obviously stayed open during this entire time
*  They're the most important thing gas stations. That's important
*  But at a certain point in time, we we have to figure out like what is the threshold?
*  should should we
*  Quarantine old people and sick people from here out and should we let regular people go free and should we make testing more readily available?
*  Those are the things like make testing way more available and leave it up to people to make their own decisions at a certain point
*  In time, you can't just keep people locked up
*  No, you can't keep them locked up because we're getting we're getting the fever here in L in LA, right?
*  We were fine being locked up for those couple of weeks when it was 60 and raining
*  Yeah, but when it hit 85 and the Sun is out and we don't have to go to work
*  And you can't even go to the beach. Yes like oh you now is when you can't keep people locked up
*  And it's a late spring in a lot of the country
*  But as as the weather gets warmer and people getting on each other's nerves in the house
*  Like that's when you got to let you know
*  So yeah testing is the big thing and just what you said if there's somehow you get tested and then you have proof like yeah
*  I've been tested. I'm okay
*  Then you're you're like, okay now you can
*  Function you can you can like if you're running a business if you're running the nail salon or the tattoo place or whatever
*  You know like like George Wallace tweeted this thing about bowling. He's like don't everybody share shoes
*  In Georgia bowling alleys are on list so you you know, you got it before you get your bowling shoes
*  You got to show them your test card
*  That's
*  That's gonna be it and and and and it is also a function of where you are
*  Right, obviously New York where the population density is just
*  Unbelievable it spread more and you got to be more careful here in LA pollution air pollution people who smoke
*  There's a lot of factors obesity a lot of actors
*  We're in our cars in LA so much that we don't interact as much as you know, New York
*  And then if you're in, you know, Iowa or Oklahoma one of those plays someplace where the population is more spread out
*  Then it is gonna be easier because you're just naturally you don't
*  encounter people as much
*  Yeah, like if you have a small town like there's a case going on with a small town in Northern California
*  where they don't have any cases and
*  They just want to open up and like can't we just
*  Keep going to the town. Can't we have restaurants if no one's sick?
*  Like when like as long as new people don't come into this town this town is clean
*  Yeah, but then how do you stop that how do you know, how do you see if you have restaurants?
*  How do you stop the people from San Francisco dirty outsiders from driving up to your restaurant dirty outsiders?
*  There you go. You can't because as soon as people find out that all that that counties opened up and they've got restaurants back there
*  Well, like the beaches right the LA beaches are closed, but Orange County and Ventura beaches are open
*  No, the governor's come close. Well, he's closed those but when they were open LA people just went to those I
*  Was so torn on that on one thing like yeah
*  What if those people do get people sick?
*  But the other part is man if you're stuck in a fucking apartment
*  Like the only happiness that you've gotten out of all this is when you got to go to the beach. Yeah now that's gone, right?
*  Yeah, it's a it's a tough line
*  You got to let people out and when people go out they got to behave right so when what's the number?
*  President Alonzo, what should we do?
*  Everyone we keep the lockdown until May 15th
*  May 15th we we've the Comedy Store. It's essential business
*  May 15th, we reassess we assess
*  Where are we at? Are there still an increased number of in of people getting infected?
*  Has it stabilized right and what does it look like in Georgia? And what is like in Texas long as we got them?
*  What is Florida? Let's see what they do. You can't count, Florida
*  You
*  Can't count I got friends. I love people in Florida, but sorry Florida. We're just gonna have to yes. We can't count you
*  That's Florida
*  It's just no it's a alternate reality that's an alternate reality
*  Even when you're in Florida
*  There's two Florida's right because there's coastal Florida that's Florida they tell us about which is Miami
*  Fort Lauderdale Orlando Tampa, then there's that
*  Then there's that middle of Florida. Yeah, don't talk
*  Where they made that Leonard Skinner music what Jim that order from this the governor I was saw going around last night
*  It was an order that was sent as it was going around as a memo that was sent to sheriff's office as I'm reading right
*  Now it's not an official order
*  So why all these stores? God damn it's a recommendation sites. Yeah
*  Sites were saying the governor said he's closing down all the beaches. So what is it?
*  We're gonna pull the story up. Sorry. Previous reports say they were conversations that they were having maybe he panicked
*  No, I want every who rehired
*  previous reports for Newsom's orders indicated he planned to close all the state's beaches which
*  Drew widespread criticism from some state officials when asked what changed his mind on closing state bid
*  beaches bitches
*  Newsom said that they never did and this is exactly the conversations we were having
*  So they never did close all the beaches. What is this?
*  Officials in other parts of California spoken out against a blanket beach ban in California sheriff William Han so overseas Humboldt County, Holla
*  In the northern part of the state where they get high as well said he strongly
*  Opposes the order and indicated in a tweet that he would not enforce it if an order is issued
*  I believe violates our constitutional rights. I will not enforce it good for you sheriff. Yeah only
*  I was you want to get sick. I wish you hadn't said it that way
*  He's right though. He's right. It does violate your constitutional rights, but then the proxy the problem with that is
*  That that brings out the crazies right the angry
*  I bet he's responded look at new Newsom's actually reacting this said is of his office received letters regarding the beach closures
*  But said that his decision is guided on what local health officials think is appropriate and what's not when you pull back too quickly
*  You literally put people's lives at risk people are literally dying because I don't like when a governor uses literally twice like that
*  I'm a stickler for some some sort of grammar because the decisions that were done without a real frame of focus on public health first
*  Newsom said that's what ultimately guide our decisions
*  That's good
*  But you you got to also give people freedom and you got to give them the opportunity if they don't want to go to the beach
*  Like there should be a way you can avoid go if everybody's still every everybody else is still locked down
*  How much does it really spread if people go to the beach and then come home? Well, this is the thing and this is where
*  Common sense like I get the constitutionality of it
*  But when you say that that angers people that word angers people
*  So you use common sense and and I get what the sheriff's saying like if you're in Humboldt County at a small beach
*  That's not the same as opening Santa Monica, right? So so you look at individually
*  Where are you at? What's the population?
*  Who's going to the beach and you that's why yeah, you leave it up more
*  It's more of a local decision because California the coastline is so big and so long
*  There are some places where it's gonna be packed and other places where it's not and the places where it's not gonna be so
*  Packed let them open those places are weird those places
*  Yeah, eat it a bed and breakfast
*  The people run the place are odd but let them let them open but you can't open, you know Venice
*  Yes, because that's just gonna be too dangerous and and that's where and and that's why when I say the constitutional work
*  Cuz once you say constitutional then you bring out these people that want to make it a protest
*  I want to make it a thing and these are people who don't even care about going to the beach
*  They just want to make it a thing. It's like don't don't fuel that fire
*  Right, right, right. Don't don't throw logs
*  Want a ranch on public land for free and they brought guns and try to keep the feds away from their cows
*  Like like the guns like that was the thing right when they first said guns are not essential
*  Right, then they pulled back on that
*  Well, it was essential and then they decided to stop it from being right central because there's giant lines outside a gun store
*  Yeah, people kind of tweaking and then people complained about that and then they stepped in and said it's not and everybody said fuck you
*  And then they go okay, we're kidding you could have your guns
*  So let me tell you cuz cuz I had I directly experienced this last week. I bought a gun
*  About the last first time you've ever owned a gun. No, no, I owned a gun back in the 80s
*  I used to target shoot with some guys I worked with
*  up in Oakland, but I
*  Bought a gun right because all of this went down and people like why'd you buy a gun?
*  I said because the purge went from a movie to a documentary
*  I don't want to be the only one, you know, but but the way I had to do it was you go online
*  And you make an appointment with the gun store and then you show up and you wait outside like they come which by
*  I bought a Glock
*  45
*  Stepping up. Yeah
*  So I checked with the gangbangers. They were like, yeah, this is the one you hold sideways
*  But but anyway you had to wait outside, you know six feet apart or whatever and they brought you in one at a time and
*  And then I was able to do it I did the background check by the way the people who fight against the
*  test in the background check like
*  How like you understand how have you done it? Do you know how easy these questions are?
*  They're very easy this questions on they're like, are you a felon?
*  Yes, are you you know, is there currently a restraining order out against you like well who who would check?
*  Yes on that box
*  Well, you have to
*  You're lying you'll never get it right? Well, I you know, I'm pretty confident that I'll pass and I'll get it and
*  And the guy was cool. This is this was one of my concerns was I was because I don't you know
*  I don't know what gun store to go to right? So so I was so I said man
*  Don't let me walk into someplace where there's a big Confederate flag on the wall
*  In LA
*  In LA in LA County. Yeah, you can find yet. Well, listen listen Joe trust me on this. Trust me on this
*  They're out there. But anyway, no the guy was really cool country off the five
*  Yeah, and the funny thing was the one of the big things was the size of my hands, right?
*  So I have big hands
*  So he's kind of like yeah, man
*  You got to try to literally try it on and see how it fits and the Glock fit my hand
*  Really well and then I was asking about shotguns and he was like tell him because I've fired shotguns
*  I've done that skeet shoot and stuff and he was talking to me about tactical
*  Shotguns and so so he said yeah, you want to get he said you probably want one of these because you don't really have to aim
*  Too well when you got one of these you just blast in the direction. I was like, alright, that sounds good
*  so I'm probably gonna get one of those two but
*  Yeah, but it was cool and and you know, I get it like I'm you know
*  It's funny because people say that people have accused me of being anti-gun and I'm like, no, I'm not anti-gun. I'm pro-common sense
*  I'm pro-common sense. But what were your thoughts on gun laws before this? Did you think that people don't need to have guns?
*  No, I never thought people don't need to think you did because I've talked about like we we don't need 50 round clips
*  You know, I had a joke. I said listen, I got a 50 round clip for self-defense
*  If 50 people want to kill you at the same time, maybe it's you
*  Perhaps there's some part of your personality you need to look at I'll tell you one thing. I've always got about guns
*  I'm a motorcycle guy. I'm a car guy and I know some gun people and from the mechanical
*  Artistic point like this is you know what I mean? Yeah, I get that like yeah
*  Yeah, there are guns that are beautiful just from a mechanical standpoint
*  You look like this is a beautiful thing and and if you want to shoot it and shoot targets and this and that that
*  Great if you want to hunt like you hunt I called you you remember I texted you why I said Joe if this shit goes down
*  I'm coming to your bunker cuz I know you know how to kill animals like I got a friend who knows how to kill animals
*  I'm gonna go hang out with him
*  Earlier today someone was asked me if would you be okay?
*  And I'm like you probably would not be okay with no civilization because you'd break an ankle and you die you you get
*  An infection and you die and good luck finding animals all the time
*  And what if you run out of arrows or what if you run out of bullets you can't make your own bullets
*  What if you get real weird real quick, but but all of that aside?
*  But those are the people who I'm like those are the ones we need to watch the ones who like I gotta have this whole
*  Yeah bunker full of ammo and this and that
*  Thousand guns the government's coming to get me and all that like those are the ones so when I talk about gun laws and rid
*  That's why I say common sense. There's a common sense level to it. You know that that I'm okay with
*  But but no I'm not anti. I'm not anti gun
*  I mean you can't the thing about people is they think it's a slippery slope
*  So if you say I am for the Second Amendment
*  But I don't think you should have 50 round clips or I don't think you step then they like well who gets inside
*  Who again
*  Common-sense comments, you know, you know who should decide should be the majority
*  It should be people but but again, this is where
*  We're all one side or the other and common sense is in the middle
*  If we had a government a Congress whatever that could debate and talk about and have input and say hey
*  The hunters say that we need this and and you know now it all makes sense
*  Then you come up with it with a reasonable gun thing like for instance. I
*  Think that cars are a good example like we regulated guns away
*  We regulate cars in a sense you have to have a license and when you sell it even privately if I sell my car to you
*  I notify the government like hey, I just sold my car to Joe
*  Then number blah blah blah. He's now responsible for it, you know
*  Hold right there for a second cuz someone just I need to find out if this is true
*  Someone just told me that in Georgia, they're gonna let kids have drivers license down
*  That's a hundred percent true that you don't have to go through a driver's test now
*  Like the
*  Last step of the like going to the DMV. We put an article on that so I could read what the parameters are
*  That is terrible. Yeah. Well, do you remember how bad you were a driver when you first started?
*  You know what again Joe when they do this, I'm like, yeah, why the hell not why the hell not?
*  Road test requirement for drivers license during coronavirus Wow, right because why would you need a road test to drive a car?
*  The state the state government will rely on the honor system with parents giving young drivers the okay to obtain a license in fucking Georgia
*  Jesus Christ
*  Joe once again once again
*  Common sense see now that you saw that and your common sense meter went. Oh hell
*  You know, it's reckless. They're letting people go to barbershops to letting people get a license with no test
*  You know, Georgia's right next to Florida
*  Just saying
*  But I would think of no offense Florida, but I would think of Georgia above floor
*  I think Atlanta above any city that is in Florida. No offense, Florida
*  But I'm gonna be Miami's a party city all the rest of them
*  There's not there's not a city that has the kind of sophistication that Atlanta has right?
*  But Atlanta is an island within Georgia. Yes
*  You know
*  Atlantis like an island. I know so we look at Georgia we think oh, yeah Atlanta
*  I've watched that Real Housewives show you right the rest of Georgia the rest of Georgia. This is you know, there's a lot of
*  You know, it's like California, right?
*  Everyone thinks of LA and San Francisco, but there's a lot of California in between LA and San Francisco
*  Yes, that is different like humble
*  Yeah, the guy that's gonna write sir violate any constitutional rights and he's not gonna enforce it
*  Yeah, it's um
*  California on the way up to San Francisco when you take that five. That's what I was talking about
*  Yeah, that's farm country with anti-abortion billboards. That's right. Yeah, and the whole water thing
*  They're fighting against the cities for the water
*  Water rights. Yeah, there's a lot going on, you know, so so yeah, I think that
*  Again, if it worked if the system worked we'd have a system of common sense
*  Unfortunately, we just have one extreme or the other did the thing about no guns
*  It's like what are you gonna just there's already millions of guns out there so that that's impossible like that's an unreasonable
*  It is one of those conversations doesn't have an answer. It's not a clean answer
*  So when people bring that up, they go well Australia did it like okay
*  First of all a there's only 20 million people in the whole fucking continent and it's a size that contiguous United States
*  So there's more people in California than there is in Australia. So shut the fuck up
*  Yeah, and and they also did it over a period of time
*  And they did it at it they did it in a moment of outrage
*  They did it in a moment of outrage and and unfortunately used us as an example
*  Yeah, you can still get guns over there for hunting though. Yeah hunt with guns over there
*  Well, it's not easy people who hunt in Canada, you know in Canada had a mass shooting
*  Not too long ago. Yeah. Yeah, but
*  So, uh, you know, yeah, like you said it's one of those without an answer
*  That's the problem if you definitively think that this is the way and
*  You don't see the other side of it
*  Then you're gonna always have this polarized argument, right?
*  And if people wouldn't would lose that if they'd lose the I have to win
*  Right and just like let's come up with a compromise that works
*  But the gun people like particularly NRA people they don't think you should give up any ground because if you give up any ground
*  From where we are right now, it's just a slippery slope
*  Keep taking and they do have a point with some people now a lot of those people that used to think like that now
*  Are buying guns hilarious
*  Buddy mine's wife was you're never having a gun. You never have any gun this shit went down
*  You need to get a gun like he said this it was a 180 switch and it happened immediately when everything was shutting down
*  Yeah, you start thinking of people in their worst-case
*  Possibility rather than oh we live in a nice area, right? We're fine
*  Yeah, and and again
*  You're right. Either extreme is is impossible
*  Neither one wants to give up an inch and you both have to give up an inch, you know
*  Neither one wants to give an inch but you both have to give an inch and you know
*  And again, this is what we were talking about earlier where the federal government the federal government does need to be involved in a sense
*  Where you have like Chicago?
*  That has a huge gun problem partly because you can just drive over to Indiana and buy anything you want and bring it to Chicago
*  Is that what the problem is? Yeah, how close is Indiana to Chicago Gary, Indiana to Chicago?
*  I think it's like two three hour drive. Oh, and that's where guns come from when I grew up in I grew up in New York
*  City, right New York City has
*  Some of if not these strictest gun laws in the country. I
*  Knew guys say you go down south you go to Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina
*  By any gun you want drive up and sell them in New York
*  Because remember we are borders, you know, there's no border between states you drive
*  I hope that stays the way it is
*  I know that's a terrible thing that people are bringing guns from Virginia
*  But I hope the border thing stays the same if you want to drive across the country. You can just go
*  yeah, I think the border should stay the same, but I think there has to be some sort of
*  Federal oversight to this so what?
*  there
*  Again what what you can buy what's required to buy it what's required if you had to provide ID
*  To show who you are and where you live. So now if you're in by a gun, you mean? Yeah
*  You should have more than that. You should definitely do that too, though
*  But that's what I'm saying. So now if you're in one of the more
*  Lack states like Virginia and I'm just using these example. I don't know specific laws but a Virginia or Arizona or something like that
*  You know, you can't just go there you live in California
*  Live in New York and go there and buy one like you got to prove like yeah, I live in Arizona
*  So I can buy the so I'm subject to Arizona's laws
*  Yeah, how does that work? If you're a citizen of the United States and you drive to Arizona?
*  Can you just buy a gun like you live in Arizona from what I understand and listen? I'm far from an expert
*  I know there's probably Google this but but the gun shows I think that's where they said you have a lot of
*  Fuckery in the gun shows because the gun shows is just one guy one person selling to another and that's where it gets really vague
*  Yeah, that's what the rules people buy all kinds of illegal shit, right?
*  So I think you you know, I think in a gun store you need to provide ID and stuff like that
*  But the gun shows yeah, it gets really kind of a gray area
*  Didn't Bruno from didn't Sasha Baron Cohen is Bruno character go to a gun show. Yeah, I think
*  Yeah
*  Yeah guns are fun. The problem is people are morons
*  It's not the problem is not that guns aren't fun. You know, I get yeah, I like guns
*  I have friends who are really gun nuts, you know, I friends that have so many guns
*  They don't know how many guns they have they love guns and they love them for the mechanical thing
*  It's their hobby like some people really in the muscle cars some people
*  I'm absolutely cool with that because most of the people I knew one guy who he was one like I'd be worried about
*  You know, he was one like
*  Yeah, this guy's waiting for a reason
*  I have a friend who's a gun nut and he got carjacked and he shot a guy and killed him
*  But most of the gun guys I knew they collected him. Like you said, it was like muscle cars or motorcycles
*  Yeah, whatever. It was just their thing. Yeah, and and they were good with and the other thing is the gun safety
*  You know these idiots like there's so many stories like yeah
*  The gun was in the backseat and the kids shot the other kid and it's like come on did there has to be some kind of
*  Safety and liability issue
*  You know you'd like what's morons just what it is. Yeah, you you never do that. I would never do that
*  Right. It's the problem is you're taking something with godlike powers and you give it to moron
*  Yeah, and then they have so there has to be that you have to somehow you're too dumb for a gun regulate the moron
*  Yeah
*  You know man, we've talked to a few people and yeah
*  No, it shouldn't be just are you a felon? It should be like a competency test, right?
*  You know, I mean you need a competency test to drive a car because the car could be deadly
*  Well, no, you don't need no, you don't you just need to go to Georgia
*  They're probably taking so much heat for that right now people are probably freaking out then again, maybe not cuz it's Georgia
*  Yeah
*  And again where where are you so if you're way out on a farm in Georgia and you want to drive the pickup truck
*  Then that's probably okay
*  But exactly, but if you're in downtown Atlanta, right at 16 and your parents are like, yeah, you can have a license
*  What the hell? Oh my god
*  Blinkers you're gonna be in a panic
*  That's a Larry and it's so true, but it's so it's such a poorly fucking thought-out idea
*  Yeah, who who who decided that who decided that you know, you know, yes screw the
*  Screw the road test. What was it was the governor of Alabama that we didn't want to shut down. She goes we're not California
*  Yeah, was that what it was? Yeah. It's like no, you're not we're not California
*  Craziest place in Alabama. Have you been to Huntsville? I've been to Dothan
*  Dothan Alabama I did a UFC there in 1997 first UFC ever did. Oh, okay
*  I've been to a couple different places in Alabama. Well, here's the thing Huntsville, Alabama
*  rocket scientists
*  It's where NASA is when I drove in there's a Saturn five rocket. Holy shit
*  It's the last thing you're like this is Alabama
*  Literally, they are rocket scientists. They must be some of the smartest people
*  But it's the last is in the local it's it that's exactly it
*  It's the last thing you would expect it blew my mind. They blew I mean that yeah the US Army
*  These are literally some of the smartest people in the country in the world. Yeah
*  In Huntsville, Alabama, but they have good food there though. Yeah, they had all kind of good food
*  But you know what the southern people know how to eat. It was one of those things that you're like, man
*  This is this is insane. It's just weird like you didn't think I didn't expect it there
*  Isn't that funny when you think about that that people have been cooking over fire forever, but southern people were like, hold on
*  Slow it down a little let's slow it down a little you know, I'll cook that motherfucker
*  You know, I know cuz they're not worried about it being healthy that too, you know, oh, yeah the sauces and
*  Hey, they figured out I want some I want some chicken fried chicken
*  With a cream sauce
*  When it's done right man
*  You know, but then but then they take it too far right now. We're deep-frying Twinkies. You're like, okay stop
*  This is so your heart just stops
*  Yeah, but chicken fried steak when done right with that gravy and some mashed potatoes like I remember one time we did a show
*  In Georgia at the club was the club there was it the funny bone punchline punchline Atlanta
*  We did we did that club and then afterwards we went to this local diner that had chicken fried steak
*  And I was like, oh my god. Yeah, it was so fucking good. They know how to make food
*  You know, and you say you get some sweet potatoes and this or that and then you know
*  Some cobbler for dessert and like it but nobody's counting calories nobody's
*  Think the people that probably earned the right to make that food back in the day
*  We're probably working some crazy hours
*  You do physical labor all day like who fucking invented all those foods
*  Like who who was the first guy to look at a barrel and look at another?
*  I need a barrel where I cook on and then I'm another one next to it
*  So the smokes coming in the side slowly cook this fucker. Somebody did it by accident
*  And then they were like man that was good or maybe they just like like cook something like they go
*  Oh, I need to cook this like I don't have I don't want to cook it right now
*  I'm gonna like just kind of put a little bit of maybe I put a little bit of a fire and just let it sit for
*  A while. I don't have the time to pay attention to it
*  I'll come back to it cook all day or or they tasted the smoke in something. They're like man, that's good
*  How do we how do we just get that flavor? I don't know but thank God for him
*  Thank God for them because they they do know how is that an American idea?
*  Tory kiln smokehouse the first smoking device in smoking history and what did they cook there? Is that salmon?
*  People love smoked salmon
*  Just meats Scotland, oh, yeah because in Montreal smoked meat is like that's what they call like deli meat
*  Yeah, yeah, well, it's something like a shrami. Yeah, I'm like pastrami, but it melts in your mouth
*  Montreal. Yeah
*  Place where you line up outside. What is that place called?
*  It I don't know how I'm forgetting the name cuz I've been about yeah you and now here's a place
*  You talk about social distancing. There is no you you just had to sit at the bench
*  Next to whoever yeah and eat your smoked meat and then as soon as you finish they were like, alright get out
*  Some of the way for your seat. Yeah, that's not the name is to the places. I feel like
*  Yeah, it's it was like a dude's name like Frank's or something like that
*  Me, but it's a smoked meat. It's the most don't don't look up smokehouse look at smoke meat
*  Yeah, there you go. See there it is smoked meat too. See if there's a restaurant shows
*  As much as we've done the festival
*  That's it look at that 12,000 reviews all five stars, yep
*  You wait in line you get your smoked meat you sit down next to whoever you eat it and you get the hell out
*  Oh shit, they're open. I guess they're open doing to go in Montreal. It's so cold up there that virus doesn't have a chance
*  As soon as it comes out of your mouth
*  Virus in Winnipeg. I remember the first time you're wishing for a virus in Winnipeg
*  That's what it looks like to God. Yeah, it's good. Yeah. Oh
*  There's something like the Jews know how to make those goddamn meat sandwiches. Yeah pastrami pastrami Reuben from Cantor's. Yes
*  Oh
*  Open our canters open canters open
*  I hope we don't lose too many restaurants man. I'm real good
*  We're gonna lose a lot of the private, you know, the ones that aren't part of a chain or you know, whatever
*  And we got to support them. Yeah, that whole thing was crazy
*  We're like Ruth's Chris gets 20 million dollars and you know all of that
*  Well, I guess they think of it from an economic perspective Ruth's Chris employees, you know
*  50,000 people or whatever it is different locations. You know what it was it was that they went by individual restaurants
*  So like if you had I think if you had over six thousand employees or something you were considered a big business
*  But each restaurant only has you know 40 50 people so that's how they got the money
*  Small business right? Yeah, they got small
*  Rats because that stores under less than 50 right they count each one. They don't count the whole
*  Nationwide corporation they count each one and that's why they got the money
*  So individual Ruth's got that's the money and like so you could own
*  Alonzo Bowden's Ruth Chris you could have your own Ruth Chris
*  Right. Well, the theory was that this money would be divided amongst all of the restaurants, but of course
*  It wasn't gonna happen
*  The money was just gonna go to corporate and then they basically they got shamed out of you know, they were like
*  They were shamed and they were they gave it back
*  I don't know if Ruth did Ruth's Chris yet because because like Steak Shack and the other places they were like no
*  We're not gonna take the money. Okay. Good Ruth's Chris take house returns a 20 million dollar federal loan in response to public demand
*  I remember Ruth's Chris back when people thought butter was bad for you. They were putting butter on steak
*  Yeah, that's back when they're like who gives a fuck about your health, right?
*  Butter on the steak and then the one they realize that butter is actually good for you
*  Like like Ruth Chris's had a game. They were the head of the game. They're way ahead
*  You ever hear the story of how they got that name
*  Yeah, I forgot it it was Chris's steakhouse and this woman bought it and in the contract they had to keep it Chris steakhouse
*  So that's why it's Ruth's Chris steakhouse. Ah
*  Good for her. Yeah, she's like fuck and then her brilliant idea and it was a great idea
*  She said that I think it was originally like in Louisiana and Texas and she said these businessmen travel and
*  Everywhere they go. They're gonna want to eat steak. So she started opening up
*  Where the you know where these guys went in business so that they would recognize the restaurant. She's a very smart woman
*  Very smart woman. That's a very built and franchise. That's very accurate
*  That's how she built the franchise if I'm with my friends, we're gonna go eat somewhere
*  We look for a steakhouse, right and if you recognize one and you know, it's good. Yeah, then that's where you go
*  Yeah, so good move. That's a good move. Yeah the whole
*  Steakhouse thing it's like that is a that's a very uniquely
*  At least we look at it that way a very uniquely American thing
*  I know they have steak houses other places, but you know, you know your numbers of steak houses
*  We have I think we have the number but those Brazilian steak houses to Oscar EAS
*  Where they just walk around with the meat and you and now that that's a male thing, right?
*  You know just you take a woman to a restaurant like look they've got unlimited meat
*  That's men just like it just bring me more bringing me meat
*  Absolutely place will wreck you yeah, it was a green put the green square up
*  That bitch over you will give up you will give up sometimes they just keep coming one after the other
*  For layman you always begin yeah, and they just carve it off for you right there
*  Oh, but but it's like that is such a yeah, that's like yeah, I'm just gonna sit here and we meet
*  I'm not gonna eat again for three days
*  But and and don't go there not hungry
*  Don't you know, I mean, this is not a place to go worrying about what you're gonna eat
*  Like they have that little salad bar over there and like yeah, whatever just keep bringing me different meat
*  Like the green is up. Yeah, that's how bars bullshit. Yeah
*  You want to lube up the shoot
*  That's what you do get some fiber in there. It's just so it kind of pushes
*  Pushes the shoot open a little bit gets everything ready for the barrage of carnage and I think this is that time where where
*  You know for me it's like I told you like you're doing great you're staying in shape and working out
*  I'm trying to keep moving. I'm riding a bicycle here and there
*  I told you starting to learn to jump the rope, but I will eat something like my justification is like well, listen
*  It's deadly virus. I don't want to die and not have had pizza
*  You know, and I know it's bullshit, but it's what I can tell myself
*  That's just what I tell myself to justify eating this shit at this time it's like well listen you live by yourself though
*  Yeah, yeah
*  We have meals because I'm eating at home with the kids and the wife so we every every meal is like has to be healthy
*  Yes, when you have kids, you can't feed kids bullshit, right? Like you have to have some healthy choices
*  You have to you're teaching them to eat healthy. Well, no, that's great
*  You know, you're not doing any working out at all
*  You know, you're not doing any working out at all. No, I do some the bicycle is actually you go outside or yeah bike
*  Yeah outside
*  Inside bike treadmill just so boring. I get the discipline of it, but it's boring, but no I'll get on my bike
*  But you know, it's great and you have a treadmill or an inside bike is movies. Yeah, watch fucking movie
*  You don't even know you're doing and you're an hour and a half in it's go. It's over. Hmm
*  An idea that's the move a guy told he was telling me he said get this Nordic track
*  I guess it's like the peloton and you know, oh, that's like your eyes and all no
*  That was the old Nordic track, but they make a bicycle now. That's like
*  Okay, and he was telling me and I said man
*  It's a lot of money to spend for something to hang my pants on
*  Do you remember when people have those bullshit ski machines in their house to pretend you're skiing? Yeah, nobody used those
*  You used it you used it three times it had the
*  cables
*  Cables you move back and forth and your feet slid back
*  You can tell if someone if you went over someone's house and they didn't have their shit together
*  They either had one of those or they had a bow flex
*  Yeah
*  They had like one or the what was the one was the one where it was?
*  It was just rubber plates and you would pull them apart. You remember wasn't a bow flex. It was like that though
*  It was like that I don't remember I do remember the bow flex and now they have a new bow flex
*  That's actually like a bow. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's like I forget what it's called. But yeah, there's a bunch of bow exercises
*  Right with it. Nobody's using that. No, you use it. You're gonna
*  Maybe I'll use it. Okay, but you know why because the commercial they get somebody who goes to the gym who works out regularly
*  To do the commercial and say yeah 20 minutes a day
*  With this and I have this body and you're like, no you don't
*  Cuz I know people with that body and their discipline is beyond belief
*  You know, you know me like like I used to I used to work with this trainer at Gold's and she was like
*  Amazing shape she had been a bodybuilder and then she shifted over to fitness
*  you know and she just just
*  Cut up and beautiful and this and that and and I used to tell her I was like you understand if you lived in like
*  Oklahoma or Iowa like women would kill you like they just wouldn't allow you to exist
*  Because you have this perfect body, you know, cuz cuz when they had that whole thing about
*  Women's bodies and that the false what was it the false image of women's bodies?
*  The problem with that is when you're in LA
*  That's not really false because those women the models who do those pictures are here. Yeah, they're there
*  You go to the unrealistic body expectations, right? Yeah, they're not unrealistic for guys though
*  Yeah, if you if you see nobody ever says that about you will bodybuilders are bullshit because they're fat guys or need love, too
*  Right you're giving us unrealistic body expectations. Nobody says anything about that. No, but but
*  Because but it's not feel bad about men that look like shit right women walking around like a guy who looks like shit has a
*  Shot, you know what? I mean, like women aren't as particular
*  Women aren't as picky about it as
*  Men are in our minds. You know what I'm saying?
*  Well, it's also that men control the advertising and men objectify women in these ads
*  But when men objectify men the ads for women no one cares
*  Well, you know why because if the guy's too pretty oh he's gay we could say that
*  Yeah, he's not but I mean that's the dismissal like in other words when women look at that woman and they
*  Sell that image. They never say she's trying to achieve that image, right?
*  But but when they show men that guy
*  Men are just like yeah, but he's gay
*  Then they don't have to try to compete with him
*  Yeah, you know, I let me tell you something man. I was hanging out with Tyson Beckford, you know Tyson is a bit too handsome
*  It was it was comical
*  It was literally I laughed like the way women would react when they saw him and the fact that you don't even
*  Exist in the world, but but it wasn't it's not even trying to compete. It's like yeah, okay
*  Well, I'm gonna play a pickup game with LeBron James. You know what I mean?
*  It was like well now there's no well, he's got two things going on
*  You just look it was just fun to watch but he's also got two things going on he's famous, too
*  Yeah, so he's famous as fuck and he's beautiful. Yeah, and he's tall and handsome. He's got everything. Yeah
*  Yeah, it was just that kind of thing. So, you know, so yeah the unrealistic expectation need, you know
*  My my unrealistic expectation went right out the window. It was like yeah, well I ain't competing with that
*  Girls do get mad though, but I think some guys get mad too. Yeah, some do bitch dudes
*  But girls will get really angry if they see like some some bitch that just showed up at the gym
*  She's got a perfect body right and then you're on your treadmill looking down at yourself. Fuck. Yeah
*  Yeah, and then if they do the whole sexy out workout outfit and the whole thing
*  You know a real problem. Yeah, they get mad at their husbands to fuck you looking at. Oh, yeah
*  but you know, it's
*  But again here in LA or like Miami. Oh, yeah
*  realistic Miami is
*  Miami should be rated R
*  First of like when you get off the plane and like listen, you're too young to be here
*  You're gonna you're gonna have to go up to Fort Lauderdale
*  17 it's not even rated R because you get rated R you can go with your parents if your parents are assholes
*  Are you 14? Yeah, my kid needs to see the slasher movie
*  The NC 17 like you can't take that kid in here the women walking around Miami
*  It's so sexy it again, it's just comical, you know
*  This is the other thing that like getting older like being my age. I'm in my 50s where I'm not chasing them anymore
*  So it's just fun to watch right, you know, I mean cuz it's like you're watching nature documentaries. Yeah, it's like
*  This is amazing like this do you see this one exotic bird and you just like she walks around like that
*  Every day all the time she just looks like that. It's incredible
*  Well, it's also superficial culture too is like there's people over there that are really rich. There's a lot of flossing
*  There's a lot of wearing the latest shit and driving the fastest the whole thing the whole diamonds on your watch and yeah
*  It's just fun to watch, you know
*  It's a very you get caught up in it if you get caught up in trying to be that then you got problems
*  But as long as you remember its entertainment
*  Because that's what it is. Well, it's a city that was sort of built on cocaine. Yeah, exactly
*  Which and and that's why it's funny now with with marijuana right with weed
*  They're like we don't know what to do with the weed money and this and that it's like
*  Well talk to the people who did Miami in the 80s because they managed to turn all that cocaine money into a city
*  Like they they've managed to well that's already been going on with weed in places where it's illegal like in Vancouver for the longest time
*  There's a documentary that was in way back in the day called the Union and it was all about how even though marijuana is illegal in
*  Vancouver the city literally depends on the industry is built on there's so much money in
*  Marijuana in Vancouver
*  I mean people kind of forgot about it because California has it legal now and Oregon and Washington State has it legal now, right?
*  But for the longest time we got a lot of our weed from from Vancouver a lot of British Columbia weed
*  And so this documentary was essentially showing how it's completely interconnected with the economy up there
*  It's enormous
*  And if they pulled out somehow another if marijuana and all the marijuana money just went away and it didn't exist anymore
*  The economy would probably fall apart or need a huge readjustment and that's the way Miami was. Yes
*  Yeah, Miami was like all the banks. Yeah
*  100 money down there. There's so many real estate like that was building office buildings and condos and and all
*  Was yeah, it was
*  You know, but what a city it's beautiful. What a city. It's a wild place
*  It's also on like a very porous stone, which will absolutely go underwater soon
*  And again, I love I have Florida friends I love them God is continually trying to destroy Florida
*  Just throwing things just hurricanes tornadoes and just every just just yeah, just keep throwing
*  Oh, and if you know about alligators to fucking alligators everywhere dinosaurs
*  This is how goofy California's California banned pythons and alligators to two things
*  They're trying to kill all day long in Florida. So you can't even buy python skin things
*  I mean literally there's a market for their invasive. It's a fucking giant
*  Snake that comes from another part of the world. They shouldn't even be right. Nothing can kill it
*  Florida they're killing they're paying people to kill them, right?
*  You can't even sell the skins in California and anything so goofy, but the thing with alligators, it's like
*  Why would you go near any water in Florida? You know, I mean like if there's a puddle like yes stay away
*  There's probably an alligator
*  I remember I played golf in Florida and they were like yeah when you hit your bomb in the water
*  Like you don't like it's gone. There was a huge one that just cause a traffic jam
*  So see if you can find that it was out today in the news
*  There was a huge alligator in Florida that was causing a traffic jam because it was walking across the road and people like what?
*  the fuck
*  like 16 foot long
*  Animals like since humans are locked away animals are coming out
*  Yeah, you know that they're like coming down into town looking for food at a bobcat back. Yeah, really? Yeah. Yeah, I hear him
*  Hucker I hear coyotes and owls. Oh, yeah, and and stuff, you know at night like
*  Yeah, they're close. They're moving in if it's as soon as we're gone
*  If we if we got wiped out this place would be overrun with animals in weeks. Yeah nature would come back real quick
*  Come back really find it
*  Maybe let me text it to you. Yeah, I'm in Florida. Is it two years old? Yeah, it's April 2018
*  There's no one that's new. There's not one that's new
*  Look at that thing maybe I
*  Think it's another one and that's in Jacksonville
*  Jacksonville is the town that there's a lot of crazy
*  Are you that's what the UFC is gonna be? Yeah, there's a lot of
*  that's where the beach thing was going that where the
*  spring break beaches were going and
*  Alright nothing there
*  Maybe someone sent me man found eaten by alligator actually died of meth overdose
*  No, you fucking do dive a meth overdose and an alligator comes along and eats you oh my god
*  Doing a podcast called fear not
*  With a guy named Barry Glassner who wrote a book called the culture of fear and it's about you know
*  What we fear in society and we had a segment to the podcast
*  It was just called fear, Florida because every week something would happen in Florida like Florida it just
*  Yeah, city of Lakeland closes portion of park because of snake orgy of course of course
*  And look look at the date look at the date Valentine's Day. It's on Valentine's Day
*  It's hilarious oh my god
*  Eleven foot alligator was found inside a clear water home last week of course you could you could you could do this
*  With no end Florida. It's an endless or go
*  It's just an amazing and again some good people Tampa. I love the city of Tampa. Yeah, I have great shows there
*  I love Tampa. Yeah, but man, I've had great times in West Palm with that the improv down there. Yeah
*  But some of the stories you hear and some of the things that happen you just like Florida you guys like Florida past
*  Mississippi a long time ago used to be Mississippi even California. We used to be the crazy state
*  Yeah, California was used now. We can't come
*  Used to call it God's waiting room. Yes, that's right the New York people that didn't want to deal with the winter anymore
*  Yeah, now it's just chaos
*  now
*  Madness and alligators there's so many alligators there does you ever watch small people you
*  Oh, man that one of the guys is not commercial
*  That's one of those shows that when you see it you're like I have to watch this one of the guys
*  It's a commercial killer of alligators. He got a tag for 500 alligators. You can kill five. That's how many they have
*  500 alligators, that's how there's not there's not a shortage these fine things my favorite thing about swamp people is
*  They're speaking English and they still have subtitles
*  Speaking English, but they have subtitles
*  There's that sort of Cajun's sort of way of talking which is real interesting right because that's a really unique
*  Subset of the southern accent that is the hillbilly hand fishing
*  Yeah, I've seen that with a noodle. Yeah, they catch the catfish by letting it clamp down the room, right?
*  What in the fuck? Yeah, but I guess if you get one of those fuckers, that's like a hundred pounds
*  Yeah, that's a lot of meat a lot of meat
*  So I guess they grab the gills they let this thing bite their arm. They put their hand in its mouth
*  They let it bite their arm and then they grab the gills and pull this fucker out
*  Remember we were talking about the guy who ate this
*  Slug. Yeah, you know that was the first hillbilly hand fishing guy was like hey watch this and he stuck his hand inside of a catfish
*  And pulled it out and they were like I'll be damn that's we got a way to do it
*  Yeah, how many guys lost their hands to snapping turtles doing that? Yeah, they're not gonna they never give you the bad side
*  Snapping turtles scare the fuck out of me when I lived in Florida for a bit
*  And when I was 11 years old I lived there tells 13 and we used to find these fucking turtles
*  I guess they're tortoises right because they're on dry land. I think it would be huge and they can bite through
*  Yeah, they're getting they bite your grotch like you're an 11 year old kid one decides to bite your dick that's it
*  They catch a finger that slice your finger right off clean off we would put the sticks near them and they would bite the sticks
*  Yeah, we're so stupid
*  No, you were 11. I was also around alligators all the time when I was 11
*  We used to go and throw marshmallows into the water and there was science telling you to stop feeding the alligators marshmallows after a while
*  But the alligators back then were actually they were
*  Endangered so yeah, there was a period and they were protected but then the population grew
*  Skyrocketed so much it went from them being protected to them giving someone 500 tags to kill them
*  In Orlando there was one of those alligator farms like you go and I said
*  That's for like when dad gets tired of the after his third day at Disney World when he's tired of the kids
*  It's like alright, let's go see some alligators. I don't give a shit. I'm tired
*  Well, there's something about alligators that we want to see always because they're so primal. It's such a dinosaur. Yeah
*  Literally
*  Yeah, they they're dinosaurs right they've been around forever
*  I've ever seen that video where the ladies throwing chickens off the balcony of these crocodiles and they're grabbing the meat and eating it and one
*  Of them reaches and doesn't get the meat and he just grabs his buddy's leg and spins and rips it off and swallows it
*  And his buddy doesn't even budge
*  Doesn't even budge did like the other alligator just ate his foot and he literally just looks around like or other crocodile
*  Rather just his foot. It doesn't even react. Does well that was like like the one way
*  What is it a deer or something's at the riverbank?
*  And the crocodile jumps out of the river and bites the whole thing and pulls it in watch this
*  So she throws this meat right they all stumble for it
*  And this one grabs a hold that one's foot and just watch does the death roll pops off the leg and then just swallows it
*  Well, thanks and look at the one. He just ate his fucking arm
*  Like did you just eat my foot just eat my fucking hand
*  How have we let this thing survive they're so gross they have moss growing all over their back
*  Creepy ass fucking monster. I was Google this alligator snapping turtle, which is the cross of both things
*  An alligator snapping turtle. Yeah. Oh jeez. Oh, I've seen those those are fucking enormous. Yeah
*  Where do those live and like this
*  Mexico and Central America
*  What the fuck?
*  You know what? I like that guy in the hat. That's how that guy always looks right on the right
*  Yeah, right like he's always that guy. He's hoping to be the next crocodile done. Yeah, look at him
*  No, yeah, he's the guy that does all the get standing by stuff. What is his name again?
*  Peterson oh, yeah, he's he's a silly silly man
*  That's the alligator one on the left and that regular one
*  He's the guy who lets he lets those bugs bite him and shit that have like crazy
*  There's a new show a shot was talking about I watched a little bit of it on the history channel
*  He's two guys one's an Australian dude one's an American and they go and they get
*  They like let themselves feel the pain and then explain it. Oh
*  And the larger away than he does almost dude. Hold up while we're doing this back that up a little bit while we're just talking
*  Look at the fucking right there leave it run there watch this fucking claws
*  Oh, yeah, so they go over his body here and you see the plates underneath them and then they show his claws
*  Look at that. It's like a grizzly bear. Yeah, and then they close in on his face
*  Look at the yap on that thing that might as well be in the Lord of the Rings. It might as well be an orc
*  They might as well be riding a horse swinging a fucking
*  Monster
*  You thought the honey badger didn't give a shit to alligator turtle. What what threat does he have? Is there anything that?
*  Probably that is a threat to him. I saw a video of a sea turtle that had a
*  Whole bite taken out of it like a cookie from a shark
*  Yeah, so a bull shark makes it through a fucking sea turtle
*  Cut through his shell cut half the body out and it was swimming away with three legs and the entrails were hanging out
*  It's like wow. Well, that's the other thing that's been here since the beginning right sharks. Yeah. Look at that. Look at that bite mark
*  Nature's metal is a great Twitter Instagram page rather
*  Yeah, yeah the one in the the middle up left. It looks like something took a bite out of it and it lived
*  Look at that. It healed up. Yeah Wow
*  Jesus Christ
*  It's hard out there for a pimp. Yeah. Yeah, the oceans the cruelest bitch. Yeah, cuz there's shit down at it
*  Everything's eating somebody right there
*  Like imagine if that was the outside world like everywhere you look is a fish trying to eat a fish something trying to kill
*  All the time all the time. It's like Africa like this the Serengeti squared. Yeah, you know, there's always something and we
*  Have no natural defenses. Yeah, we got nothing. We can't even move in
*  We got no fur. We got no claws. We got no scales. We're just we're delicious
*  You know, I mean like if you're a predator just an unarmed human being is
*  So easy so easy and the fact that we're so stupid at least on the ground
*  You feel like you might be able to like grab a rock and throw it at it or stab it with a knife
*  But when you're in the ocean, you can't do a fuck. You can't breathe
*  You can't even breathe
*  You're moving that you're the slowest thing you're thrashing around
*  Do you know how fast a shark moves and how fucking slow you are? Yeah, and you're like, oh just I'm curious
*  The sharks like oh here they come again the buffet what would it take to get you to start hunting?
*  You know, I don't know that I have the patience for it. I'm not you know, what if you were starving?
*  Well, yeah, obviously then but but I think hunting
*  It's there's a patience to it. It's one of those things where you wait a long time for that moment of action
*  So and well, it's a little bit kind of hunting you do
*  I see what you're saying with some hunting like tree stand hunting
*  You have to have an incredible amount of patience sit in a tree and you stay still and you stay up there a long time
*  But spot and stalk hunting it's not as much patience spot and stalk
*  You're moving along slowly and then you pull out your binoculars you glass the area
*  Sometimes you sit down you glass the area and then you find the animal and you slowly move towards them
*  You try to play the wind so the wind is blowing at you. So the animals
*  Yeah, so that kind of hunting is actually very very exciting, but it's also very rigorous exercise
*  You're going up and down mountains
*  It's like right you have to be in really good shape to be like if you're gonna hunt elk or mountain goats or some shit
*  You got to be in a really good shape, yeah, I don't know that that be my thing, you know
*  If you listen if there's a food shortage, I'm a big guy there's gonna be a smaller guy who has food I
*  Bought a Glock
*  What would it take to get you to move out of LA man? I don't know I mean in in some kind of disaster situation
*  You're talking about like earthquake type deal. Yeah, then then I would go but otherwise
*  I've thought about leaving here. You know, I've got friends who've left because of the cost of living and they live in much higher
*  Standard living in other places, but but I love LA at the end of the day. I love this part
*  You know the weather the the the roads I get to play with the motorcycles this and that so this is so my lifestyle
*  I mean, I'm mainly a road guy. I could live anywhere and still do
*  90% of the work I do
*  But I love living in LA so
*  If I were somehow priced out of it that would be the only way left
*  I mean obviously yeah, if there's an earthquake or a disaster or something then then I'll head to I love living in LA
*  the way LA was
*  Okay, yeah, I don't know if that's gonna be the case anymore
*  So that I'm like one of those guys like if you're playing musical chairs
*  I'm like this fucking music could shut off any second now
*  Now your kids have always lived here, right they grew up here. So what would their what do you think their thought would be?
*  Kids are adaptable man. They adapt really quickly. It's interesting because that's one of the things that I've noticed about them doing
*  Their schoolwork online. They do this good work on computers. They're adapting. They're dealing with it
*  They have facetime with their friends, you know, it's it's interesting
*  It's and I'm really proud of them for their their ability to adapt and not freak out about it and just accept
*  You know and we're spending a lot of time together. We do a lot of movie nights
*  I watch every fucking Adam Sandler movie that ever existed
*  Basically except little Nicky. I haven't seen that one. Yeah, but I
*  Don't I don't think as think as long as the family's there and there's other kids to be friends with
*  Kids can do all right. They'll adjust. Yeah
*  Partly that I mean not even partly a big part of that as testament to you and your wife as parents
*  To have kids who are like that, you know versus some kind of spoiled LA kid
*  Yeah couldn't have you know who sometimes moving is good to yeah. No listen if I had to I was just talking with a friend
*  This summer is 40 years for me in LA. I moved here in 1980
*  Yeah, so this summer is 40 years because his 40 year
*  Was this month and we were talking about it like when we first came here, we were kids, you know
*  18 19 right out of high school
*  Move from New York to LA and just mind blown and I've been here long enough to see it
*  That's why I said when you talk about LA how it used to be I can think of a few versions of the LA
*  I've lived in you know, I listen I got a buddy we talk about it
*  We could have bought parking lots in downtown LA for 25,000 bucks
*  You know, I mean downtown LA used to be like what you see is skid Row used to be the whole downtown
*  I was like nobody went downtown. Isn't that crazy?
*  You went downtown the bankers and insurance people were there during the day and then at five o'clock
*  It would just close how that happened and because there was nothing there
*  There was no reason to live there build those buildings down there because I don't because it was business and office buildings
*  I guess felt they needed to be downtown
*  But isn't that weird that they would just have this one spot where there's all these tall buildings
*  The only part in all of LA and no one wanted to live there
*  Yeah, yeah, and that's the opposite of other cities, right? Like you go to downtown Minneapolis
*  There's all these big buildings and a bunch of apartments and people live down there and it's totally normal
*  They tried to develop I remember in it in the 80s
*  They tried to develop downtown and nobody would move down there in the 90s
*  They tried to develop downtown and people just wouldn't move there
*  And then they finally when they got Staples Center and then they said the big difference was grocery stores
*  They said when they opened grocery stores because before if you live downtown you had to go to like
*  Brentwood or some Eagle Rock or or
*  Pasadena like you had to get on the freeway to go buy food
*  So once they developed the grocery stores then people
*  Start and and it was also I think it was also a matter of everywhere else got crowded and expensive
*  So initially downtown was cheap and then it became the the cool spot to be but it's so bum-infested
*  Oh, yeah, so crazy how many homeless people are shit on the streets out there
*  But it but again like if if you know, it's one of those if I knew then what I know now
*  You know, I mean like in the 80s man. I could have just bought a
*  Just a parking lot down. Maybe there's a spot right now. There is we don't we don't know where it is
*  You know Englewood Englewood
*  five years ago
*  Because now Englewood was getting a new football stadium the new basketball arena. They're developing adults, but now it's too late, right?
*  So yeah, so who knows what that next area?
*  What do they call that gentrification? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, I
*  Wonder because I wonder how much of an effect this is gonna first of all
*  I've talked to my friends in New York City and they said that a lot of the real estate people are preparing for a mass exodus
*  They're saying first of all if New York City can't be New York City anymore
*  Like it can't be everybody's just coming there from everywhere else and filling the streets and super crowded if that can't be the case
*  Then what is it?
*  And if it really is a place where the virus might kick back in again and have a second wave
*  People are not gonna want to buy there. Well, just look at look at the past right because if you look at New York in
*  the 60s and 70s
*  People didn't want to live in a city. They lived in the suburbs, right?
*  And then the gentrification was all the people in the suburbs their kids
*  Wanted to live in the city
*  So it would be another movement out of the city to the suburbs and the cities would I don't know
*  Fall is the right word, but the cities would know you know, you know
*  I mean because commerce wise it's always gonna be in the city because business is done
*  There but that's no but that's the other but that's changing now with virtual shit with virtual stuff
*  But there's there's especially New York New York's going to be a city because New York is a gateway into the United States in New York is
*  banking
*  You know Wall Street and all of that. So to an extent New York's gonna be New York
*  But as far as people living there, yeah
*  A lot of people they may go to their homes in the Hamptons or in whatever and say you know what?
*  I don't need to go to city and all those restaurants that have been there forever like Keene steakhouse
*  Yeah places that have been there since some of those are already they're already saying some of those won't be back
*  Fuck already saying some of those places won't be back
*  Like New York had so many rest New York has so many
*  Things but we don't who knows right?
*  No, like like fashion right who knows is fashion gonna be a thing or are we all gonna just wear sweatpants now?
*  Have you seen so many people that have been doing these things where they're wearing suit and tie
*  Yeah, but they're wearing shorts shorts and they get busted. Yeah shorts and no underwear, right? Yeah, so
*  You know, yeah, what's the new normal gonna be?
*  In so many levels cars, right people now they're buying cars online. So is it gonna go back to
*  going down to the car dealership and arguing with this guy and
*  And all of that bullshit or is it just gonna be like hey, man, I'm going online
*  This is what I'm paying and then I'm gonna go down there and pick up my car
*  I don't know
*  Well, a lot of people are still gonna want to kick the tires drive it a little bit see what it is
*  You don't know there's so many cars that drive so differently
*  You don't know what to expect unless there's a place we could test drive a car
*  You're gonna be more reluctant to make that well, you can you can still test drive but the negotiation and the bullshit part
*  Are people still gonna want to do that?
*  They're gonna want to because it's gonna be a limited number of cars
*  Especially the cars that got that get overpriced like a new Corvette like they're they sell them way above sticker, right?
*  Because there's not that many of them those kind of cars you're still gonna be able to make money
*  Yeah
*  But the cars that are the most cars that sell the transportation car the Camry's right of cords and stuff like that
*  Yeah, the people really they're like, I don't need to test drive it. I know what it is
*  Well, the real problem is it's a supply and demand thing, right?
*  And then the other thing is like do we need to keep making cars?
*  Like how many of these cars that we still have could we fix up right and get get on the road again?
*  And what point in time do we stop?
*  Every year flooding the market with a million new cars or whatever the number is. Yeah
*  But it's part of our economy
*  It is and it's a tradition and and you got all these people in Georgia now who are gonna be driving
*  But you know what else is a part of our comedy economy fixing cars
*  Yeah, you know and there's there's a there's something to be said for that more of that is going away
*  Yeah, because cars are so
*  efficient and digital now
*  you know that that mechanic that you used to go to down the street like he doesn't exist anymore because
*  He's got to have all this equipment to plug the car in
*  Yeah, and find out you know, I mean I drive a BMW and I say like when you lift the hood of my car
*  This it should just say none of your business
*  There's nothing under here for you to touch
*  You don't know how you know, you know what I mean? Like you have looking at you have to take this to the dealer
*  And so many cars are like that now yet Tesla
*  The electric cars are all gonna be like that. You have to you're gonna have to take it back
*  It's gonna be like an apple to where you bought it. Yeah, you're gonna have to take it to electronics store
*  And if there's a an accident, I don't even know like you can't take a Tesla to a body shop, right?
*  You have to take it back to Tesla or what? No, you can bring it to a body shop. Okay
*  Yes, different body shops that service Tesla only right? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I mean
*  You got to have you got to have a guy who knows because it's digital sensors
*  It's this or that the other it's not just putting a fender back on
*  Because that fender has a camera in it and a sensor and a this and a that right depending upon what happened to it
*  Sure. Yeah
*  Yeah, those that's the future to the future is a missionless vehicle
*  So what we're accustomed to we're seeing here over the last month where there's no fucking pollution this guy
*  That's probably gonna be the future and people also have to adapt, you know people
*  From a technological standpoint in other words, like if you've been fixing
*  Well, I'll give you an example used to fix carburetors
*  Then you better learn to fix fuel injection because all cars are fuel injected now
*  There's a few classic cars with carburetors and there's a few guys that they need to fix them
*  But other than that, yeah, if you want to work so so you're gonna if you're fixing cars
*  Either you're gonna have to adapt to this digital car or you're just gonna go out of business, you know
*  They're gonna work on old cars. Yes
*  That many you know, I mean it becomes more of a specialty because there are fewer of them
*  Yeah, it's like 60s muscle cars, right?
*  They're great, but there aren't enough to support all the mechanics that used to fix them. That's true
*  You know, so you you
*  You got to adapt you got to adapt you got to adapt and and there's always those people say add these new ones ain't no
*  It's like no the new ones are good. It's different
*  Yeah, it's not my thing fucking spaceship. Yeah
*  How's it not your thing? It's amazing. This guy told me he told me something and when he told me it hit he said
*  You know why you don't like Tesla's he said because you like cars and the Tesla's an appliance
*  And I was like, yeah
*  That's it. It's so
*  You know, it doesn't make any noise it works
*  But it doesn't have the visceral feel of you you drive a 911, right? Yeah, I have one of those
*  Does not have that visceral feel of driving no, but it's way better to drive efficiently
*  Yeah, not just efficiently the way it moves. I know just goes around things so quickly like you accelerate
*  It's the instant torque. It's the instant torque of electric motors, but I still and you know
*  Maybe I'm that dinosaur or whatever and I don't knock Tesla's like if you want a Tesla have a Tesla and have fun with it
*  I'm not saying you shouldn't I just know it's not for me. No, I prefer
*  I
*  Like engines too. I like shifting my own gears. I like manual transmissions, but I also like that Tesla
*  That is fun as fuck that again. I get it, you know, and and then and I also get the people who say hey if you're
*  Sitting in traffic on the 405 and the car can drive itself. Let it do it. Yeah, you know, oh, it's way less stressful
*  I'm also Joe. I'm also out there on a motorcycle man, and I see I'm scared of Tesla people
*  That's a point they trust the automatic driving
*  Not paying attention right? Yeah, and I'm out there like I'm their target. I don't know that that test
*  I don't know that your car sees me on a bike. That's a good point
*  My friend was saying that he answers his emails when he's driving. I'm like, oh my god. No, you don't. Yeah
*  He does he goes. Yeah, I do I can answer my emails
*  I go what on the highway people do things behind the wheel
*  That was scared the hell out of you like now
*  With the trusting the freeways are empty now
*  People are driving so fast and it's people who don't know how to drive fast
*  I don't mind someone driving fast who knows how to drive fast or they have a car mind it may go fast
*  Yeah, but you got I mean man. I'm doing 80 and getting just rocketing past me. Like I know you're doing a hundred
*  Yeah, I know you're doing a buck
*  driver
*  On Michigan Highway during lockdown. Yeah, what was he driving?
*  2016 Dodge probably yeah the Hellcat Wow
*  180
*  How'd they catch him?
*  Helicopter yeah, they saw him in any
*  Jesus one saw him and then they waited for him. Oh set it up up ahead
*  Hellcat challenger that's what it is. Okay. You don't know shit about cars son of a bitch
*  Yeah, but but there are people and there are a lot of cops out now, you know, yeah, there's a lot of cops writing tickets
*  Good, you know, you don't want a hundred mile an hour ticket. How about 180?
*  They must just put you in jail think 180 here that I think in the California
*  I think you go to jail at a hundred or more really they can they don't necessarily do but 180
*  There's a real good argument be locked up. He said my fault. I was speeding with another vehicle. Sorry, according to the officer
*  My fault, sorry. Well, sounds good. Where's the other car?
*  That wasn't in Detroit
*  No in Detroit. I thought sorry ain't gonna work that had to be somewhere in outer Michigan somewhere that
*  Sorry, sorry getting you off the hook in Detroit
*  You know Michigan's a good example of how things can change right because Michigan used to be Detroit used to be the most
*  Profitable or the richest state or the richest city rather. Let me get this out, right?
*  Detroit used to be the richest city. It used to be a hugely rich city back when they were making cars there
*  Yeah, I mean they still make some cars there but back when it was the place
*  Don't don't even get me started on the American car industry
*  Because you talk about a group that took it for granted and didn't adapt to the times
*  Yeah, and literally sat there and watched the Japanese take all of their business. They they watched the Camry become a Chevy
*  Yeah, I used to be just we gonna buy it use Chevy versus Ford right you you remember your family
*  You had Chevy families and Ford families
*  It was but there was no talk of any and they they they had that market and they just sat back and let
*  Built crappy cars and blah blah blah and let that whole thing go. It's ridiculous
*  Well, things get weird when you ship stuff overseas to or ship jobs overseas
*  Things are cheaper to make in Mexico or they're cheaper to make in China
*  Yeah that that exists but but as far as the cars they I mean American cars in the 70s and 80s were garbage
*  garbage
*  They were and and that was a choice the factory could have made they could have made better cars
*  And they just chose not to do you think people are gonna be more?
*  Open to the idea of American-made businesses supporting American-made businesses after you realize how difficult it is to get things from China
*  During a pandemic and how we're so relying on China for medicine and for electronics and so many different things
*  One would hope I think that there's two ways to do it either
*  we do that support American businesses or
*  And this is a worldwide thing open up to the idea of globalization
*  We're thing where it's a global economy
*  Not an individual nation economy, you know, then who runs it China?
*  No, the fuck out of here America know well the same people who run it now right the bankers
*  Right there. I mean they don't give a shit. They don't give a shit about where the money comes from
*  They're running the money worldwide
*  You know, they're they're in in contact with each other
*  You know, I mean that and I'm not even talking from a conspiracy theory thing. Like that's just how it works
*  Money flows throughout the world. And and so if you're financing, I
*  Don't know if you're financing Apple computer and
*  Apple computer is building their computers in China if you're the bank on Wall Street
*  You don't care you care about Apple paying their
*  Stock dividends or paying their bills, you know what I mean?
*  So so the bankers who run this who are behind it. They don't give a shit, right?
*  I just want to make sure it stays profitable, right?
*  Sacrifice that for some ideal of it's good to buy American, right?
*  Right, but if you can show some if you can show a way to profitably make it American
*  You'd have to get people from America to really find value in buying something
*  That's America because it would cost more like how much would it cost to didn't we've done this before how much would cost to?
*  Make an American phone
*  Everything everything made over here is that even possible? I
*  Don't think so
*  Isn't that crazy when you think about how many people here have phones, yeah, how many people are addicted to phones
*  We can't even make our own
*  But we gave that up
*  But forever can we just can't we adjust?
*  Oh, the only way to just is if other countries bring up their standard living to ours and their
*  Income level ours then the price of labor becomes the same
*  Because that's the big variable. That's the big or you make so much value in things being American
*  That you'll pay more for it the same way you pay more for labels, right?
*  Like you'll pay more for Nike than you do for some no-name sneaker, but then then you have to make it a better product
*  Well, Nike's a really good product, but there's some sneakers that are not as well known
*  They're also really good products, but they'll cost like half as much. Yeah, because Nike has a lot of name-brand value
*  I don't know why I'm using the word Nike, but it could be anything
*  You could have Adidas
*  There's a lot of things that people will buy and they'll pay more for because it's a brand
*  Yeah branding makes a difference, but it's about the brand of American made you again make it better
*  This was a thing right when an American car
*  Automatically meant necessarily better right? There's a pride in owning Nike you you've owned something that's got a great label
*  What about a pride in owning something that's made in America?
*  But you also have faith in the label in other words when you buy a Nike shoe
*  That's true. You have faith that this is a good shoe. It's a quality shoe, right?
*  So if if there was a time when made in America
*  Meant it was better right the cars are a perfect example
*  So you automatically bought it so now?
*  You have to once again build that in and it takes a long time
*  This is another thing about American economy versus world right American economy. They're based on the profits in the next quarter
*  You know whereas like Toyota was making plans in the 70s to run the American the world car market
*  In the 90s like they plan
*  Long-term you have to look at it like that
*  That it's not just a matter of quarterly dividends you you have to look at what are we doing with this company?
*  And it has to constantly make more money every year. It has to make more money than the last
*  That's how you know it's doing well
*  Yeah, and you have stockholders that you have to you know you're you have to listen to them
*  And you adapt and try to make a better product. I mean you look at like windows right like we're on windows
*  Whatever we're not still on windows one
*  Yeah, because they were like oh this works better. Oh this didn't work. We got to change that
*  Oh this works better, and they you keep adapting and changing the product or the same thing now sometimes
*  You know like with the Apple with iPhones
*  It's like sometimes look you that phone you just change it for the sake of changing it like there's a reason
*  There was no iPhone 9 right they were like alright. We can't fool them anymore
*  We got a whole no they made it the iPhone 10 because it was the 10th year
*  That is a 10 year anniversary the iPhone 2017 it started out in 2007 so
*  2017 there's iPhone X to mark the 10 year anniversary
*  That's why there's no iPhone 9, but there is an iPhone 9 now. It's a SC SC. Yeah, so you need to I
*  Think you can do it, but you have to build a value into making it
*  American part of that is is marketing right like the f-150
*  There's nothing more American than a Ford pickup truck, but it's made in Mexico is it really yeah, there's f-150 plants in Mexico
*  They're not all made here in the u.s.. Just like
*  BMWs SUVs are made in South Carolina
*  Yeah, isn't that weird Honda's?
*  Ohio made in Ohio, so you and this is what I'm talking about about the global part
*  They figured out well it was cheaper to make because America buys the most SUVs
*  So BMW said well, let's just make them there then we don't have to ship them across an ocean right
*  Make sense and then the same thing probably the NSX so like listen
*  It's gonna be a bunch of wacky Americans by this fucking
*  Super horsepower four-wheel drive Honda right so you you make it there big now when you talk about that value
*  There are some things like
*  Like Ferraris. You know like it's a Ferrari
*  So it it has a value to it and the fact that it's Italian adds to the value of it right just yeah
*  Yeah, when you talk about adding value like some Italian like we're just like well
*  Yeah, that's even though a lot of times the quality was like you know
*  Falling off or whatever, but it was just the fact that it's Italian so yes
*  We could do that, but I don't know that that anybody will yeah, I was designed by artisans
*  That's the idea I mean if you go a buddy of mine went to the Lamborghini factory
*  He said first of all he goes they stop working for like two or three hours, and they just eat pasta and take naps
*  Yeah, and he's like it takes forever to make your car. Yeah, but they do it all by hand
*  Yeah, you know and and it there really is an art to it. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, we don't I mean we don't make bad cars anymore
*  The cars we make now are getting a lot better than they used to be like like especially SUVs like the new Lincoln Navigator is
*  Amazing I love that there's a new escalate that they're gonna release right looks gonna be amazing fucking incredible
*  Which they had to do because the new Navigator was so yeah, and then they have the new mid-engine Corvette
*  Which is a monster?
*  I mean that's an incredible platform that they're operating on and people that drive it said it's like leaps and bounds better than any Corvette
*  That's ever existed before and then we have great Camaro's. There's a lot of shit. They make now. That's good
*  The new Mustangs are amazing there are a lot of great American cars the problem is they let their reputation
*  slack so much that if you talk to a
*  New car like a first-time car buyer and ask them what they want. They're not gonna name an American car
*  They want a Mercedes or a Porsche right or they want or you know a
*  Toyota or a Honda or something like that something super reliable
*  You know people would ask me what to buy and cars and I'd always tell them
*  Get a Honda because it's just gonna run forever. It ain't gonna break Toyota same thing Toyota's the same
*  You know, but yeah, you get one of those and and I wish I could say get it get a Chevy
*  And I'm sure there is one but I don't know what it is
*  I don't know what to do if I've owned two of those original NSX's I had one I got rid of it
*  I got a second one I got rid of that. I never had a problem
*  No, not a single problem and their sports cars mid-engine sports car like a race car. No problems last forever
*  Yeah, and and they they were all built like that and it's just a level of quality
*  But yeah, you're right. Listen the Camaro's that the Navigators the Mustangs
*  There's so many cars like that that are great American cars
*  But people they again you hurt your reputation for so long so many bad ones for so long that people like man
*  I had a 78 Corvette
*  It's the worst car I ever owned it was
*  Man Joe and and when it would break it wasn't mild like it wasn't you know, no it was like
*  Oh, yeah, your intake manifold cracked like, you know intake manifold like a major
*  Metal piece of the end. They're like, yeah that just cracked
*  Yeah, your radiator the bottom of it just rusted out to nothing just you know, like it was oh man that and what ultimately
*  killed the car was
*  the wheel came loose
*  The wheel came off the car while I was driving
*  Did something break off of the suspension? Yeah. Yeah the the
*  What is that the controller arms the control arm behind the brake? Yeah. Oh, it just yeah, so it lost the wheel
*  Yeah, they made some dogshit cars
*  They were because that was when they were trying to figure out emissions and they were trying to figure out mileage
*  Mileage and you had like you had a small block v8 engine. I remember the car only made 180 horsepower
*  Like like I have motorcycles that make that much horsepower. This was a Corvette. How slow would it be? Oh Joe?
*  It was a horrible thing
*  180 horsepower for a Corvette sounds so crazy because now the base models like 460. Yeah, but at that time
*  You know in 1978 that's when they had the Mustang too
*  Camaro was a full-size Camaro that came with like a six-cylinder engine that made like
*  98 horsepower
*  Yeah
*  Exactly was this big steel car with a little yeah, it was American cars
*  Where you know, I love my country those cars were garbage
*  That was a Mustang you imagine imagine going from go take that get a good look at it
*  Right get it now. I want you to say 69 Mach 1
*  Down you Google a 69 Mach 1 Mustang and then you realize how fucking far the
*  Right there right there. Boom son. I mean what the fuck?
*  Well, is that the same thing that is a monstrous?
*  beautiful sexy
*  ferocious because you took the company away from the engineers and you gave it to the bean counters and the board members
*  Who didn't you know who didn't want to drive didn't like you saw Ford versus Ferrari? I haven't seen it
*  Oh, you haven't seen it. I see it's great movie great movie. That movie looks like a bad company song. It was
*  right, but that car brother there's a scene in the movie where the the
*  heads like the CEO or whatever of Ford goes to see Carroll Shelby and
*  Carroll Shelby puts him in one of his cars and says
*  Take him out and they scare the shit out of him
*  Like they show the car like it's so fast and powerful that the guys like it build one
*  You know
*  But these are people like this is what happens when you have a car company run by people who don't know shit about cars
*  You get a Mustang too. God damn you get a hundred and eighty horsepower
*  Corvette that wheels fall off just imagine though going from that 69 Mach 1 to that
*  That Mustang too in just ten years right years man, that's crazy
*  I'm here that were there for the Mach 1 had to be like what the fuck imagine if that happened to us from
*  2010 to 2020
*  You'd be like what the fuck happened 2010 was not that long ago. Listen
*  Go to the 80s when remember they tried the front-wheel drive cars like the Chevy Citation
*  No, man a front-wheel drive car all of those cars those me and my brother laugh about those cars because they were such crap
*  the citation had a vertical radio for some reason and
*  We there was a an Oldsmobile
*  Remember, I don't know if you remember this the four six eight engine
*  That was an eight cylinder engine that would cut off cylinders like cut down the six
*  When you're on the highway when you're cruising yes, and of course it didn't work
*  The theory was great that yeah, you're in v8 when you need it in a force but but they still have that kind of setup on
*  Some catalyst yeah, but now they have computers and electronic fuel controls that it actually works back
*  It was like no this shit don't work
*  Ever a business that's fallen so hard so fast as the United States automobile business from like the 60s to the 70s steel
*  US Steel yeah, yeah, they started I think Japan took over steel
*  Because I knew people in Pittsburgh when steel went Pittsburgh went
*  Almost bankrupt Pittsburgh had the same fall as Detroit, but they bounced back
*  But yeah
*  That hope that whole thing man they used to build Camaros and firebirds right here in Van Nuys
*  Did they really yeah in the 80s when I moved here?
*  The Camaro firebird plant was in Van Nuys that built some dog shit cars
*  Yeah, those 1980s firebirds what in the fuck are you under chicken man you get that big sticker on the remember that yeah, but
*  Some that they did good
*  That's one that you don't see enough resto mods done correctly like it feels like if someone took like a Burt Reynolds style
*  Trans-am yeah and did it correctly and redid it you just don't see much like look at that
*  Yeah, if someone just did that right?
*  But those were the cars they had a big engine that made no power
*  You know it was just a big big engine that didn't make any power, but God it looked like it did look like a great car
*  Remember teatops remember those I do remember those you had to take your teatops off and put them in the trunk
*  It's funny though that was the only car that had a painting on every hood like that yeah
*  Yeah, the trans am was the one you had to get the funded chicken yeah
*  There's one in that show that I watch Ozark
*  Yeah, watch it Jamie that guy's got a pretty badass one see if you could find that and see Google Trans Am from Ozark stumble across
*  A spoiler I bet oh you think so oh
*  You haven't seen the trans am yet just just right trans am and did from Ozark wasn't a night rider
*  Wasn't that a trans am or a firebird?
*  I think that was a
*  That was an 80s firebird yeah, no that's not it. It's it's a it's an older one. Yeah
*  Exactly let me see what that looks like yeah, that's pretty fucking nice. Yeah. He's got a pretty fucking nice one
*  That's rare though that you see like a resto model. They're really done up trans am
*  Yeah, you had a 80s um night rider was an 80s trans am yeah, talk to him right damn
*  Yeah
*  Rapidly watch 80s TV shows like drama shows the 80s was a special time
*  And there's so many things there's so many things 80s Miami vice yes
*  Right there's so many things 80s that were just 80s. Yeah
*  Yeah, but
*  Miami vice man didn't he what do you have a Lamborghini or something like that or some rari testarosa? Yeah, testarosa that
*  Yeah, white testarosa with the things on the side the Crockett and tubs
*  Yeah, the pastel suits yes with no socks they had no socks on always look at them
*  loafers no socks
*  Not a bad show back. That was a Ferrari that car. Yeah, that was a different Ferrari. I think that was what he had early
*  He had that one that and then he got the testarosa
*  That's weird being the other guy though right like Don Johnson
*  Entire career gotta suck and then you're the what were we watching there was some oh
*  Transformers was on right and you know in the first scene in the Transformers when they're in the
*  desert and it's like
*  There's like five military guys
*  You know and then the first three to get killed I was like imagine being one of those guys
*  And then you watch Tyrese Gibson and the other guy go on to this
*  Billion dollar franchise and like you got killed in the first scene like you
*  Why didn't I live?
*  By the way, I've been that guy in a few movies
*  How many movies have you done? I haven't done many. I've done maybe five. I am very strict in my casting
*  I can be a security guard or a bouncer
*  Security guard or a bouncer
*  Played a security guard as a bouncer and
*  When you think about those kind of shows like Fast and the Furious like those movies, how the fuck did that happen?
*  How did those movies make that much money? It's a simple formula
*  But how many people are buying that simple formula over and over again?
*  How is that happening because it's it's almost like a cartoon, right? Listen, I like when first Fast and Furious came out
*  It's like okay. We got cars. We got women. We got guns
*  Do we even need a script? Do we even need a script? Just turn it loose and that's what every movie right?
*  That's like yeah, just make the cars bigger make the guns bigger make the guys bigger drifting, right?
*  Women are hotter. Yep. If you watch the Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift
*  Apparently every schoolgirl in Japan is wearing a Catholic school miniskirt at all times
*  But it works it's a simple formula
*  Look at the amount of money it made. Absolutely. Oh my god 1 billion 518 million
*  722 thousand seven hundred and ninety four. Yeah, what in the fuck worldwide is way better this year. Oh my god
*  That's so that's the one movie. That's the Fast the Furious 7 right one movie made that much money
*  But look at I mean two of their movies made over a billion dollars. Yeah, why wouldn't they though?
*  It's a cartoon formula that works that's amazing. It's a formula that works
*  It's a total six billion worldwide flashy beauty. Yes stuff like that
*  You know, yeah, how could it not work? How could it not work?
*  You know, yeah
*  All right, and if I told you I'm the head writer if I tell you I wrote the Fast and Furious
*  I how you gonna prove me wrong?
*  Listen man, I love muscle
