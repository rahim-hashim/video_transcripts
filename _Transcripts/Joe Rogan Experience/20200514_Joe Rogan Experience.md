# Joe Rogan Experience #1474 - Dr. Rhonda Patrick
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_ZJ8YDOX6g)
*  What were you saying?
*  Damn you.
*  You suck.
*  No.
*  It's not that embarrassing.
*  You just, you get, go ahead.
*  Like sometimes when I get nervous, my eye will start watering.
*  Like I don't think that's odd.
*  I think that's probably pretty normal.
*  I mean, your system's fired up and you know, your eyes are probably trying to clear themselves.
*  Right?
*  Maybe, you know, I mean, I'm just speculating.
*  Maybe people will message me after this podcast and be like, that happens to me too and I'll
*  feel better.
*  I'm sure.
*  It doesn't sound that odd.
*  That's not certainly not embarrassing.
*  So I don't know why I'm embarrassed by eyes watering if you're nervous.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  I am super, I'm always happy to come.
*  Well we've been talking and we've been talking about immune systems and this is one of the
*  main things that I wanted to talk to you about.
*  Like what are the strictest?
*  All we're hearing is shelter in place, wear a mask, don't touch anybody, don't go outside.
*  We're not hearing what can you do to strengthen your immune system?
*  And I think that as a public health, a public service, you know, health thing, this is one
*  of the most important things that I think you can really focus and concentrate on and
*  an actual thing that you could be proactive about during this weird time.
*  Yeah.
*  Well definitely I think focusing on, you know, lifestyle factors that you can, you know,
*  modulate your immune system and strengthen it is important.
*  What's interesting is that the immune system, you know, after doing just so much, of course
*  the past like couple of months, I've been nothing but like reading about the immune
*  system and trying to understand, of course, this new virus, SARS-CoV-2.
*  But I've just learned so much, you know, over the past couple of months.
*  I'm not an immunologist, I'm not an infectious disease expert.
*  So while I've had some training in immunology, I definitely don't know everything there is
*  to know.
*  But just doing some reading about like, why are people's immune systems so different?
*  Like that's the big thing.
*  Like when you take like a young population, as you get older, your immune system does
*  decline.
*  I mean, there's lots of changes that occur.
*  But like in general, like people have different immune systems.
*  And what's interesting is that there's been tons of like genetic studies done on like,
*  you know, identical twins, and they're followed over time.
*  And what's found is that genetics is not the major regulator of immune function.
*  It's something in the environment.
*  And what this is what surprised me, and it's not totally going to answer your question,
*  but we can totally get to that.
*  But the main one of the main things besides age that regulates the immune system is like
*  previous exposure to viruses.
*  Like so I thought that was really interesting.
*  And in particular, one virus, the cytomegalovirus CMV.
*  Did you know like between 50 to 80% of the US population has it like, at least by the
*  time they're like an adult?
*  Has it permanently or has caught it?
*  It's a herpesvirus.
*  So it's a lifelong thing.
*  And this is why it basically so it changes your immune system.
*  What are the symptoms of it?
*  Most people that are healthy don't ever know they have it because there's no symptoms.
*  Well, yeah, unless you're immunocompromised.
*  Most people that are healthy, they don't know, you know, that they're infected with it.
*  Say it again.
*  What is it called?
*  The cytomegalovirus.
*  It's CMV.
*  Sounds like something Godzilla fights.
*  There it is.
*  So what's so interesting, but here's the interesting thing about this virus is that it so this
*  is one of the major things multiple studies have been looking at, like, you know, just
*  immune variability.
*  And it's like CMV has been identified in multiple studies.
*  And the thing that the reason it got me interested because I was like 80, almost 80%.
*  I could have it right.
*  Totally have it.
*  And it changes the immune function.
*  It's totally different between young and old.
*  So so when you're younger and if you have it, it actually enhances immune function.
*  So they've done studies where like they they have given people influenza vaccine.
*  And oftentimes these vaccine studies are used to kind of test the immune response and like
*  how robust your immune response is because you're you're given a vaccine and there's
*  all different types of vaccines, you know, pieces of an antigen or all different types
*  of, you know, ways that you can you can expose someone to a bacteria or virus.
*  But you have a response to it.
*  And the response is, you know, involves your adaptive immunity.
*  You make what's called neutralizing antibodies that, you know, basically eventually bind
*  to the virus and neutralize it, prevent it from entering the cell.
*  So people that have CMV, they're young, have a really robust response to the vaccine, much
*  better.
*  But older people have the complete opposite where it's like, you know, deleterious.
*  And the reason for that, scientists think, is because basically.
*  This virus, it's stuck with you lifelong and it kind of reactivates every few years.
*  And like every time it reactivates, it kind of trains your T cells, you know, which are
*  part of your immune system to to become focused on that CMV.
*  And so as you get older, your your T cell population becomes more focused on fighting
*  that virus and less so on other viruses that you're exposed to.
*  But this virus doesn't have any symptoms.
*  Most healthy people don't have any symptoms with it.
*  I know it's really like it's really weird.
*  So what I'm wondering and the reason I'm even like going here and it has nothing to do with,
*  you know, taking vitamin C or zinc and we can talk about that stuff and vitamin D.
*  But I just thought it was so damn interesting because we hear all these stories in the news
*  where, you know, some people are asymptomatic.
*  Some people are, you know, then some people are just really getting hard hit.
*  And these people, let's say they're more age matched.
*  Right. We know that elderly people are more prone to severe form.
*  But it just made me think, what if this, you know, previous previous viral exposure to
*  something like CMV is is kind of like also kind of shaping people's immune responses in some way.
*  Surely people are going to be looking looking at that.
*  But I just thought that was a really interesting thing to come across.
*  You know, and then the other sort of on the same on the same along the same lines as previous,
*  you know, previous virus exposure is like something that really seems to be something that is
*  a main regulator of how people like what how your immune, you know, what your immune response is.
*  You know, and so so you mean by how many times you've caught the flu?
*  How many times you've had whether you respond to it, how you respond to it, you know?
*  Yeah. I mean, like if you get the flu, is it going to not is it like a three day kind of thing
*  or is it going to knock you out for two weeks kind of thing?
*  That's what I mean. Right. So I mean, if you if you get a sample, like there's been these
*  sero surveys where they basically that just means they get a sample of plasma and look for
*  different antibodies, viral antibodies, and they'll find at any given points a person has like
*  antibodies against 10 different viruses just randomly, you know, so you're you're constantly
*  being exposed to viruses. You know, you're not always you just don't succumb to them.
*  Right. You're not always getting sick. And so, you know, like another really interesting kind of
*  thing is like, you know, there's so the SARS-CoV-2 virus is part of a family of of coronaviruses
*  called the beta coronaviruses. So SARS-CoV-1, the virus that was responsible for the original
*  SARS outbreak in 2002 or something. The MERS one in the Middle East. And then there's two
*  different ones that are responsible for the common cold. Now, coronaviruses are only responsible
*  between like 15 to 30 percent of common cold cases. So it's not like the common cold is
*  the illness you get, but there's lots of different viruses that can cause it.
*  But what's interesting is that there's been studies showing that these two beta coronaviruses
*  that are responsible for some of the common cold cross react with. So there's one that
*  cross reacts with the SARS-CoV-1, which has a very it's very the sequence is very homologous to
*  SARS-CoV-2 virus. And it's also been shown that the SARS-CoV-1 antibodies against the SARS-CoV-1
*  can neutralize the common cold one. So there's like cross immunity happening between these
*  other viruses. Right. And so there's been some studies by the CDC on SARS-CoV-2 where they
*  found basically that people that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 also boost their antibodies against
*  the common cold one. So, you know, there's there's certainly I think a good hypothesis to be made
*  that potentially, you know, one or two of these common cold viruses could the antibodies you make
*  against them could also somehow maybe maybe, you know, interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
*  potentially neutralize it. I mean, that's a big open question that seems possible.
*  Without we don't have an answer to that. I think we will. Like there's large there's large scale
*  CRO surveys being done. I know at least three that I think his name is Dr. Michael
*  Bush. He's at UCSF. He's like he's he's doing like really large surveys where they're they're
*  going to be analyzing CRO from people from like, you know, blood donors and stuff and like following
*  them over the course of several years to see, you know, just basically understand more. So
*  now what is the speculation if there's any sort of uniform speculation as to why when you hear
*  about prisons where a lot of these prisoners, I don't know if you've seen that there's a video
*  going around where one prisoner had SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19, whatever, and spitting into a cup and
*  then passing it around to all these other inmates so they could all get it so that they get released.
*  So these because they're releasing people, especially California, which is so wacky,
*  they're releasing sex offenders. And there's been some really high profile releases of these
*  horrible people that should be in jail probably forever and they're releasing them. It's like it
*  it's really disturbing. But what would cause other than something like that, what would cause
*  all these prisoners to not just be positive? That makes sense. But to all be asymptomatic.
*  Is there any speculation as to why large these large groups? There was another one that was a
*  meatpacking plant where most of the people were asymptomatic as well. I wasn't I wasn't aware of
*  the meatpacking one being asymptomatic. But I did read about the one in prison and it was like
*  blowing my mind like what's going on? Like that's insane. It's kind of like you read these stories.
*  So this is like there's one thing that it's important to keep in mind when we say asymptomatic.
*  Like, you know, there's asymptomatic in like a person that never actually gets symptoms, right?
*  And then there's asymptomatic. So there was a study done at the CDC, I don't know, a month ago,
*  maybe a little more, where they measured like they did it. They did this nasal pharyngeal swab
*  test in a nursing home, 70 something people, and 13 of them tested asymptomatic, like they had no
*  symptoms, but they tested positive. But then they went back a week later, and 10 of those people had
*  symptoms and three were asymptomatic. So unless like there's another like if you test someone and
*  they're asymptomatic at that time of testing, they could be pre symptomatic, right? In other words,
*  like you have to go back a week later and see if they have symptoms, because that's really important.
*  So let's say even, you know, 60% were asymptomatic. Like, I don't know if they went back and tested a
*  week later if it was just like a single time. But that's what this is what got me thinking about
*  this whole thing was, you know, in the prisons and jails, I mean, they're in close quarters and
*  there you got one virus that someone's exposed to and they all get it, right? So like, what if there's,
*  I don't know, the CMV, you know, percentage there, but what if the coronaviruses are going around there?
*  What if, what if, you know, some some common cold coronavirus has gone around and that,
*  you know, those antibodies that they've made to neutralize that coronavirus, beta coronavirus,
*  are somehow helping with the SARS-CoV-2? Like, I would love to see that tested.
*  Do you know if they immunize people, did vaccinate people when they go into jail?
*  I was trying to figure that out as well, because like the tuberculosis,
*  one of the types of vaccines they do for TB, I think they do it in like Japan and some other
*  countries where they've got a really low death rate and so they're kind of, that's a test,
*  that's a clinical trial that's now going on where they're trying to test. But I was trying to figure
*  out, is there a vaccination? I would imagine it would be simple for them to do that. You're
*  entering into prison, they just vaccinate you just to... I couldn't come to an answer. I was
*  searching for that the other day. I was trying to figure that out. But I think that's also a really
*  good... I mean, there's a ton of theories, right? I mean, it's just, you could go on and on and on,
*  but the whole... I just think that I would like to see more research and I'm just hoping
*  that CDC and other people are investigating these other... the cross-immunity, right?
*  If there's antibodies that you're making against another coronavirus, beta coronavirus,
*  that's in the same family as the SARS-1, no one's had SARS-1 in the United States. So like that one
*  doesn't... that's not as relevant as... but the common cold, that's very common, right? So if 15
*  to 30% of the common cold is composed of coronaviruses, we know at least two of those
*  coronaviruses are in the same family that have been identified to make... at least in one case,
*  there's been neutralizing antibodies, so there has been cross-immunity, then you'd think,
*  why not test that? Let's get some animal studies started on that.
*  Speaking of animal studies, there was an article that I was reading yesterday that was saying that
*  they're hoping that they've found some antibodies in llamas that they're hoping they're going to be
*  able to... because of... see if we can find this... because of these antibodies in llamas, they're
*  hoping they can either transfer them to people or learn something about how these antibodies are
*  created. But llamas seem to be... here it is. Llamas could be the key to fighting new coronaviruses.
*  Research says... make that larger... it says it may sound bizarre to most, but llamas could be the key
*  to fighting new coronavirus. Researchers from Belgium... oh, remember that's the big lady that
*  I was showing you earlier? She's the health lady. And the United States published an article this
*  week in the journal Cell that highlights the potential use of llama antibodies to prevent
*  COVID-19 infections. Antibodies from a four-year-old Belgian llama named Winter show promise in
*  blocking coronavirus from infecting cells, according to research from the University of Texas,
*  Austin, the National Institutes of Health, and the Ghent... how do you say that? Ghent? G-H-E-N-T
*  University. Studying earlier forms of the coronaviruses, researchers have found an antibody
*  in winter that effectively attached itself and neutralized spike protein in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
*  Researchers believe the particular antibody, which has been found in other llamas as well,
*  can be injected into an uninfected individual to protect them from getting infected with the new
*  coronavirus. That's very interesting. Yeah, so I think there's lots of avenues for therapeutics,
*  and in addition to repurposing drugs, monoclonal antibodies, being able to basically identify
*  antibodies that do neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus, whether they come from llamas or humans,
*  and basically identify the specific antibody that can bind to that spike protein that you
*  just mentioned, which is that region. It's known that the antibodies bind there and neutralize it.
*  It's also the region that is used to get inside of the cell. So monoclonal antibodies, I think,
*  are a really big possibility for a promising therapeutic because you can then ... I mean,
*  the problem is growing large scale manufacturing them, right? So if you can identify these
*  antibodies and then manufacture them, you can inject them in people and then potentially get
*  some protection. The problem is that it's just going to be a short-lived protection. It's not
*  like a vaccine where your body's making its own antibodies and they're more longer-lived.
*  Oh, I see. So in areas where people are getting exposed, perhaps you could give it to them. It
*  would stop them from getting ... but how long would you say short-lived?
*  I don't know. It's probably enough to ... like if you're a healthcare worker, your first responder,
*  people that are definitely being exposed to large doses of the virus, that could be a promising
*  area, but also I think even just treating patients that have already been infected.
*  In combination with some of this other stuff like remdesivir, which is ... it's not like a silver
*  bullet, but it seems like it's also promising probably with a combination of other factors as
*  well. But yeah, the monoclonal antibodies is a really ... I know there's ... Regeneron's a big
*  company. They're growing some large-scale ones. I think they isolated from humanized mice or
*  something, but there's other companies that have isolated them from humans that have been infected.
*  So that's definitely a promising area for sure. And a good thing about that is that ... have you
*  heard of antibody-dependent enhancement? No. So that's a big concern. All right. So basically,
*  when your body is exposed to a pathogen like a virus, your innate immune system, the first
*  line of defense like neutrophils, things like that, are making hydrogen peroxide, trying to
*  kill the virus. But then in the background, your adaptive immune system, and I'm just totally
*  generalizing, is also working in the background. And part of that adaptive immune response is
*  to produce antibodies. So you have memory B cells that are making antibodies that are specific to
*  bind to different regions, epitopes on the virus, and neutralize them, prevent them from getting
*  inside of the cell. And so that adaptive immune system usually takes about seven days after
*  you're exposed to the virus. The problem is antibody-dependent enhancement. So sometimes,
*  a neutralizing antibody is an antibody that can bind to the virus and neutralize it, stop it from
*  entering your cell. So it's doing its job. But you sometimes make antibodies that are
*  non-neutralizing or don't do as good of a job. They don't bind as tight or something.
*  And then you can have what's called antibody-dependent enhancement. And this was like a
*  big problem for the RSV vaccine. Back in the, you know, like most kids get RSV. It's a respiratory
*  tract infection. Most kids get it by the time they're two. Like there's no vaccine that's given.
*  Back in the 60s, there was this antibody-dependent enhancement
*  happening in some clinical studies with toddlers. And some toddlers got really,
*  really sick and a couple died. But what happens is basically the antibody binds to that. There's a
*  couple of things. The antibody binds to the virus and can basically change its confirmation and allow
*  the virus to get into the cell better. So then you become like, you know, you get like a higher
*  viral load and then you don't have antibodies to neutralize it. And it just, you know, it could be
*  more, it could lead to death. The other thing that happens is the antibody binds to the virus.
*  It doesn't neutralize it, but it like makes this crazy immune complex that like activates your
*  immune system to just go haywire and it causes all sorts of pathology. And that's what happened
*  with the RSV toddlers. So there's a few viruses that this happens with. And unfortunately,
*  coronavirus is one, like this has been identified with the SARS-CoV-1 virus and I think marriage as
*  well. Where, so this is also a problem with vaccines. So like people, like giving the vaccine
*  people's immune response, some people can have that antibody dependent enhancement. And that's
*  what was shown to happen with these, with the SARS-CoV-1. There was some non-human primate
*  studies that did that. And also animal studies as well. So, you know, the thing with monoclonal
*  antibodies, is they're a little more specific because you know they neutralize and you're like
*  growing them up. Like you've done all that test as opposed to just letting your immune system do
*  its thing. And then potentially, you know, you may have this like non-neutralizing antibody that
*  could cause problems. But that's kind of the concern. And I know that the vaccine,
*  people that are working on vaccines are working on them. It's like they're concerned, I mean,
*  about that and completely trying to like figure that all out.
*  It's such a strange virus. It almost seems like there's multiple viruses.
*  There are. Yeah. So, I mean, there's, and it's funny that because it's kind of connected to
*  this antibody dependent enhancement, there's been quite a few different like forms, like mutations
*  that have been identified. But two particular in that spike protein region, that's like an important
*  region because antibodies bind there. And because that's the region like that, you know, the virus
*  uses to get into the cell. And so there's been two major like strains that have been identified.
*  And one of them, so it's in the spike region and it's an aspartate to glycine mutation. And basically
*  in Asia, in China, the predominant form is the aspartate, the like original quote unquote form.
*  And then in Europe and also in North America, this other form, the glycine mutant,
*  is prominent. And there's been studies that have shown looking at like, okay, looking in parts of
*  Europe, different countries in Europe that have this predominant form, that they're basically,
*  there's a higher mortality rate, but they didn't actually measure the infected patients. So,
*  you know, it's kind of like correlation. But what's interesting is that there's actually been a
*  genetic link to this mutant. So there's studies, there's been some large scale genetic studies that
*  have found that Asians, about 20% of Asians have basically a nucleotide change in a gene
*  that encodes for a protease that's involved in this, you know, basically in allowing this virus
*  to get into the cell. But that basically prevents them from having this mutant that's predominant
*  in Europe and also in New York and North America in general. That's interesting because my friend
*  Michael who got it, his mom who got it, who's in her 70s is Asian. And she kicked it in a day.
*  That is interesting. So there's something, so there, I wonder if she has that SNP. So we,
*  we, we're, our genetic report that we have, like we've got one that's like a new viral report,
*  it's a free one, where we're kind of like putting some of these interesting SNPs, which don't mean
*  anything. I mean, like, you know, it's just information that, you know, it was interesting.
*  There's a lot of researchers out there trying to like figure out if genetics is involved in this.
*  But the thing that's so interesting about that mutation is that the, it's in that spike region
*  and it's where the antibody binds and there's a, there's like a theory going around because that
*  specific region, it's been shown in SARS-CoV-1 to cause antibody dependent enhancement. So there's
*  the theory that potentially that mutation is causing people's immune system to hyper activate
*  and basically become more active and it can be, lead to a more severe COVID-19 illness. That's
*  not been shown. Like it's not been shown at all. So, but it's interesting, right? It's interesting
*  how in Asia and China, particularly, I mean, about 1% of the population, it's like less than 1% has
*  the other mutation, the glycine mutation that's in New York, it's in, you know, in most of the
*  United States, but that, that in less than 1% of the population in China has that form.
*  So weird. And Japan has a very low mortality rate, correct?
*  Yeah, they do. I know that that, I was mentioning that TB vaccine, that's one thing that they're
*  investigating. I mean, there's all sorts of differences in handling the whole, you know,
*  from the beginning, just how you, how you handle the virus. I mean, I, like, there's, there's too
*  many factors to like say one thing, but, you know, there's, there's lots of, there's lots of
*  possibilities. And I think that, that, I think that eventually there's going to be therapeutics
*  that are identified, you know, that multiple ones maybe, and I think vitamin D is going to potentially
*  play a role there. But I mean, just like things like remdesivir and, you know, monoclonal antibodies,
*  and then you eventually like, you know, a vaccine will, you know, eventually, you know, be, be
*  available. But I think until that, until that point, I do think that things will be identified
*  that just kind of help us like, deal with this, like better, you know. What is going on with blood
*  types? One of the things we talked about earlier, you asked my blood type and I said O positive.
*  Why is O positive better? Well, there's, there's been some data, and this was also with identified
*  with SARS-CoV-1, that people with type O blood, they, they make antibodies, they make type A
*  antibodies, whereas people with type A blood, they make antibodies against, like they make
*  against the B antigen. And so the type A antibodies were identified. So there's been studies looking
*  at people with type O blood or type, type A blood, and also type B. And type O blood, there's like
*  less, less frequency of getting COVID-19. So as opposed to having a severe form, it's just like,
*  you're less likely to contract it even. And it's thought because the type A antibodies that people
*  with type O blood make neutralize the, they basically bind to that region, that spike region,
*  and neutralize the antibody and prevent it from the virus from entering the cell. So that's,
*  at least that was the mechanism that was shown with SARS-CoV-1. So it's thought, oh, well, the
*  same, we're seeing the same, you know, pattern where people with type O are protected from SARS-CoV-2.
*  Possibly that's, that's also why. But another really interesting thing is that people with type
*  O blood, we were also talking about these like blood clots and like, I mean, there's all kinds
*  of crazy things you read. I mean, I'm reading all these publications, just, and then the other thing
*  is all these publications are being uploaded on, you know, before they're peer reviewed. And I mean,
*  some of them are just a mess. And it's just anyways, but you know, you kind of just take it
*  with the grain of salt. Where these clots are like, you know, there's clots in people that are
*  healthy and young, certainly people that have severe cases, people like older people, people that
*  are pre-existing conditions and stuff. And the type O blood, people have lower levels of this Vaughan
*  Willebrand factor, which basically is involved in clotting. And it's been shown that that Vaughan
*  Willebrand factor also is involved, like is higher, it's higher in people with SARS-CoV-2.
*  It was shown also be that with SARS-CoV-1 and it's involved with clotting. So having lower levels
*  may somehow even help protect against, that's a theory. It hasn't been shown, but what is known
*  is that people with type O blood are less susceptible to contracting COVID-19. That's definitely known.
*  But I mean, I think there's so many things, there's just, there's so many factors that-
*  A lot of data that needs to be parsed out, right?
*  For sure. I mean, a lot of data that needs to be parsed out, a lot of data that needs to be
*  generated. And, you know, we need higher quality data, we need, you know,
*  you know, people to repeat stuff. I mean, like, look what's happened with this hydroxychloroquine
*  stuff, right? I mean, it's just kind of a mess where initially it seemed like it could be helpful
*  and then just more and more studies came out where it was not only not helpful, it was,
*  you know, toxic. It was causing people to have dangerous arrhythmias and stuff.
*  You know, so that's kind of the reason to kind of be cautious when you have something new in
*  a small one small study. It just seems like in the beginning, at least, they're trying to figure out
*  what the correct treatment was for these people as they were just showing up en masse in the
*  emergency rooms. And they didn't really know and doctors, they varied in how they approached it.
*  My friend Michael, his doctor didn't put him on a ventilator. And he said, if I put him on a
*  ventilator, he's probably going to die. Right. Because he said his body's going to stop working
*  because it's going to let the ventilator do the breathing for him and it's going to give up.
*  And what he was talking about, after the fact, what Michael was talking about was how that is
*  proven to be correct in New York and that some monstrous number like 80% of the people that put
*  on ventilators wind up dying. Not just New York. I like I've had friends that are physicians that
*  have like, you know, in New Orleans, I mean, same thing, where it's like, you know, I there was
*  someone on my team, we were looking, we were doing some research on this. And I didn't sort
*  of dive into the whole thing. But he was he was telling me that ventilators do actually like cause
*  more damage to the lungs. And like, like he'd been reading some studies to like confirm that.
*  And he was pretty certain that that ventilators actually cause damage and actually could like
*  induce damage, where it's like making it worse. So that's so hard. I don't know. I don't know all
*  the specifics of that. All I know is that it looking at the statistics, like if you go on
*  a ventilator, I mean, surely it seems like the outcomes not very, it doesn't seem like it's
*  going to be very good. Right. And it's hard to say is that the cause of it or is it right? You know,
*  they're so fucked up by the time they get on a ventilator, they just wind up dying.
*  Right. Well, here, like the the there's been some really interesting data looking at like in the
*  there's some in the Philippines, and Indonesia. Where else? No, I think New Orleans as well.
*  They've looked at patients that have died, and their vitamin D levels and in basically like in
*  the Philippines, you know, people that for like every standard deviation increase in vitamin D
*  levels serum vitamin D levels, you know, the people had like an 8% or were eight fold,
*  eight times less likely to have a severe form of COVID-19. And if they had, and they were 20 times
*  less likely to have critical, like critical form of COVID-19. Whoa. In the in the so that was the
*  Philippines. In the Indonesia was a really interesting study where like they measured vitamin D. And this
*  was measured in the patients. There's been some vitamin D studies also where they're like looking
*  at, you know, countries that have been affected the worst and they all like have low vitamin D.
*  And it's like, okay, well, anyways, that's correlation. But well, so is this. But a little
*  it's a little stronger data that in the in Indonesia, patients that died 90, almost 100%. It
*  was like 98 point something percent of patients that died with COVID-19 were vitamin D deficient.
*  4% of patients that died from COVID-19 were vitamin D sufficient or say 4% only 4% were vitamin D
*  sufficient. So basically they're all vitamin D deficient all the ones that are dying. Whoa, crazy,
*  right? And like New Orleans had some crazy crazy number would be the mechanism that would cause
*  that. So I think there's all right, can we can we get into vitamins? Please do. It's a big I really
*  think because of you, I take 5000 I use a day. Awesome. Right now I'm taking 5000 I use a day.
*  You know, 70% of the US population has insufficient vitamin D levels, which is
*  considered less than blood levels less than 30 milligrams nanograms per milliliter.
*  Your body can generate naturally if you're exposed to the sun on a daily basis. Yes,
*  that's the best way to get it. It is. But the problem is, is that we don't go outside anymore.
*  And you know, now, yeah, exactly. Yeah, now more than ever, but even terrible recipe, right?
*  Vitamin D deficiency is what makes it worse. And then you're staying inside. So you're not
*  getting any vitamin D. Yeah, you're becoming even more deficient, you know, like, like,
*  somewhere like 28% of the US population is actually deficient, like less than 20 nanograms per milliliter,
*  you know, like that's defined deficiency. So there's a lot of people in the United States.
*  As you mentioned, you make it from the sun. So particularly UVB radiation, there's a reason why
*  I want to talk about this. You make it from UVB radiation exposure, you know, basically, you're,
*  it's made in the skin. And, but you know, there's certain times of the year, depending on where you
*  live in a more northern latitude, where that UVB isn't even hitting the atmosphere, you're not making
*  vitamin D. Also, if you have darker skin, melanin protects you like the whole, you know, people with
*  darker skin, people from maybe Africa or India or South Asia, they're more equatorial regions,
*  they're closer, you know, closer to the equator, and there's more UVB radiation throughout the year.
*  And so as a protective mechanism to not get burned, you have melanin, which protects you,
*  right? The problem is, is that melanin also blocks your ability to produce vitamin D. But if you're
*  out in the sun, all the time, you know, in a place where you're getting UVB radiation, it's not
*  problem. Well, this is the very reason why people in places like Scotland and England have such pale
*  skin. Exactly. It's cloudy all the time. So your body sort of develops its own ability to absorb
*  more vitamin D. Exactly. So what happens when you take some what happens when you take a person
*  from from South Asia, from India, from Africa, and you put them in Sweden or in Minnesota or in the UK,
*  and a place where UVB radiation doesn't hit most of the year, and you don't give them a supplement,
*  what happens is they become severely vitamin D deficient severely. And what happens when you take
*  I mean, I mean, you can throw this on the you can flip flip this over and say, Okay, what happens
*  when you take the guy from the UK, the Brit and put them in Australia, like without any sunscreen
*  or without a hat or cancer? They're gonna Yeah, so I mean, do you think that this could be a factor
*  in why so many African Americans are getting hit so hard? So here's the thing. So African Americans
*  are there's lots of all right. African Americans are in the United States, there's been studies,
*  African Americans are severely deficient. They're 28 times more deficient in vitamin D than,
*  than Caucasians. Whoa, yeah. And it's it's it's because it's because they have darker skin. And
*  you know, if they're not getting enough sun, they're not getting enough sun because
*  people stay inside more people stay inside. You know, it's not it's not like the old days when
*  we were out hunter gatherer and out in the sun all the time. We're in our life. We're inside all the
*  time. We're in school, we're at work in our office in our cubicle. So the CDC, you know, obviously,
*  there's been studies showing that African Americans are more hit, but they didn't really correct for
*  tons of like, other factors because socioeconomic status is important. How other health factors,
*  you know, and but there was a big study just released not long ago from from like the National
*  Office of Statistics in Britain or something like that. I don't know what their official name was,
*  but they released some statistics from England and Wales. And the I don't know what the
*  correct name to say. I mean, the blacks, they are basically living in England and in Wales are four
*  times more likely to die of covid-19 than than whites. When they when they adjusted all that
*  data for socioeconomic status and for other health factors, they were two times more likely to die.
*  So clearly, socioeconomic status and other health factors are playing a role, but there's something
*  else unidentified. And I think it's vitamin D. I think that, you know, so, you know, the vitamin D,
*  like it hasn't vitamin D, I'm not saying that vitamin D is going to prevent you from getting
*  covid-19 or it's a treatment. Although I am involved in a clinical study where we're going
*  to be testing a very small open arm study we can talk about. But, you know, I'm not a physician,
*  I'm a medical doctor. I've never intubated anyone. So don't think I'm saying that. I don't want people
*  to think I'm saying it's a treatment. I just want to it's a hypothesis that needs to be tested. And
*  thankfully, there are clinical trials, randomized controlled trials that are now ongoing and there
*  are some that are recruiting. But just the statistics that you've already listed about vitamin D
*  and the people that have had covid-19, those are insane. It's insane. And also in Sweden,
*  there's a huge population of Somalis that have migrated to Sweden. And they have been identified
*  as being severely vitamin D deficient because a lot of the Somalis have also like, like autism
*  rates are really high there. And there's this link between I published a link also between vitamin D
*  and autism. But so there's been studies looking at vitamin D levels in the Somali population. I mean,
*  they are so deficient because you're taking again, you're taking someone who's supposed to be who's,
*  you know, evolved to be getting a lot of sun, but not burn from it. And then and then putting them
*  in a place where they can't get any vitamin D from the sun. And if they don't get a supplement,
*  like they're going to be deficient, you know, and they're so much more likely they're like,
*  it's wreaking havoc in Sweden on the Somali population. So logical. Yeah, it's it's it's
*  and then okay, so elderly, elderly are like insanely more deficient. I forgot the exact number.
*  Obese also obese people are like, three times more likely to be vitamin deficient in the United
*  States. Why is that? Because vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin. And it's less it's been shown to
*  be 50% less bioavailable. So you have to after you make it in your skin, it's stored in fat.
*  And you know, it's released when you know, basically into the bloodstream and then it can
*  gets converted into a hormone. This hormone regulates 5% more than 5% of the human protein
*  encoded human genome. That's a lot of gene. That's a it's a hormone. Like, can you imagine just
*  walking around without testosterone? You're a man. That's a hormone. I mean, like, because there's
*  a lot of people that are deficient in vitamin D. It's a steroid hormone, it gets converted into
*  a hormone. Like, this isn't just a vitamin, you know, it's important. It's really important.
*  So I went off on a tangent. But anyways, what can I ask you this? Why we're often as tangent?
*  What is when you what is happening to people when they are vitamin D? Like what's happening in vitamin
*  D deficient? What is happening in the body that's causing their immune system this this hormone
*  deficiency not having this vitamin D, whether it's through sun exposure, lots of things. I mean, it
*  plays a there's vitamin D receptors on like your immune cells. And the reason for that is because
*  when the hormone vitamin D hormone binds to the receptor, it activates all these genes and that
*  the genes do stuff that are, you know, regulate immune function. You know, there's there's studies
*  that have shown people and I love these studies because because they basically take away people's
*  complaints about, you know, there's lots of epidemiological studies showing that low vitamin
*  D is associated with disease X, Y or Z. And everyone's like, well, you know, they're out in
*  this, they're not in the sun as much. So they're not as healthy. They're not as physically active.
*  They're not whatever, even though those confounding factors are usually corrected for. It's all at the
*  end of the day, it's an association, right? And everyone's like, correlations on causation,
*  which is true. But sometimes you got to like look at the full body of data, you know,
*  their genetic polymorphism. So so there are people that have variations in genes that cause them to
*  genetically have lower vitamin D. And so this this is called Mendelian randomization, when you
*  can take a person that's that has a genetically like it's their genetically low vitamin D. So
*  you're not categorizing them based on their vitamin D levels, you're categorizing them based on their
*  gene. And those people are more likely to die from respiratory infections, just based on that gene
*  alone. So yeah, that gene that it's known to lower it lowers vitamin, it leads to lower vitamin D
*  levels. And so like those people are more likely to die from respiratory infections than people
*  that don't have that which it's a great way of kind of randomizing people by their genes as opposed
*  to doing a randomized control trial. Those have been done as well. There was a study that was over
*  25 randomized control trials, people that were given a vitamin D supplement varying doses either
*  weekly or daily monthly didn't work. They're the people with low baseline vitamin D levels,
*  so people that were like deficient, they were 50% less likely to have a respiratory tract infection
*  if they were taking the vitamin D supplement, over 50%, actually. And people that had already
*  normal levels still had a protective effect, there was 10% less likely. So even people that
*  were already considered normal, taking a vitamin D supplement helped prevent the respiratory tract.
*  Can you take too much vitamin D? Yes, you can, you can. So too much. So right, so the upper the
*  tolerable upper intake has been set by the nutrition board, the Institute of Medicine to
*  be 4000 IUs a day. But there's been studies that have shown that you can, I mean, people that have
*  taken, you know, 10,000 IUs a day for multiple years haven't had any hypercalcemia or had, you
*  know, problems. But too much vitamin D can be toxic, it's not good to take that. It's best to
*  get a vitamin D blood test. And I think that personally, there has been a trend, so people
*  that have blood levels higher than 60 may have just a little bit higher calcium level, but not
*  much, not like, it's not like anything to be hugely concerned about. But there are studies also showing
*  that either vitamin K1, so there's been a meta analysis looking at 12 different studies, I think,
*  where vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 were given and both of those improved bone mineral density and
*  prevented any hypercalcemia. Because when you take vitamin D, you absorb calcium better, like
*  something crazy, like 40% more dietary calcium is being absorbed. So the problem is, is that
*  calcium can easily form a precipitate in general, and particularly when phosphorus is around.
*  And phosphorus is another thing vitamin D does increase the absorption of. But again, like I said,
*  you know, it's really hard to find any studies where vitamin D is causing, you know, hypercalcemia
*  unless it's like really, really high dose for a while. I personally think taking the vitamin K1,
*  and what's interesting about the vitamin K1 versus vitamin K2 without going into too much of a
*  tangent is basically the vitamin K1, normally it goes to your liver and it's involved in blood
*  coagulation. But when there's enough vitamin K1 around, it stays in the periphery and it moves
*  calcium, periphery being bloodstream, it moves calcium out of the bloodstream and takes it to
*  places where it's supposed to go, like the bones and the muscle. Vitamin K2 usually stays around
*  the periphery, doesn't really go to the liver. So that's usually what it's just doing is,
*  you know, moving calcium out and bringing it to the bones. And so I take a, I actually have K1 in
*  my multi that I take, but I also take a K2 supplement, MK4, I take it like a couple times
*  a week. And what dose you're taking for K1? Well, the K1 is in my multi, so I don't, vitamin K1 is
*  really, it's found in dark leafy greens. So I get a lot of those as well. I get a lot. So I'm getting
*  a lot of K1. Vitamin K2 is not as, it's not as readily found in like the Western, I mean,
*  it's like the food that's highest in it is that fermented soybean natto, but it's like small
*  quantities and like, do you ever get concerned from the high volume of leafy greens? Do you ever
*  get conservative oxalates or getting kidney stones or anything along those lines? No, I like the few
*  studies that I've seen is and people that are like doing insane juicing and they're already like
*  messed up, you know, so I'm not concerned at all. Like even like the oxalates, oxalates actually,
*  I don't want to go into this, but so yeah, no, I don't concern, just concern. I want the vitamin D
*  thing is so important to me. Like the, the, the reason there's a big reason I think that vitamin D
*  is so important. It's for the lung function and the respiratory function. But what's really
*  interesting is that, you know, the, the very receptor that this SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to,
*  to gain entry into the cell, it's called ACE2. That very receptor plays a really important role
*  in preventing lung damage and, and basically in preventing acute lung injury, preventing acute
*  respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. And what's been shown with SARS-CoV-1 is that, because SARS-CoV-1
*  also binds to that receptor ACE2, it's called, and that's how it gets into the cell, just like
*  the SARS-CoV-2. When, when it binds the receptor, it like, it attaches in like through this like
*  weird endocytosis mechanism, it takes the receptor in and decreases the receptor, what's called
*  downregulates. Downregulates receptors so you end up having less ACE2, which causes like, can cause
*  severe lung injury, not having the ACE2. It plays a big role in protecting. That's been shown in
*  multiple studies. Like, so the SARS-CoV-1 virus does that. It's thought the SARS-CoV-2 also does
*  it because it goes through the same, enters through the same receptor. And it's been shown that like,
*  if you, for example, if you give mice, lipopolysaccharide or something that's going to cause
*  lung injury, and then you give them vitamin D. So the lung injury itself also causes the ACE2
*  receptor to decrease. And it's like this vicious cycle of like making the damage worse. But if you
*  give mice vitamin D before that happens, the ACE2 receptor increases and it protects them from the
*  lung injury. But you give the vitamin D to control mice that don't have the lung injury, it doesn't
*  do anything to the ACE2 receptor levels. So it's not like full stop, it's not like, you know, drugs,
*  the way drugs are designed is they like, they target a certain molecule and they boom, they
*  like do their thing, they either increase it or decrease it. A lot of times with like hormones,
*  you know, vitamins, things like that, they maintain homeostasis. You know what I mean?
*  So when shit goes wrong, they fix it. They're not just like, boom, full stop going to like
*  increase something when everything's normal. So and that's important because there have been
*  some concern about taking vitamin D, increasing the ACE2 receptor. And there's another study that
*  was with hypertensive rats, where the hypertension caused ACE2 to go down and that like makes lung,
*  it makes all sorts of problems. It also causes like kidney problems and all sorts of things, right?
*  But the vitamin D increased the ACE2, but only in the hypertensive rats, not in the normal control
*  rats again. So, you know, and then there was another study that was like some other messed up
*  diabetic animal model where the vitamin D actually didn't increase the ACE2 receptor,
*  but it increased what's called soluble ACE2, which is in like, it's in the periphery. And that actually
*  potentially could bind SARS-CoV-2 virus and prevent it from, it's like sequestering it,
*  preventing it from entering the cell. That's actually being explored as a potential therapeutic. So
*  the bottom line here is that sometimes you'll hear this ACE2 receptor and that's how the virus
*  gets in. And it's like, I don't want that. I want less of that because that's how the virus gets in.
*  But like, biology is always way more complicated than just a simple taking it out of a big picture,
*  right? You know, so like the ACE2 receptor, the ACE2 is part of the renin angiotensin system. It
*  plays a huge role in inflammation. It's also like when you decrease ACE2, all these signaling
*  cascades happen and it's like ACE2 is important for producing pro-inflammatory cytokines at the
*  end of the day without getting into all the stuff, you know, specifics. So it causes massive
*  inflammation to have a decrease. It basically causes acute lung injury. It exacerbates it. I
*  mean, it's crazy. So I really, I just, I really, can you imagine if vitamin D really did help?
*  Like if there was something that could be given along with the other stuff from Dezivir, whatever,
*  whatever it's going to be, the stuff that we identify, but like vitamin D is so cheap,
*  it's so easy and so many people are deficient and insufficient, you know, like so yes, as you
*  mentioned, there is, you know, you don't want to take too much vitamin D. You don't want to like,
*  you know, overdose on it. But I think in the short term, you know, particularly like in the short
*  term and particularly in patients, people that have already been infected, you know, it may be
*  wise to try giving your patient, like if you're a physician, you know, dealing with this, maybe
*  wise to try and see their vitamin D levels and perhaps give them some, you know. Is this being
*  explored? I mean, is this something that people are talking about publicly? Because I, all I'm
*  hearing is drugs and possible drug remedies, potential vaccine that they're working on in the
*  future. I'm not hearing anything about methods, nutrition that boosts your immune system. This
*  is one of the reasons why I really wanted to talk to you right now. Yeah, let's definitely talk more.
*  There are, yes, it is. So there are clinical studies, unfortunately, not a ton of them in
*  the United States that are looking, randomized controlled trials looking at vitamin D, the effects
*  of vitamin D on already, you know, patients with COVID-19, which what would be great is like giving
*  them to like first responders or healthcare workers and seeing like how does it, how does it, what
*  role does it play in prevention? Because that's really the easiest thing, right? I'm involved,
*  a friend of mine, Dr. Eric Gordon, he's put together. So I kind of, with his help, I've
*  helped him design an open arm trial, very small, 40 patients, where he is going to be giving them
*  50,000 IUs every five days of vitamin D. So it's like a weekly dose. Because a lot of times these
*  people are severely deficient. So you want to give them a higher dose, you know. And for, you know,
*  doing 50,000 IUs weekly isn't, you know, something that's necessarily going to be toxic or anything
*  like that. And then we're going to, you know, we're doing some other things, vitamin C, three grams,
*  three times a day, and then vitamin B1, we can talk about that, thiamine as well. But so yeah,
*  there are, I think there's like open label trial, open label trials are just kind of a start. It's
*  like, if you if you see something, plus we're doing like kitchen sink, right, we got this, this, and
*  this, and this. So I think vitamin D really is the is the star, you know, I think that potentially,
*  you know, I think it really should be explored. I think it has huge potential, it has to be shown,
*  like this isn't something that people can just, you know, take it home and think I'm protected,
*  like that is not the case. We don't know that, like, you know, there's no data showing that. But I
*  think it has huge potential, you know, so how would one do a randomized control study on vitamin D
*  and people that have COVID-19? Like, it seems like well, they're going to do it in addition to
*  in addition to standard of care. So it's basically whatever the standard of care is, and that's
*  that's what, you know, is happening at the the 100 and hospital in New Jersey. But as you said,
*  it seems like what's really critical is getting it to people before they get it.
*  Yeah, I would love to see that study done. If anyone can do that study. Amazing. That would be
*  because that would be like, to get it to nurses, get it to first responders. Yeah, workers,
*  or even just get the information out there and have nurse or nurses and first responders take it.
*  I mean, you know, vitamin D is something again, like 70% of the US population has insufficient
*  levels, you know, that is such a crazy number. It is. And it's generally safe to take like,
*  like 4000 I use a day. It is taking five. I am but 4000 is the top, the what they indicated as
*  the tolerable upper intake. So why do you take five? I'm just taking 5000 right now because that's
*  like the I could buy the five times like I didn't want to take two pills of the 2000.
*  Well, that's me too. I got one pill. It's 5000. And I'm like, well,
*  so I had my my levels measured, literally, like I went to quest, quest labs,
*  like a month before all this lockdown happened. So I got my data back pretty, pretty recent. And
*  I still hover around 50 nanograms per mil, even though before I was taking 4000, it didn't.
*  Generally speaking, 1000 I use will raise your blood levels by about five nanograms per mil.
*  And there are people with different variations in genes that are related to vitamin D metabolism,
*  where they have lower levels and they need a higher dose. The only way you're going to know
*  that is by of course, measuring your vitamin D levels multiple times, and then potentially
*  even doing like a genetic analysis, you know, as well. But you have to measure your levels,
*  like that's the only way to know. Of course, right now, it's like you can't go to allow it's
*  like hard to do any of that. I mean, the things that are like, yeah, but right now when you need
*  it, but the vitamin D, I mean, I'm just so like, I just I have so much I have high hopes for it,
*  you know, and maybe maybe I'm a bit of an enthusiast with it. You know, I do like I've studied
*  vitamin D so much. I've got two publications on it. I certainly like, you know, you said, so you
*  know, there take that with a grain of salt as well. But I just think the data is strong. I really
*  think the data is, I think it's mounting data. And I think that eventually something will come
*  out and it's going to just like the randomized controlled trials, showing that it protects
*  against respiratory tract infections, for everyone wants randomized controlled trials, like no one
*  wants to believe anything until it's a randomized control trial. I'm just I'm amazed that the
*  numbers of people that are deficient. It's so stunning. And when you point out the number
*  of people that are deficient that actually wind up having severe COVID-19 problems, right? Yeah,
*  I know. It's stunning. Like some of those numbers like the missing link. It's like it's right there.
*  I think that's a really good hypothesis. I do. I think it's a really good hypothesis. I want to
*  believe it because it's easy. It's safe. And I think people need vitamin D anyways. I mean,
*  you know, so so of course, I want to believe it, you know. But like, there was this interesting
*  study where African Americans who are very deficient in vitamin D, they were given a vitamin D
*  supplement for like a month, and it decreased their epigenetic age by like two years. I mean,
*  yeah, so that's a marker of month, something like a month, I think. Yeah, in a month, they decrease
*  their epigenetic age by two years. Okay, don't hold me to the month. Give me some month or two
*  months. But I think it was a month. Most most three months. That's crazy. Most of these studies are
*  about a month. Yeah. So yeah, by 1.8 years. So what it's indicative of their suffering from this
*  vitamin D deficiency. This alleviates that suffering and then puts the body in homeostasis.
*  It's a hormone. Yeah, hormone. It's changing 5% of the human genome. That's a lot. That's a lot.
*  It's a lot. Yeah. It's a crazy number. When you think about it. It is. And it's not just a vitamin,
*  right? Yeah. Hormone. Super vitamin. Can you imagine? It's like, what happens when you go
*  into menopause? Well, you're not making your estrogen. I mean, stuff goes wrong. I mean,
*  it's a hormone like estrogen. Estrogen is a hormone. You know, testosterone is a hormone.
*  It's a hormone. You know, it's, it's, it's important. So, you know, so that's the, if you have
*  the Dr. Rhonda Patrick pyramid of supplementation for preventative symptoms of COVID-19 or
*  preventative measures dealing with COVID-19. That's your base. That's number one. I take vitamin D.
*  I certainly don't know if it's going to prevent COVID-19, but I'm hoping it does. Yes. I take it
*  hoping it, but I'm not even saying preventative. I mean, like keeping your body healthy. I mean,
*  my mom, I've got my mom, I got my dad, I got my whole family. Everyone's on the routine. You know,
*  vitamin D is like the most important. So that's the foundation is vitamin D right now. Yeah. I mean,
*  I'm always trying to get them to have that, but like, it's easier to convince when people are
*  scared. People are more likely to make change when like you can't like if something, they have
*  to be motivated to make the change themselves or just otherwise it doesn't work. You know? So I
*  think that in this case, people are motivated, especially people in my parents' generation that
*  are older because they're, they're more scared. They're more scared that they could be affected
*  by a severe, you know, case of this. Right. So, so I think that's the certainly, you know, the issue.
*  Um, yeah, I mentioned I'm drinking my vitamin C water. Um, it's funny because
*  I've probably got like a thousand questions about vitamin C in the past month to month and a half
*  or whatever. Um, and we kind of like my team and I just dove in and put together an article,
*  released a podcast on it, a video where we just kind of covered everything. I mean,
*  I can't believe how many studies I read on vitamin 190 references in our article, the 28 page article
*  on our website. Um, but vitamin C is interesting too. I mean, I don't, I certainly,
*  the interesting thing about vitamin C is, you know, there, there, there's oral and then there's
*  intravenous vitamin C and the intravenous vitamin C is what's, what's seems to be really relevant
*  right now. Um, but, uh, I think the most interesting thing that I learned really had to do with the,
*  the pharmacokinetics, which is basically like how much vitamin C raises your plasma levels. And like,
*  is, you know, is there a saturation point where you can eat, you know, 20 grams of vitamin C,
*  but still only get to the certain point, you know, and then versus what you do if you like
*  in your, you know, injected into your veins, right. Intervenously. So, um, what's interesting
*  is that most people that are just like eating, let's say that people are just eating like five,
*  somewhere between five to nine servings of vegetables or fruits a day. Those people have
*  anywhere between like 70 to 80 micro mole, micro moles of vitamin C like per liter. So it's micro
*  moles per liter, um, in their blood. If you take like a 200 milligram supplement, you only raise
*  your levels to like 90. So it's not much over that like baseline. Most, most people that aren't
*  eating that many, that's many servings probably have around 50, which is still considered normal,
*  50 micro moles or micro molar. Um, and then what's interesting is that like, but those levels you
*  take, if you take 200 milligrams, it's, it doesn't do much. If you take a gram, it can raise you up
*  to like 130 or something. If you take three grams, it can raise you to 220. And that's like the
*  maximum level you can get from oral supplementation, 220 micro moles. That's big. That's a big
*  difference. 220 versus like 50. So three grams, three grams. But here's the other interesting
*  thing is that if you don't take it multiple times throughout the day, if you only take it once,
*  you'll peak at around five hours after. I think there's like a really nice graph on, on my website
*  on the topic page. It shows this like you'll peak like five, five hours after, but then you go down
*  steadily and over 24 hours, you're back to normal, your baseline. But if you take it like,
*  you know, four times a day, you can stay at 220, like all the whole time. And, and the reason that's
*  important is because a lot of studies looking at oral vitamin C consumption and like for,
*  for instance, the common cold incidents, the common cold really depend, like there's huge
*  variations in the results. And it all really seems to come down to dose. Like it really does. And
*  when you know the dose and how that's changing your blood levels, like if you're only taking 200
*  milligrams, which some studies are doing, it's barely doing anything over your baseline. You
*  know, so I found that really interesting. And then the intravenous vitamin C you can, you can, you
*  can be Mac. I mean, so far, like the maximum I've seen measured is like 70 times that your blood
*  can get 70 times 200. Yeah. So it's like 18,000 or 17,000 or something like that. So IV is
*  far more effective. Oh, it totally overcomes all those like saturateable mechanisms. It's, and it's
*  not only more effective, it's a completely different game. So what can I pause? Yeah. What,
*  what dose do you recommend for intravenous vitamin C? Yeah. For inter Jamie, can you pull up
*  foundmyfitness.com and there's a vitamin C topic page so that way I can answer that question better
*  because there's a, just pull, there's a graph. If you just like scroll to the graph, there's like,
*  and all this is on your website, which tell everybody foundmyfitness.com vitamin C or
*  Oh, that's the episode page. That's the podcast, but scroll back up to the, to the main home. Yeah.
*  So topics click on topics. There we go. Vitamin C somewhere at the bottom. There we go.
*  Okay. There's a, there's just look for the figure scroll. You'll see it.
*  Okay. Great. There it goes. Is there any way you can make that? Yeah. The bottom one is one I want
*  to see. That's the intravenous. Okay. So there we go. So this is intravenous dose. So you, I,
*  you want to get at least 10 grams so you can see 10 grams is like,
*  and 10 grams is 10,000 milligrams. Yeah. 10 grams is 10,000 milligrams. So that's,
*  that's about 10 grams. That's what I've done in the past. But what's interesting is when you get
*  above, oh, that's a pop up newsletter. My newsletter is great. I mean, I, I, I do lots of
*  announcements there. I give commentary, you know, stuff I'm scared to like publish on the website
*  because I don't want to hear all the crap. But anyways, like what are you scared of?
*  Oh no, I'm just like, you know, there's, I'm not scared. I guess that's the wrong word. I just
*  don't want to deal with it. That's the thing. I just don't want to deal with it. The intravenous
*  vitamin C is a completely different game because it literally generates hydrogen peroxide. Like
*  when you get like doses above, you know, when you start to max out over that, you know, plasma level,
*  220 micromole, the vitamin C itself, so vitamin C kind of cycles between being oxidized and reduced.
*  It's called dehydroascorbic acid, dehydroascorbate, and then ascorbic acid or ascorbate.
*  Dehydroascorbic acid is the oxidized form and hydrogen peroxide is generated, which is really
*  interesting because it's one of the mechanisms by which at least it's thought that intravenous
*  vitamin C kills cancer cells. It also has been shown to like kill viruses and stuff in a variety
*  of different studies. But that's interesting because your neutrophils generate hydrogen
*  peroxide. So the intravenous vitamin C is like generating hydrogen peroxide. At the same time,
*  it's also acting as an antioxidant for your own neutrophils and that's been shown. So people,
*  um, you know, in clinical studies, but also it's been shown that the hydrogen peroxide does not
*  damage the normal cells, like normal healthy people, given intravenous vitamin C, it's generating
*  hydrogen peroxide, but there's no oxidative damage happening in people's like lymphocytes and stuff.
*  So it's not like damaging your own cells. And how often would you do this if you could?
*  Well, in study, the studies, you know, it depends on what virus you're looking at. Like, you know,
*  I mean, for you personally, for just for health benefits, how often would you take it? If you
*  just had access to it every day, how often would you take intravenous vitamin C?
*  You know, it's something because if you, if you look at the graph, it's kind of a trans
*  intravenous vitamin C is transient. So it's like, it's having, it's not something that
*  like necessarily needs to be done all the time. It's something like I was, I was interested in
*  doing it. Like my mom was, my mom had just gotten sick and, um, like common cold, you know, she had
*  like a runny nose and stuff. And so I took her, we went to get the, the IVC and they did, it was 10,
*  10 grams that we did. And, um, I took it because I was like, well, she's sick and I've been around
*  her and like, I don't want to get sick. So, you know, I thought, why not try it? And, um, you know,
*  so, so, you know, the intravenous vitamin C, maybe, maybe there's like a reason to do it,
*  but it's not something that I'm certain that people need to do on a daily basis. It's different
*  than like vitamin C, you know, normal vitamin C you do need, you need to get it from your diet.
*  It's important. Like it's important for normal immune cells, um, normal immune function. And
*  that's been shown. Um, but I, but I don't, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but do you believe it's
*  important to take it orally as well as IV? Well, the IV is, it's, it's totally, the IV is totally
*  different. Um, the IV is really being used as a therapeutic treatment. Like it's, it's, it's,
*  it's a therapeutic treatment more, you know, the, the, the IBC where it's been shown to help with
*  like, for example, it's, it's, at least in the hospitals in San Diego, it's routinely used for
*  sepsis. Um, like friends of mine, you know, use that, use it for treating sepsis. And there's been
*  large randomized controlled trials showing that it dramatically reduces mortality with sepsis. Um,
*  so like that's a, and especially in combination with thiamine as well, like huge differences in,
*  in mortality, people dying from sepsis, which is obviously very relevant now, but hasn't been
*  shown. I mean, there are clinical studies that are, are ongoing right now, some in China and some of
*  the United States looking at IBC potentially to help treat, um, COVID-19 associated pneumonia.
*  You know, the, it'll be interesting to see the data from those trials, whether or not there's
*  going to be an effect. It's not known, but, um, the fact that it has been shown to, to treat,
*  to improve sepsis outcomes in, in multiple studies, it's also been shown obviously cancer
*  is like a big one. Like that was like, you know, Linus Pauling was like deemed a nut, like, you
*  know, the Nobel prize winning chemist who basically is the vitamin C guy. Like he back in the seventies
*  was like championing intravenous vitamin C for, for, for cancer patients. Cause he was claiming it
*  was like, you know, curing them, quote unquote, curing them. I wasn't quite doing that, but it
*  was like improving the outcomes of cancer patients. And there's all these studies from
*  the Mayo clinic came out and they were like, Nope, doesn't do that. Turned out they were using oral
*  vitamin C, which is like comparing apples to oranges, you know? So, but now there's been so
*  many studies a lot, you know, how's the Mayo clinic fucked that up? I don't know. They did.
*  That's so crazy. They did. Yeah. Yeah. They were doing, but that's who you would depend upon when
*  you wanted to know, well, is this accurate? I mean, this was decades ago. I don't know. Maybe
*  they've like, they've, they've definitely like gotten there, gotten more on game since then.
*  They just didn't understand the difference. Yeah. Who knows back then, you know, the
*  pharmacokinetic studies that I'm referring to, I mean, those aren't, those are brief. Mark Levine
*  at the NIH, he's real, like he gets credit, like he is really, really involved in putting that out
*  there. Like the difference between intravenous vitamin C and oral are apples and oranges,
*  completely different. Like, and so until that was known, I guess maybe the Mayo clinic,
*  they just thought, oh, vitamin C is vitamin C. You just can take it orally. And until like
*  some of that data started coming out, the pharmacokinetic data where it was like, no,
*  it's not the same thing. Like you're talking about 70 times higher vitamin C levels in the plasma.
*  Like you could never do that from oral. Like it's not the same at all. Before that was known,
*  I guess maybe that that's why. I've even heard people dismiss vitamin C saying that your body
*  only absorbs a certain amount and it's wasted if you take more than that. Well, you do. So here's
*  the thing. Like, so, so maximum bioavailability does occur at 200 milligrams. And once you go
*  above that, like when you, if you take 500 milligrams of vitamin C orally, you start to
*  excrete a lot in urine, but that doesn't, if you look at the plasma levels, you're still increasing
*  them much higher. You're excreting more too, but you're, you're increasing your plasma levels more.
*  So you, so you take 200 milligrams, you get your plasma levels of vitamin C up to 90.
*  You take 500, you may get it a little bit more. You take three grams, you get it to 220. Yeah,
*  you're going to be peeing a lot out, but you got to 220. Right. And so if you look at these,
*  these common cold studies, there's like randomized meta analysis, randomized control trials,
*  analysis of them. They've shown that like, you know, two grams is better than one gram for,
*  for like, um, reducing the duration of the common cold. Uh, two grams is better than one and, uh,
*  children are more, have a more robust effect than adults. So like adults, like it reduces
*  the common cold. Like two grams can do something like 20% reduce the duration by like 20% or
*  something. And it's children emergency that company got a lot of shit for their claims.
*  And the claims grams, I said two grams emergency doesn't have nothing. So, so then you keep 200
*  milligrams or something. So you keep looking down, there's more meta analysis, another meta
*  analysis that looked at, um, 200 milligrams up to like 200 milligrams up to two grams.
*  And that study kind of just lumped everything together rather than the other study, like,
*  okay, what happens is two grams and one, and they did all these sub analysis and that was great
*  because they like got to the bottom of it dose matters. The other study, it was like, oh, it,
*  it reduces the duration by like 4%, you know, basically nothing. So, so there's like all this,
*  there was all these conclusions. It doesn't do anything. Well, yeah, 200 milligrams. Look
*  at that graph. It does, it doesn't do shit to your plasma levels. Like you're still at baseline.
*  So I think that people designing clinical studies, like they need, like that needs to be in their
*  mind before they design their trial. Okay. What am I trying to measure here? Like I want to get,
*  I need to, like, I need a measurable, like I need something to measure. I need that to change,
*  right? To get an outcome. Like if you want, you're trying to like see what effect vitamin C has on
*  whatever outcome, you're going to want to wait, raise someone's plasma levels. Right? So I guess
*  it's good at the end of the day to know that 200 milligrams doesn't do anything because then you
*  go, okay, well, 200 milligrams doesn't do anything. But it's also good to know that, oh, wait,
*  if I take a higher dose, there is an effect. So, you know, making this general statement that,
*  oh, vitamin C supplementation doesn't do anything is not necessarily, it's accurate in some respects.
*  Yeah. 200 milligrams, it doesn't do much for the common cold, but when you take two grams,
*  it can help. And also other studies have shown that prophylactically is slightly better than like
*  therapeutic. So like after the onset of symptoms, so if you do it like before symptoms, like there's
*  a better, you know, outcome as well. So I mean, that's all kinds of interesting. So for you
*  personally, if you had the option, would you do it once a week? Ivy? It's pretty interesting. Yeah,
*  I've like I was doing it. I was actually doing it once a week before shelter in place. That's enough?
*  Once a week is enough? Totally. I don't even know if it's necessary, honestly, to be honest,
*  because again, it's a therapeutic treatment. I will say this, like my one of my friends,
*  she's a she's an M.D. and she has reactive airways. There's interesting studies that have shown,
*  you know, like that intravenous vitamin C is like dramatically reducing inflammation as well. It's
*  doing all kinds of crazy things, but her cough and it was very transient. It only happened like while
*  the IV while the vitamin C was high in her plasma. She's got this crazy cut. I mean, you'd think
*  she'd had covid. It's just like a constant nagging cough, you know, that it completely
*  100 percent went away. I noticed it and she like my friend is a little bit, you know, she's a little
*  bit of a skeptic when it comes to like vitamins or anything like that. You know, so I wasn't going
*  to say anything because her and I have gone in so many debates about it. So but she said something
*  and I was just like, you know, I'm so glad. And so she now she's wanting to do it like she's wanting
*  to do it like, you know, once a month at least. So I thought that was, you know, interesting.
*  Again, I don't know that the intravenous vitamin C is necessary. There's also interesting effects on
*  like fat oxidation. Like it affects fat oxidation because it's important for carnitine, which is
*  necessary for oxidizing fat. Like there's been clinical studies where people are like burning
*  more fat when they're exercising. If they have vitamin C and if they have low vitamin C levels
*  are not like burning as much fat. And I think it's because it's the carnitine. I thought that was
*  really interesting. I didn't know anything about that. So we've been doing intravenous vitamin C
*  and glutathione and a bunch of other stuff. Zinc once a week. That's what we've been doing.
*  OK. Zinc is another one that's really, you know, important for immune function as well.
*  And elderly people are more zinc deficiency is not really common in the U.S. Most, you know, zinc is
*  found in it's really high in oysters, but not a lot of people with oysters. Red meat poultry,
*  you know, if you eat enough of that, you should be getting enough zinc. What about vegetarians?
*  Vegetarians do. They are more prone to zinc deficiency. And in fact, because the zinc is
*  bound to phytate, it's less bioavailable and they need to like eat like up to three times more.
*  The RDA needs to be like almost three times as high for them or they can just supplement,
*  which I know a lot of vegetarians do. But yeah, zinc zinc is really important for immune function.
*  Like there's been studies where they've like depleted healthy people of their zinc just
*  transiently and like T cell function like is all messed up. So it like totally messes the
*  immune system up. Randomized control trials showing that zinc, zinc acetate or zinc gluconate,
*  like lozenges, they can dramatically lower the duration of common cold. So
*  is acetate or gluconate, which one's superior? So there was it's like it was trending that
*  acetate was better trending, meaning it was non significant. Although it was like 40% versus 28%.
*  Like, to me, lowering lowering the duration of the common cold by 40% versus lowering it by 28%,
*  I guess it was non significant for whatever reason. So they're saying it's the study concluded that
*  they're both the same, but it seems as though acetate may be slightly better, maybe slightly
*  better. But you know, that I am taking zinc, zinc is also a positive ion. So you need a zinc
*  ionophore to help it get in to cells. So like choirs flavonoids like quercetin, quercetin is found
*  in like apples, onions, buckwheat teas, which is what I drink. But you can supplement with it,
*  which I also supplement. Yeah, I supplement with it as well. It's questions interesting,
*  because it's a zinc ionophore. It's also been identified to have activity against SARS-CoV-1.
*  Antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-1. Doesn't it have nootropic properties as well?
*  I don't know. It has. I don't know. It might be confusing with something else. It's got
*  senolytic properties, which means it's been shown it's been identified as a possible
*  compound that can clear out senescent cells, which are those cells that are, you know,
*  they accumulate with age. And they're basically like, they're not dead, but they're just like,
*  not really functioning. And they're secreting, they're secreting cytokines and things that
*  age in your bicelles. I always like to think of like, I was mentioning to Jamie that I'm
*  maybe 42 next month. And so yeah, I have some gray hairs. Hey, gray hairs. And it's funny how
*  like you'll get one gray hair, and the other gray hairs like cluster around that one, like
*  they're clustering. And I always think of like, because cellular senescence happens in the
*  melanocytes that are responsible for pigment. So I always think about, oh, the senescent
*  melanocyte is like secreting all this pro-inflammatory stuff that's now
*  accelerating the age of my other nearby hair follicle melanocytes and causing them to anyways,
*  quercetin has been identified to clear away senescent cells. So that's kind of cool for aging,
*  for gray hairs, and all just for aging. Now that's just my like, an analogy for people to understand
*  why senescent cells are bad because they like age to other nearby cells by secreting all this stuff,
*  pro-inflammatory. One thing I forgot to ask you about vitamin D deficiency is red light therapy.
*  What would that have to do with vitamin D? I don't know. Do you know about these
*  red light machines that people stand in front of? Yeah, the photo-bio-modulation. Yeah. Does that
*  have any effect on vitamin D? That's not UVB. No. Okay, it's different? Yeah. Yeah. And I think that
*  that itself, it's an interesting field. I would say that the marketing has got a little head of
*  the science for that. But I do think that there's promise, particularly for some treatments. There
*  are some claims out there that are sort of being backed up by very poorly done studies. But I think
*  there's some promise out there for it. It makes you feel good. Does it? Yeah. It's interesting.
*  I've been doing it. I wanted to do it before I even talked about it for a month solid. And I do it
*  basically four or five days a week. And I don't know. It's hard to tell because I do so much shit.
*  Do you sauna? Yes. That makes you feel good. Every day. Every day. I'm doing five days a week.
*  I'm doing seven days a week, 180 degrees for 25 minutes. Dude, I do 180 degrees for 25 minutes.
*  Dude. That's funny. Yeah. Unless it's 190 or 188, then I'll do 20. But yeah, I do 25 at 180 as well.
*  So that seems to me the sweet spot. And I've been doing it every single day of the quarantine
*  because I have a sauna in my house. Do you have a sauna in your house? We do. Well, it's in our
*  office, which is like home office. It's like, well, it's not in our home, but it's just next door
*  pretty much. So we got that literally, you're not going to believe it's like three hours before
*  shelter in place was put into California. I mean, I couldn't believe it. Well, we had ours done just
*  a few months before. I mean, it was just, I was thinking like, God, if we didn't have this in the
*  house and you couldn't go anywhere. Luckily we have one here so I could use the one that's here.
*  But it's a godsend. Oh man. It changes everything. It's a game changer. It's a game changer.
*  And we've I've been doing so I haven't had a warm shower since the shelter in place.
*  Since I got my showers. I do. It's amazing. Like I do. I don't want to make people feel bad. Look,
*  I went a long time without a sauna. I know what it's like. I was doing hot baths and we can talk
*  about that. Yeah, it is. But there is something about the sauna and then the cold bath, the cold
*  shower, sorry, the cold shower. That is just it is a game. Like I am so much more relaxed. And this
*  is like I think I've told you the story. The whole reason I got interested in the sauna was because
*  I was in graduate school doing it like every day. And I was like, this is amazing. I am so much less
*  stressed. I am like calmer, more relaxed. I'm happier. Yeah, something's happening. So I was
*  like into the not even all the muscle and all the cardiovascular. I mean, it mimics cardiovascular
*  exercise. It really has a big difference in my cardiovascular activity. It's been shown to in
*  people. There's a study. This was I think Gary Lalkinen, who's a friend of mine, just he's like
*  the best leader in sauna research in Finland. He published a study where they looked at
*  cardiorespiratory fitness and cardio, I think cardio, other cardiovascular disease risk markers
*  in people that were physically fit or physically sorry, physically active and plus the sauna or,
*  you know, just physically active. So physical or just sauna alone. So physical activity was like
*  the king. So like if you compare physical activity alone to sauna alone, physical activities, the
*  best at improving cardiovascular health. Sauna is also good. Sauna and physical activity together
*  were better than the physical activity alone, which I was like, yes, that's what you want.
*  I don't remember. I was like, you're asking me like six months ago or more.
*  But that's what you want, right? Like you want like, you're like, I'm already physically active.
*  I mean, you're like more physically active than me. And so but that's what you want is like the
*  combination. It makes a big difference. Once I started doing it during the lockdown. One of the
*  things I noticed the runs that I do, the last hill is fucking brutal. And I always finish on this last
*  hill. But now I've been able to run that last hill, the last hill. It's like a market difference.
*  When I hit the hill, I'm like, wow, this is crazy. Either I'm getting in better shape,
*  and I know I am for sure. But it's also, I got to think the sauna has a big impact because it feels
*  like I'm on a drug. It feels like I'm on I don't know what EPOs feels like, but I would imagine it
*  would feel something like this was the increased cardiovascular benefit is very noticeable.
*  Totally, totally. I mean, there's been some small studies looking at you're talking about
*  performance enhancements. There's been some small studies showing that particularly with endurance,
*  that there is a performance enhancement. I think it was cycler. Maybe it was running,
*  running and cycling. Have you ever measured your heart rate during it? So yes. So here's the thing
*  with that. Like, at first, I was like terrified to do that, because I didn't want to ruin my
*  Apple Watch, you know, I've like ruined some things there. And like Kevin, Kevin Rose was like, no,
*  just put your hand on. I do it all the time. And like, like, he's a tech guy. So I'm like, all right,
*  Kevin Rose tells me I can take my Apple Watch in the hot frickin sauna. I'm gonna do it. Right.
*  So, you know, my heart rate, it can get up to like 120. But the thing is, is that there is adaptation
*  that happens. So you're basically like, you're becoming adapted. And so your heart rate doesn't
*  increase as much like over time. And I'll be honest, I stopped wearing my watch in there. So
*  I'm not measuring my heart rate anymore. Like to get a whoop strap, because the whoop strap
*  was no problem at all. Yeah, the whoop strap. W-H-O-O. Yeah, P. I'll get you one. I'll have one sent to you.
*  They're one of the sponsors of the podcast, but I love it. I would love to have something to measure
*  it without having to take my watch in there because I don't like sitting like it's like, you know,
*  well, the whoop strap measures it really well. And it'll give you like you could actually mark
*  it down as an activity and it'll show you where your heart rate it's a it's got a mountain of data.
*  It's really good. That's cool. Yeah, let me also great for sleep. It shows you like really accurate
*  it actually has a sleep coach built in. So it shows you like how much sleep you got, how much
*  recovery, where your recovery is at and what you need. It'll even tell you, you know, hey,
*  you should go to bed since you've been getting up at six o'clock in the morning. You should go to bed
*  by 10 tonight. Nice. Have you noticed an effect? So I've been doing the sauna every day, sorry,
*  five days a week, because I would do it every day, but I got to have, you know, more time with my son.
*  But have you noticed an effect on your sleep at all? Yeah, relaxed. Do you? Yeah. Do you need
*  more sleep though? Like, you know, like when you're working out hard, like you sometimes require like
*  more, more sleep? Yeah. Yeah. Well, when I do squats, for sure. Anytime I do lunges and squats
*  and heavy leg days, I'm a zombie for two days. And like if I have a particularly intellectually
*  challenging podcast, I'll skip leg days. Because I know I'm just gonna be too stupid. I've done it
*  before where I come in and like, I can't form sentences. What's not if you see what I'm doing?
*  There was this weird, there was a study that linked, there was a link between like, leg strength
*  and cognitive function. It's very strong, like the more leg strength you had, like the improve,
*  it was like some kind of crazy number two. It just makes sense that if you have more leg strength,
*  that means you're doing more activity. That means you get more blood flow. That means everything's
*  probably functioning better because it's such an enormous part of your body. When you look at your
*  musculature, the large percentage of it is from the waist down. And when I do, when I'm doing leg
*  work, like if I'm doing most of what I'm doing is kettlebells, but I'm doing lunges and presses and
*  squats and all these different things with heavy kettlebells. So it's like, it's a lot of weight
*  that your muscles are pushing. Dan is always trying to get me to do squats. Like I don't know
*  back when I was in grad school, I was doing squats and I was using the stuff and then I was doing,
*  I guess, what are they called? Leg presses? Yeah. And I like injured myself and in this,
*  I want to call it sciatica. What's the other one that's like sciatica? There's another sciatica
*  is a nerve that comes from your discs being pushed. Like right here? Yes. Well, you know what that's
*  from though. I don't know what I, I don't know what it is and I'm calling it sciatica. Well,
*  sciatica most of the time, what you're getting is your lower back, you're having your discs
*  are protruding and your disc, like if you have herniation of the disc or if you have a bulging
*  disc, it's pushing against your nerve and that's sending that pain down, usually your butt and into
*  your back, your leg and along those lines, right? Is that where you were getting the pain? I don't
*  really get it. It's only, it doesn't go into my leg. It's just like this, like right above my butt.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's a lot of times you think it's that area, but it's not. It's your
*  back and it's your back with a disc pushing into the nerves. Have you had an MRI? No. You should
*  have an MRI. Okay. Cause I'm scared to do squats or like, like every time I do that, I get a flare up
*  and it's like, I'm out. Well, there's other things you can do to strengthen that area. Like what?
*  Like, well, first of all, there's a machine called a reverse hyper. It's fantastic. Reverse hyper.
*  Yeah. I have one out outside. I'll show it to you, but it was created by this guy, Louis Simmons from
*  Westside Barbell. He's a, he's a genius. He's given us a, he gave us this new platform too.
*  That's amazing too. What does that thing call Jamie? Belt squat belt squat. I love this thing
*  because you wear a belt and the, the weight is actually pulling the weight is behind you.
*  I'll show it to how it works before, but you're on this platform and all of the weight is on this
*  belt instead of on your shoulders. So you can have like 250 pounds or whatever it is, but it's all
*  being carried. See that's, that's the thing right there. Yeah. That's similar to what we have,
*  but the machine that we have is a little bit more complicated. But the point is this guy comes out.
*  Are there any pictures of females doing this? Only gorillas. These big giant dudes. But the
*  reverse hyper, the reason why it's so special is, forget about this for a second. Yeah, there's a
*  girl. There's a girl using that. That is a more primitive version of the one that we have out
*  there. The new one that Westside Barbell sent us, it's just a cable that comes through the floor and
*  the weights are actually behind you and it carries, you're carrying all the weight on your hips. So
*  it strengthens the legs without putting a load on the back, which is fantastic. I like that for that.
*  So you can get all the leg work that you get from squats, but you don't get the pressure on the desk.
*  And then the reverse hyper is a machine that he actually invented. Louis Simmons invented it
*  because he had a herniated disc and the doctors are telling them, Hey, we have to operate on you
*  because you have this compressed disc. And so he's a very smart guy and he knows so much about
*  physical fitness and weight training. That's Louis right there. He came up with this machine. So
*  he said, well, listen, if, if something compressed it, something can decompress it. So he came up
*  with this machine and with this machine, the reverse hyper does on the lift, it's strengthening
*  the lower back muscles, but then as you drop it down, it swings low and it actively decompresses
*  all of your discs. Wow. I'd be so scared. That's going to like aggravate it. You know,
*  I'm just no, no, no, no, no, no. Trust me. First of all, you could do it with no weight.
*  The first, you could do it at first with no weight. And that's how a lot of people,
*  when I introduce people to it, I get, have them do no weight. But for me, it's been a,
*  a giant game changer. So I do that. And then there's another thing by Teeter. Teeter makes this
*  decompression decks. It's called the D E X X. And from that you hang from the waist. You like
*  strap your, I have that outside as well. You strap your ankles into it and you hang from the waist
*  and it just all your, that's it right there. So with that, that lady right there in that image,
*  she's holding onto those handles and that's how you kind of get yourself down. But once you get
*  yourself down, you just relax and all of your weight, see how that guy's doing it there. All
*  your weight is decompressing the spine. So it stretches the spine out and decompresses it and
*  it gives you a lot of relief. So between those two particular pieces of equipment, the reverse
*  hyper and this decks too, which, which I fucking love that thing. Um, yeah, D E X two. And that's
*  when I get my home gym, I'm going to have to get all this stuff. Yeah. That's made by Teeter.
*  Teeter has two things that are really cool. It has those, uh, inversion tables, which are great
*  for, you know, the same thing you're hanging by your ankles and it's decompressing your spine. But
*  I actually prefer this product from them because this completely isolates,
*  elates the back and you're not pulling on your knees and your ankles. When you're decompressing,
*  it's all just decompressing the back. And also you can do, um, leg extensions and a bunch of other
*  you see people doing dips and other exercises from the, uh, the Teeter, but it's a great machine.
*  And it's just really specifically good for back health, lower back health, decompressing it,
*  and even strengthening it because you can do those, uh, back extensions. So you hook yourself into
*  it and then you just lift your back up and down. But it shouldn't be, you shouldn't be scared to do
*  it because that's what's going to protect that area. What's going to protect that area is muscle
*  and strength and also flexibility. That would be just incredible. I guarantee you it's going to
*  work because I'm so like the whole time I had a gym membership or it's been like on pause,
*  but the whole reason I had one cause it's on it. Like I'm like scared to do, like I do free weights.
*  I have free weights and I'll do that, but like I'm just scared of machines. All that get you a
*  trainer. That's what I need. That's what you need. Cause so many people fuck themselves up by trying
*  to do things on their own. And I did. And now I'm scared. It's like this, like, and now I'm,
*  I'm guarantee you it's just poor form and all kinds of other stuff. I need to do more. I'm a
*  big, like I go for my, my thing is like, my jam is like endurance. I love going for runs, like,
*  you know, and I, I it's like huge. Like it's so great for the mind, right? That's the reason I
*  do it. Like absolutely with, with this shelter in place thing. Cause I like to do outdoor runs and I
*  don't have a treadmill or anything like that. I mean, it was like, I finally got a jump rope
*  and it came in right when the beaches opened up, but cause I can, I'm good at jumping rope and
*  should have been doing that, but I was saunaing every day and doing, you know, I was doing some,
*  like I do some like ballet stuff, you know, but like I need to do resistance training. Like muscle
*  mass is important for, for aging, for sure. And bone density. It's also density, right. Lifting
*  weights increases bone density, tendon strength, so many different variables that are so huge
*  because as your body gets older, those are the things that go south. Yes. And I, you know, look,
*  I'm going to be 42 next month. So like 52. So that should make you feel better.
*  Yeah. You, I mean, you're definitely like, you're fit, you know, so I need to, I just can't,
*  I can't ever let it go. That's no, and I definitely like my diet. I, you know, that's dialed in and I
*  definitely like do the running and the sauna. Um, but, but I need to be better about resistance
*  training for sure. I used to do yoga a lot, but you know, I became a mom and it's like, I mean,
*  like I used to work out like, you know, twice a day, twice a day I would do, I would do my yoga
*  or my ballet and then I would run. Now it's like, you know, did you realize how much work being a
*  mom was before you did it? Oh no, I had no idea. I mean, it's amazing. So ignorant. Oh, it's, it's
*  no idea. It is. I mean, it's tons of work. I mean, it's insane. Sometimes I like, it's like three
*  o'clock in the afternoon. I'm like, I never brushed my teeth. You know, like I, I haven't
*  showered in a couple of, you know, the sauna thing, like I have to shower now, but like before,
*  before I was doing the sauna every single day. Um, yeah, showers. I mean, it's like nap time. It's
*  like, what can I, I can get work done or I could take a shower. What should I do? I got a lot of
*  work to do. It's hard. It's hard. So thankfully I have help from my mom. My mom is like, you know,
*  she's Nana. So she, she helps out a lot so I can, I can actually get work done. It's hard,
*  you know, being, being a mom that's, you know, I have, you know, I run a business and,
*  but I also like want to be a really good mother. So it's like, yeah, I get it. It's, it's hard.
*  It's very difficult. Um, it does help if you have some equipment in your house, you know, that,
*  that certainly helps. Yes. And that's like, we've been like leaning towards that and it's,
*  you know, we're slowly getting to the, to the point where we're going to have more and more,
*  where it's just like, you have to have easy access. It has to be something you can just,
*  you know, do real quick. You need to find a trainer, just find someone that can, I mean,
*  you can learn a lot online, but you have access to resources. You really need to find someone
*  who's willing to come and you live in a, you live in San Diego. It's an awesome place for fitness.
*  I mean, there's so many people down in San Diego that you could find. Right. Yeah. Find someone,
*  find some gal who's jacked, who knows how to lift weights, you know, and then I'll like inform them
*  all about the sauna and tell them all benefits. Yes. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. I'm sure they can get
*  a lot of that. I mean, but I'm sure there's someone listening to this right now. It's probably going
*  to message you and say, I'll do it. I'm your huckleberry. Hey, I wanted to tell you this about
*  the, the, um, um, I've been nice. It's been like, um, uh, just having, having the effect,
*  I think the first time I came on your podcast, like I don't know how many years it's been. It's
*  been a while, but I talked about the sauna. Yeah. It was like what you were in 2020 now. Yeah.
*  It's more than that. The first time you came on so 2014. Yeah. Cause I was still a postdoc.
*  So yeah, 2015 I stopped, I cut that out. Like I finished my postdoc. So I published a couple
*  studies. So I think it was 2014, but like the sauna, you know, it's just been like something
*  I came on your podcast the first time when we talked about it. And then of course, continued to,
*  to, you know, publish videos and articles and stuff. And I'm writing a, um, a review article
*  for peer review publication right now. But, um, uh, there's a woman who reached out to me. She's a,
*  she was, she had done her, I think her PhD, either her PhD, I don't know,
*  psychology, but she had done it with a guy I interviewed on the podcast, Dr. Charles Rezon,
*  who is, he's the guy who showed that like a single hyperthermic treatment, which was, um,
*  with a device that raised the core body temperature, like almost three degrees could
*  have an antidepressant effect. Well, she reached out to me and like the FDA shut that whole machine
*  down, like, no, you can't use that for research anymore, which kind of shut down the whole sauna
*  depression, you know, research area. So, um, she basically, she has gotten some funding and she's,
*  she's doing a pilot study with a new device, which is something you can like buy off Amazon,
*  where it's like a sauna, like your head's out, but like, it's like a tent, like a sauna tent.
*  Yeah. My wife had one of those before we had a sauna. Yeah. So it's a little, it's different,
*  but it's something that, you know, she's got to prove that it's safe before like the FDA will
*  allow her to even like continue on to like measure, like to study how it affects depression.
*  And so, um, I've been able to, um, you know, help, help with the connections I've had help fund new
*  study she's going to be doing where she's going to get depressed patients, um, to basically be
*  exposed to this sauna. And it's like an intense, like, she's like this intense protocol where like
*  she's like, it's like an hour long and they get really hot and people are giving them wet towels
*  because like, it's like, it's like, imagine being, it's like 140 degrees Fahrenheit. So it's an
*  infrared, but they're in there for like an hour, you know, and they're getting, they raise their
*  core body temperature. They're measuring that rectally. So, um, but she's going to measure the
*  effects on, on, you know, on depressed patients. Uh, so it's really exciting because, and they're
*  going to do like a dose response where they're going to see how many the Charles raison, Dr.
*  Charles raison showed one, just one single session could result in an antidepressant effect six weeks
*  later, she's going to do, try to do eight sessions, like, like where she's going to see if these guys,
*  people can handle over a course of how much time I think it's going to be once a week,
*  once a week for eight weeks. Yes. And when you say, uh, what is the methodology, like what are they
*  using? So, okay. Uh, what are they using? They're using that sauna that I was telling you about the
*  same thing. So they're using that. Yeah. That's the sauna. So she, right now, she, her name is Dr.
*  Ashley Mason. What did they do before where they were saying they caught it? They wouldn't let them
*  use a machine. It was a, it was a device. Um, it was like this device that like basically is sort of
*  like a far infrared thing, but it would, it would raise your core body temperature, um, through,
*  you know, infrared, right? So what is the difference? What difference when people ask me about
*  infrared saunas, infrared, yeah. So infrared saunas, um, the main difference between infrared saunas
*  and like the regular dry saunas that you and I use is that the, the regular dry saunas are heating
*  the ambient air, right? And that's then raising our core body temperature, um, through that
*  mechanism. The infrared saunas are like, they're like changing electrons. They're like, they're like
*  directly heating, they're like directly heating your body basically without having to heat the
*  outside air as much. There have been some studies that have compared, um, I mean, there's benefits
*  with these infrared saunas that in Japan it's called way on therapy. It's far infrared. Um,
*  and they use it, it's been used to like help even treat different cardiovascular diseases. Like it's
*  showed to improve like, um, current like chronic heart failure or something like that, I think.
*  So, um, there's, there's benefits with these, with the, the infrared. Personally, there's,
*  I think there's a lot, there's a lot stronger, there's much more research on, um, not only dry
*  saunas, but in Finland they take, they take the sauna, uh, dry sauna that has like these hot rocks
*  and they pour water on top of the hot rock. And so it creates humidity, right? And so, so that's
*  really a common sauna. Like I went to Finland a few years ago, visited Finland, some other saunas
*  there in Finland. And so that's a very common thing. I think they call it like, first they call,
*  first of all, they call it sauna, sauna, and they call it Lule, Lule or something. Will they make
*  the steam? Do you pour water on your rocks? So our sauna is like, it's pretty small. It's a two
*  person sauna and yes. Um, so I can get the humidity like, if I get it up to 50%, I feel like I'm like,
*  like I'm burning. Yeah. So, um, uh, yeah, if I'm in a rush and I'm like, I'm like, I just got this
*  summer, I got it. You know, I got things to do. I got to, so I'll like pour the, pour the water on
*  the hot rocks to like, just get it really feeling really hot. Uh, but per my personal favorite is
*  like a nice 25 minute, 180, no, no water, just dry. Like I, I like that, but I'm so accustomed to 180
*  that I used one in Vegas. And, uh, when I was there, it's like, it was 160. I was like, this is
*  ridiculous. I could be here forever. And so I just started pouring water on, on the thing. I got 10
*  bottles of water and I just pour in bottles of water. Cause it was just me in there and I got
*  that fucker hot as hell. It was, it was like, okay, now, now we're cooking and I was sweating up a
*  storm. It works. I mean, like I said, ours is really small. And so like, I mean, you're breathing,
*  it's like burning you. There's a direct formula too, between the percentage of humidity and then
*  the increased temperature, the way it feels like if it's at 180, but you have 10% humidity,
*  it's like, yeah, there is, I don't know what that formula is. Absolutely. There's a formula. And in
*  a lot of the studies and coming out of Finland, um, many of the people there are using, are doing
*  the, the, the humid saunas as well. So, I mean, I guess they're called Finnish saunas, which means
*  they're using the hot water and steam. It would be amazing to have a sauna outside,
*  sauna that's right next to a frozen lake, like the way they do it. Oh yeah. They cut a hole in
*  the lake and then get the party started. So what we did, I went, I visited the sauna society and,
*  um, it was in November, so it was cold and, um, it's right on a lake. And so they have like,
*  the day I went, it was not coed day. So, um, the, you know, it's only women saunas that I went in.
*  There was like, it was like sectioned off, but so you go and you do these different, they have all
*  these different types and I don't remember. And they're like whipping each other with like birchwood,
*  you know, which, um, it's interesting. Yeah. The Russians like to do that too. They call it the
*  banya. Right. The Russian banya. They beat each other with this, these branches that are wet.
*  So, okay, let me tell you my story. Anyways, they jump in the lake and then they go back and
*  they're doing this. Right. So here's my, did I ever tell you my crazy story,
*  fun story about Finland? Which crazy story? So I have a friend, he's a friend. He's, you know,
*  some of your friends are a little eccentric, right? Well, this guy, he's got, he's got, um,
*  you know, huge, um, property in, in like the country, in the woods, like in, in Finland.
*  And this was like the first time I ever went camping and it was like snow camping. It was crazy. It
*  was like the worst thing ever. Like he had, he had us do this, like, there was like two tents and,
*  and it was a conference that I gave a talk at. And so there, some people paid extra to like go
*  to this event that, that was after it. So there was like 30 or so people there and they were from
*  all around the world. There was only like three Americans, me, Dan, and some other guy, no,
*  four Americans, I think. But anyways, um, it was my first time camping like outside, like not in
*  like, like I've been to Yosemite, but I like stay in a cabin, you know, I don't like sleep in a tent.
*  Right. But so it wasn't a great experience because one, there was this guy who snored
*  all night too, because it was snow camping. We had to like, there was some weird fire thing and he
*  was, this guy was in the military. And so he had us do this thing where like everyone had to wake up
*  at, I forgot what it was every hour. Someone's you had to pass this. So you're in a big wall tent.
*  We were in a big, I don't know what it was called, but I didn't sleep the whole night and it was
*  awful. But here's my sauna experience. So he, um, doesn't believe in, you can't wear like swimsuits
*  or anything in the sauna. So you have to be like, you have to wear no clothes or if you,
*  if you really wanted, you could wear a towel, like if you were modest or whatever, because to
*  them it's like, no big deal. The sauna, you just, you don't wear any clothes. I never buy that.
*  I think they're just freaks. Okay. So they were telling, I know they told me, they told me,
*  oh no, the sauna is an asexual place. And I'm like, really, really you're a human being.
*  I know. So, so, so only three people wore a towel, me, Dan, and this other American.
*  And so everyone was in there naked, lots of like, there weren't that many females. Um, but there
*  were some from, I don't know, the UK or in some German, I don't know, but they were all naked.
*  Like it was like, I guess Europeans are like that, you know, like they're more used to it or that's
*  what someone would tell me. I don't know what the, what the case is, but anyways, I had people coming
*  up to me going, I love your podcast. And this I'm like, I'm not going to get naked before like
*  at the conference and they were there and you like, you think I'm going to be naked, like in
*  the sauna with someone who's like, I mean, a podcast fan. Oh my God. They're in your face.
*  So anyways, I'm in the sauna and everyone's naked. And then he, the, and the guy who's my friend,
*  okay, he's still my friend, but he's, he's an interesting guy, but he had like people come and
*  started doing yoga. So like, and they're naked too. Jesus naked. They're doing down.
*  They're doing, yeah.
*  Wonderful. Yeah. So that was like my, my first finished sauna experience where it was like,
*  people are too open-minded. They really are when it comes to things like that. I was just happy.
*  He was like, you can wear a towel if you want, because he has this whole, I wouldn't do it.
*  I'm like, get out of here. You're not staring at my junk. Yeah. So then I went, they were all
*  jumping in the lake after, and I'm like, I'm going to just sit on this pad. It was freezing out here
*  in Finland in November. I'm not going to take my towel off and jump in the lake for like,
*  why can't you wear a swimsuit? Why says who? Like, what is the difference? There's zero
*  difference in the benefits of it. He is some cultural thing. It's a cultural thing. And also
*  he claimed that there's like toxins being released from one of those assholes. Fuck off, buddy. I
*  got a swimsuit on. And then, okay, the yoga was bad. It got worse. Then he had some, he had some
*  whipping technique with the birchwood and he wanted to demonstrate it. So we had one of the
*  Britain girls, and she was just laying, I mean, it was just like, it was too much. Here's the truth.
*  I was hot as fuck. So I didn't care anymore. I cared about my towel, but I didn't care what
*  was going on. I was trying not to look at everyone. I didn't want to see, I'm married. I don't want to
*  see everyone's stuff. Well, people get sexual too, because it's hot and sweaty. And if this guy is,
*  it sounds like he's a little bit of a cult leader. Right? Like someone needs to be naked. Oh, okay.
*  That's how it starts. Someone was asking me that because he passed out like this flyer,
*  because it's like we were doing all these events, you know, all these events were happening and this
*  flyer passed out and was like, we're reading it. And I was like, says you have to, you can't wear
*  any clothes or swimsuit or anything. Cause I had packed my swimsuit. I was like, yeah, I'm gonna
*  wear my swimsuit in the sauna. You can't tell people they can't wear clothes. This is his own
*  home sauna. You know? Yeah. How convenient. But you could wear a towel. So. Great. Thanks buddy.
*  All that toxins talk too. As soon as someone's talking about cleansing toxins, we're like,
*  fuck off. I was like so put off with the toxins stuff. Like it's funny cause the sauna,
*  like that's like the one, like for years, like all the benefits about sauna were always about
*  toxins, right? Right? They're always toxins, toxins. What are you talking about? Like show me what
*  you're saying when you're talking about, you talking about just regular sweat. But it does.
*  You do actually, you do regular sweat. It doesn't have to be from sauna. It could be from exercise,
*  but you do, you do sweat out certain compounds like aluminum, aluminum. It's like, it's funny
*  that you, you can actually excrete certain compounds better from sweat than urine. Cause
*  that's another way of eliminating things is through urine. But aluminum, cadmium, and there's one other
*  that I don't remember sweat. It's like the best way to get, to get rid of that. The conversations
*  you have with people that are into releasing toxins. It's like, you're talking mumbo jumbo
*  talk most of the time. I try not, I'm trying not to judge. Like I really should judge, but I have a
*  hard time when they start to go there. I'm like, you should have a hard time and you should judge.
*  I do, but I try not to. Well, it's just, they say things that they don't really know what the fuck
*  they're talking about. And they say it was such authority. And I've had those conversations in
*  public saunas before too, where people are, people like they start getting into the toxins
*  and the whole sauna. And like, I'm just sitting there quiet and I'm just like, okay, let me start
*  to tell you some benefits, like some real benefits, cardiovascular. Did you know that it actually
*  mimics exercise? Like literally like that's been shown. It's been like compared like 25 minutes in
*  the sauna, 25 minutes on a stationary bike and same things are happening. You know, like blood
*  pressure goes down afterwards, heart rate variability improves, you know, so same things are happening.
*  You're increasing plasma volume, heart rate increases, core temperature increases, right?
*  Exercise is doing the same thing. That's the antidepressant effect, like that I feel from the
*  sauna and that Charles Raison published, you know, and that Dr. Mason will hopefully carry on the
*  torch. I think it's real. And I think that there's potentially multiple mechanisms, immune, you know,
*  modulations, but also just the fact that like BDNF, you know, there's a study showing that hot baths
*  do increase BDNF and BDNF brain drive neurotrophic factor, which why would you think everybody would
*  know what that means? I know I just thought everyone that listened to your podcast, not everyone
*  is millions of people. I don't even know what it means. You do when you say it. What's he said?
*  I go, okay. Yeah, brain drive, BDNF brain derived, new tropic factor. Yeah. What's so amazing about
*  this neurotrophic factor is that it's always thought about in the context of like brain aging,
*  because it helps you grow new neurons. It's neurogenesis. It helps us already existing
*  neurons survive. But there's studies now showing that it regulates what's called neuroplasticity,
*  which is like the ability, like your brain, your brain changes, you know, with the changing
*  environment, but you have to be able to adapt to that, right? Like children are really good at that.
*  Like they have a lot of neuroplasticity. But neuroplasticity is associated with depression,
*  like not like not being able like stressful conditions and stuff like that, like not being
*  able to like adapt. I'm not using like the best of terms, but neuroplasticity is something along
*  those lines. And so and BDNF plays a role in that. And BDNF has been shown to be, you know,
*  to increase with exercise and also with heat stress. I'm glad you brought up hot baths,
*  because that's something that I wanted to cover before we got off track. When we're talking about
*  sauna, when people that don't have access to a sauna, how much benefit can they get out of a
*  hot bath? Oh, I'm glad you brought that up because there was, you know, so a couple of things. One,
*  there was a study that showed hot baths can have an antidepressant effect. And these people were
*  put in 104 degrees Fahrenheit bath, where they were up to their shoulders for like 20 to 30 minutes.
*  And the sham control was like a green light. Like, so people thought they were getting a
*  treatment, they were getting some kind of green light therapy or whatever, you know, so it was a
*  placebo control, because placebo effects definitely real, particularly with depression. And it had a
*  pretty powerful antidepressant effect, very similar to Charles Raison's study with the
*  hyperthermic chamber thing. And when you say antidepressant, there's no real way to measure
*  that? They have this whole, yeah, I mean, so there are some, there's potential biomarkers being
*  identified. C-Ract to protein being one, inflammation, there's like a huge link now
*  between the immune system and chronic inflammation and depression, brain function in general, brain
*  aging, but inflammation. So I mean, that's, there's a push for looking, but not all depressed
*  patients have it. It's like there's a subset of C-Ract to protein. But yeah, depression's measured.
*  It's a very much like, you know, have someone, so a subjective measurement would be a clinical
*  person like measuring a whole battery of things they do. I forgot the name of the test, but yeah,
*  that's the test. So it's like basically a battery of feeling things. So it's not like a hardcore
*  quantitative biomarker, which is so badly is needed. But the hot baths have also been shown.
*  So heat shock proteins, which do like amazing, there's so many amazing things that heat shock
*  proteins do. They've been shown to prevent muscle atrophy. And that's, you know, in the brain,
*  they're so important, like preventing proteins from aggregating in the brain. That's how I first
*  got in, like one of my first biological experiments ever, because I was a chemistry major in college.
*  So I was doing all chemistry stuff, organic chemistry and like chemistry. But after I graduated,
*  I went to work at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla. I was working in an aging
*  lab. And one of the first experiments I had that I was doing, like one of my first projects,
*  was we were taking the human amyloid beta gene and injecting them in these worms, these nematode
*  worms that only live like 14 or 15 days. And we're making them form amyloid plaques in their
*  muscle. So like basically, you look at these little worms under a microscope, so only like
*  half a millimeter, half a millimeter, you know, they move around. And as like they get older,
*  and they're aging, they don't move as quickly, you know, they're kind of slower, a little more
*  decrepit. But anyways, you give them this amyloid beta. And after like a couple of days, they become
*  paralyzed, where they're like laying in their little petri dish plate on the E. coli food you're
*  giving them. And they kind of just move around just to feed like their nose just moving around.
*  And so when we would give them tons of heat shock proteins, in addition to the amyloid, totally
*  reversed it, like completely. Like they would move around and be young. So anyways, heat shock
*  proteins play a role in like neurodegenerative disease, also some links to like improving
*  depression in animal studies. But can you measure heat shock proteins in the bath versus
*  sauna? Yeah, so that's been done. So the sauna, I know of one study where people that sat in a
*  163 degree Fahrenheit sauna for 30 minutes had heat shock proteins, their levels were 50% higher
*  over baseline. And which is great. And that usually like animal studies show that they can
*  stay elevated for like 48 hours after that. There's a hot bath study where they also elevated,
*  wasn't quite as high, but it was like, you know, 40 or so percent higher than baseline levels. And
*  it was 104 degrees. But this study, instead of doing it from the shoulders down, where I told
*  you about the depression, it was like only 20, 30 minutes, it was like from the waist down. So they
*  had to stay in there for an hour. It's like a jacuzzi, you know, where you're sitting there from
*  the waist down and like, that's hot, like saying in 104, that's, that's pretty hot. But heat shock
*  proteins did increase. So I think, you know, for people that don't have access to a sauna,
*  um, that hot baths absolutely are a good, a modality for heat stress. And I used it for a long
*  time. Like I said, I just got a sauna. Like I've, I've been, I've made a career about talking about
*  saunas, you know, and I just got one like last month. So like, like I understand what it's like
*  to not have a sauna and to have to use hot baths. But I was also using the gym saunas, but right now
*  it's like, there's no gyms that are open. So yeah, there's a hot baths are like the only,
*  the only really choice if you don't have a hot sauna, a home sauna. What about cold shock proteins?
*  And the, I mean, how much difference is it between taking a really cold shower, ice bath versus
*  something like cryo cryotherapy? Like the place that I took you to. Yeah. So I mean, there's,
*  there's differences in, in, I mean, so it depends on how long you're staying in a cold, you know,
*  water, like cold shower, like actually being submerged, like from like, if you're like in the
*  ocean or something or a lake and you're like from your shoulders down, like that's probably much
*  more powerful than just having to shower on. But by the way, the shower, like some days I'm like,
*  what is the matter? This, this is not cold at all. You know, it's just so variable where it's just
*  like Southern Southern California. You live on the right, the border of Mexico yesterday. So, so,
*  most of the time now I shower right after the sun. That's like my shower time now. And so like it's,
*  I do about six minutes and it's so easy for me. I've totally have adapted and I'm not sure if I've
*  just totally adapted or if it's just like my faucets doesn't get as, like just doesn't get
*  cold that cold. Like it really doesn't. Today I took a cold shower from home and my sauna is not
*  there. And I did it just because I wanted to have the mood effects, the norepinephrine that's been
*  shown to be increased. And it was much colder, but then again, it was a different shower.
*  I'm not sure if it's cause I didn't have the hot before, you know, beforehand, like the hot being
*  hot and like getting in the cold shower, like it just feels really good. But the cold shock,
*  you asked me cold shock proteins, that, that hasn't really been measured in humans. What is
*  measured most of the time with cold shock is norepinephrine release and norepinephrine
*  in plasma. And there has been studies correlating norepinephrine in plasma upon cold exposure,
*  norepinephrine release in plasma to in the brain where it's involved with like mood and focus and
*  attention. So there's been studies where like you could do a two minute cryo, whatever the average
*  temperature, it's really cold. Minus two forties. Something like that. Yeah. And then that could be
*  compared to like, you know, a longer, a longer duration in 50 degree, you know, I think 50 degree
*  Fahrenheit water or something like that. I don't remember the exact time, but, but it is comparable,
*  but you have to stay in a longer duration. So some people prefer ice baths. Some athletes
*  prefer the ice bath versus cryotherapy, even though it's probably more painful because it
*  lasts a lot longer. Have you done those ice baths? Oh, I've done it. I've only done the cryo. So I've,
*  have you ever done like cold shower after your sauna? Yes. Do you like it? I like it a lot. I
*  like it particularly after hot yoga, after hot yoga, after hot yoga, especially in the winter,
*  when it's actually cold, the water's cold. That's when I love it. There's something
*  mood enhancing. I mean, these things also affect the immune system, by the way, which is also very
*  relevant, both cold and hot. They both have been shown to increase lymphocyte numbers and also like
*  other myeloid cells and stuff in people. But, but like, there's something like I've done the sauna
*  and then gone into an ice bath and then, you know, it's just really, it's hard. It's cold. I mean,
*  you feel good, but man, you know, I think just like the guy's house, I was doing it, I was trying to
*  impress them. So, you know, I'm hardcore, I could do this, but it was, it was pretty intense. I do,
*  I do eventually want to get some kind of like, they have those like, like ice, those baths that
*  you can like regulate, like regulate the water temperature. You know, ones that you plug in,
*  yeah, they're not ice baths at all. They just cool the water. That's just too much work, like ice and baths.
*  Yeah, we wanted to get one here. We're probably going to wind up doing that. Get one here.
*  You should, because you have two showers and the shower next to the sauna is kind of useless.
*  So who uses the sauna here, Jamie? Just me. You don't use the sauna? He uses it occasionally.
*  Occasionally, yeah. I also had a gym I was going to for... You do use the sauna though, right?
*  Yeah. Yeah, I use it every day. I usually use it at home, but sometimes I use it here when I,
*  like right after workouts. Like if I work out, I try to get a workout here before, you know, like
*  before I do podcasts and I'll time it so they have an extra hour so I can get in the sauna.
*  That's awesome. Yeah, it makes a big difference for me. But I also just, I think it might be a
*  little too much before, like I'm always trying to regulate how much activity I do with whether or
*  not I'm going to be exhausted when I do a podcast. Because I used to do yoga and then I would come
*  out, I would get out of yoga at 11 or at 1030 and I would do a podcast at 12 and I was like,
*  woof, I think I have a better way to one. Because I'd just be so... Because 90 minute yoga classes
*  in 105 degrees is fucking rough. It's intense. It's rough, yeah. I've only done Bikram a couple
*  times. I would love to like do it more. I loved it. Yeah. I really loved it. Well, I would wonder,
*  and I know there's supposedly some sort of Harvard study that's ongoing right now measuring all sorts
*  of markers in people that have done hot yoga and whether or not it mimics heat shock proteins that
*  are created in the sauna. Because the thing is like you are getting this incredible cardiovascular
*  exercise because your heart's beating like crazy. And you're not doing cardio per se, but your heart
*  rate gets jacked because of the heat and the stress. And then on top of that, even though it's
*  only 105 degrees, your body is heating up. You're really sweating up a storm in there. I've taken
*  some friends there that have never experienced it before and they're like, fucking yoga. Come on,
*  bro. Yoga. And then they get in there and then I look over at them 15 minutes in and they're like,
*  fucking A. And I'm like, yeah. It is. I told you. It's not what you think it is. Because yoga,
*  even uncoupled from the heat strip, like the hot part, yoga is also like, it's pretty intense,
*  holding those positions and stuff. And your heart rate does start to elevate. It's like
*  just from that alone. Adding on the sauna, which mimics moderate physical activity that's been
*  shown, absolutely mimics it. And then all the studies that have shown that on top of that,
*  I mean, it's super intense. It's super intense. The really cool thing about, and I want to get my mom,
*  I think once we move the sauna to our home where it's not like the office, I want to people that
*  are not people that are sedentary and people that are sedentary for whatever reason, maybe
*  they're sedentary because they're disabled or maybe they're sedentary because they've had a
*  lifetime of being sedentary. And it's, it is just hard to get them motivated to go exercise. Like
*  the sauna to me is like, that's so important because it's giving these people a potential
*  cardiovascular workout. No, it is. That's been shown. It's giving them a cardiovascular workout
*  without having to force them to go for a run or get on a bike. You know, the people think like
*  when you tell them go sit in the sauna, they think of like a spa, like, yeah, I want to go do that.
*  You get someone who's like, like my mom, who she's, she's sedentary, you know, she's, she's not like
*  a physically active person and she needs to be. But like the sauna, that's, that's kind of my goal
*  is to get her doing, and we'll have to start slowly because you have to adapt. You know, the
*  heat shock proteins help with that as you, the more, the more times you're exposed to heat stress
*  and the more adapted you are, like the heat shock proteins increase quicker. And so it's
*  part of the adaptation process as well of, you know, being able to handle the heat stress. But
*  like, I want to get her to do that because like any, you know, any cardiovascular improvement is
*  going to help her mood. It's going to help her, her, you know, all cause mortality that's been shown,
*  you know, 47 times a week, 40, 40% lower all cause mortality. Cardiovascular related mortality is
*  50% lower, you know? So like, I think that's a really cool thing about the sauna is that you
*  can get people that are disabled, people that can't go for a run, you know? I mean, I still think
*  exercise, I mean, it's just the best thing ever. Yeah. Period. For everything, you know, for
*  everything. It's just going to overall improve the way you age and that's going to make you more
*  robust and resilient to anything. Yeah. Sauna to me is, there's so many benefits, but one of the
*  big ones is that muscles feel better. They feel looser. They're not as sore. Like when I have hard
*  workouts and I get in the sauna afterwards, I feel like my recovery is more rapid. Interesting. That's
*  interesting. Yeah. I, because I don't do a lot of resistance training, shame on me. I don't have
*  that same perspective, but there have been studies, at least we're localized heat on people that had
*  a limb immobilized. I don't remember what limb it was, but after a week, people that had the heat
*  treatment, local heat treatment had almost 40% less muscle atrophy. That's huge. It's huge. In
*  animal studies and like, I remember I like shared this animal study in an article I wrote years ago
*  before the human study came out and like there were critics, well, it's animals and blah, blah,
*  blah. You can't say it does this. And I would get on the mechanism and they showed it was heat
*  shock proteins and there was all, you know, like, and I was so happy when that human study came out.
*  Cause it was like, told you, told you motherfucker. Like that's what I wanted to say. You know,
*  there's just a few of those, those guys that you're just like, you're like, maybe I just,
*  I don't know, like do a big comprehensive search to the literature and understand things and,
*  you know, don't have that exact study just yet, but like, I know that it's going to help with
*  muscle atrophy. So people love to dismiss things, don't they? Yes. They really do. Even if,
*  even if they're wrong, they just love to like fixate on confirmation bias, a little possible
*  potential things that might dismiss it instead of just being open-minded and going, Hmm.
*  I think that happens a lot too with like social media, because like, for example, if I share one
*  study, I'll share like an, an epidemiological study and it's like, it's Twitter, you know,
*  I'm doing 140 care or whatever the chain, I don't know what the characters are now, but I'm doing
*  a small number of characters and I'm just sharing one study. And if it happens to be
*  a non-randomized controlled trial, then, you know, it's just correlation doesn't,
*  you know, doesn't equal causation. It's like, sometimes I just share a story because one,
*  I think it's interesting or two, because I've read a bunch of, you know, evidence surrounding
*  this topic, you know, about all the other clinical evidence, all the genetic evidence, all the animal
*  like, and, and so I have a knowledge base here. And so I share a study that may be isolated in
*  and of itself is not the strongest study, but you know, it's like, you can't read the comments.
*  That's the problem. You can't. Like you just can't. I can't. Someone else does it. It's like trying
*  to strike up a conversation in the porta potty. It affects me. Like I'm the kind of person where
*  like, I like to make people happy. Like it, it bothers me when people are like unhappy. It
*  bothers me when people like, well then don't go on Twitter period. Cause most of those people are
*  unhappy or YouTube. No, I mean, it, I, I, I guess that's not really the case. I, for me at least,
*  the bigger audience that for you, for sure. I mean, the bigger your audience is, the more
*  you get that. This is what I try to explain to a friend of mine who was on the podcast, who
*  who read the comments and I go, do you just have to stop and think, okay, even if just
*  1% of all of my people that go from Instagram, like if you're reading the Instagram comments,
*  1% are assholes, just one, which is probably really conservative, right? If you get a room
*  full of people, there's a hundred people in the room. What are the odds that one of them is going
*  to be an asshole? It's a hundred percent, right? That means there's 92,000 assholes. That's a lot.
*  That's untenable. You can't manage that. Right. 92,000 shitheads who have half assed their whole
*  life and they want to just, they want to shoot people down, make people feel bad and just don't.
*  Yeah. It's not worth it. I don't. And I feel for those people, I genuinely do. I feel for people
*  that are in that state where they realize that they're not happy. They're not happy with their
*  own performance and not happy with their life. They're probably not happy with their relationship
*  or their job and they just want to spew nonsense and negative garbage. Yeah. I mean, that's the
*  problem with not being able to, it's delicious. That is really delicious. Yeah. Kilcliffe,
*  25 milligrams CBD. All right. Mango. I got some other flavors too. The problem with that is you'll
*  fixate on the one person that says the negative. Exactly. It's a natural human inclination.
*  And that fixation for me keeps me up at night. Like when I lay down. Don't say that. But like,
*  it doesn't happen much anymore because like I try like not to read. I've gotten so much better
*  at it. But you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. No. In the early days of social media,
*  before I got a handle on it, I'd be like, fuck, this is stress. It's like so taxing. Like you'd
*  get into discussions with people. Like, what am I doing? I think it's important to be critical.
*  And I get like, you know, there's, there are people that are really trying to like make,
*  you know, prove something and there's, there's all sorts of incentives for being hyper critical.
*  Well, if you had rational people who are kind folks who have interesting viewpoints
*  and they looked at something and they found something to be wrong with that. And they handled
*  it with, you know, grace and some sort of modicum of dignity and kindness. That'd be great. Yeah.
*  I mean, if you are those people to sure, like if you were having a discussion with a good friend
*  and the good friend was looking at something that you said and said, I disagree because of this.
*  Look, I have conversations with good friends all the time. And even on the podcast where I disagree
*  with them, but we handle it like friends, but that's the problem with Twitter is that you don't
*  see that person. You don't, you know, you don't know them. You don't want to please them. You just
*  want to be mean, you know, and that's what a lot of people are doing. And they're just getting their
*  rocks off there. Cause they're, and I feel like now for a while during the pandemic, when it started
*  and the lockdown started, people were nicer. There was less social justice outraged. There was less
*  this, but now it seems like as time's gone on and people getting more frustrated and more desperate
*  and more depressed because they're locked up, it seems like it's ramped up. It's hot. I mean,
*  this is unprecedented, right? I mean, it is, I, I miss, I miss my life before the pandemic. I miss
*  taking my son to the park. I miss our soccer classes. And I mean, like music classes, I miss
*  it. It is hard. My kids are having drive by birthday parties where they drive by with
*  balloons and yell out the window, happy birthday. Like, they're never going to forget this. They're
*  never going to forget how weird this is. They're doing all their classrooms on iPads. I'm like,
*  this is so weird. See, my son's at an age where he's, this is, he's not going to really remember.
*  Well, I mean, depending, I, you know, I really think that I think things will start to,
*  will start to get better. Well, if it doesn't, I'm going to move to a place where it's better
*  because I think the way this, this state is handling it is terrible. They're treating us
*  like we're infants. Some of the lists they've given you of a proven activities and non-approven
*  activities. That's highlights it for me because the lists are, I don't know if you've seen the
*  list. I haven't, I didn't even know that. Oh, pull it up, Jamie. They're so stupid because you got
*  to realize these people that are writing these lists, these are not experts. These are bureaucrats.
*  These are politicians. These are people that really have no business telling you what to do and what
*  not to do. They're fools, but they're in a position to influence millions and millions of people. So
*  they have the ability to tell 40 million people what they can and can't do. Make that a little
*  larger so I can read this. Look at this. Athletics, badminton, singles, throwing a baseball, softball,
*  BMX, writing, canoeing, singles, crabbing, you know, crabbing, you'll find crabs, cycling,
*  exploring rock pools. Oh, can I, can I explore rock pools? You fucks gardening, not in groups,
*  golf, singles, walking, no cart. Why? Why can't I take my cart? Who are you? Hiking trails, paths,
*  allowing distancing, horse riding, singles, jogging and running. It gets, gets grosser. Meditation. Oh,
*  you can do outdoor photography. I didn't know. I thought that was going to kill everybody.
*  Wait, what is, what's the top of this? What's this headline? What is this page? Approved outdoor
*  activities. It gets worse. For LA or for California? For California, it gets worse.
*  Scroll down. It gets so stupid towards the end. Oh look, soft martial arts, Tai Chi Kung,
*  not in groups. Chi Kung. They've listed the martial arts. Like fuck off. Table tennis, singles,
*  trail running, trampolining. Oh, can I get on a trampoline? Thanks. Didn't know. How about this
*  one? Watch the sunrise or sunset. How about wash the car? Oh, you can wash the car? Oh, great.
*  I thought rocks were falling from the fucking sky and I couldn't wash the car. Jesus Christ. But
*  that's what drives me bonkers. In all cases, you should only do these activities alone or with
*  members of your household. Make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and those outside
*  your household. You fucking clowns. So have you been like doing comedy bits? Like have you been
*  writing? No. No? No, I haven't written anything. No. Yeah, I thought I should. But I've decided to
*  accept where this is and then when comedy clubs are about to open up, then I'll start writing
*  again. But I'm just accepting where this is and I want to have an honest take on it. I don't want
*  to be manufacturing a take or trying to come up with some sort of a hot take on how I feel.
*  But I want to know how I really feel about this and how I really feel about this is very different
*  now versus the way it was in March because in March I was concerned and I was like, Jesus Christ,
*  this could be terrible. We really have to stockpile food. We really have to make sure that we have
*  water purification. We really have to be careful here. Now I'm like, we've got to be careful,
*  these fucking politicians. Now I'm in the place where you guys have to understand these people,
*  people are starving. People don't have any money. You're telling people they can't go to work,
*  but you're telling people they can go to work in some places. Like why is it okay to work at Target,
*  but it's not okay to work in a family business? Why is it okay? Let's figure out testing. Let's
*  quarantine the people who are sick. This strategy that you guys have, you're not adjusting and
*  adapting. You're not adjusting and adapting to the numbers, the mortality numbers too,
*  because they're way lower than they were before. Plus now we have this understanding of the
*  asymptomatic people and how many people have tested positive that are asymptomatic. It's off
*  the charts. It's somewhere in the range in many studies of 70 plus percent of people that get in
*  contact with this are asymptomatic, but test positive for the disease. That's crazy.
*  Asymptomatic? So that's the thing we got to be careful about. Maybe 40 to 50 could be like,
*  there's probably a range. I have friends that are asymptomatic, went through the entire disease.
*  It's out of their system. They never felt it. Yeah. I have one friend who he did, he had tightness
*  in his chest, but he actually was in outside of Wuhan in December. So he was like, he got it.
*  At the time he just thought it was some little whatever. Chest cold. Yeah, but it was mostly
*  just tightness, he said. It wasn't like, you know. That's what's crazy about this. There's so many
*  variables in terms of how people are affected by it and what goes wrong. Because there are so
*  many variables. There's your genetics, there's your immune system. How is your immune system
*  shaped? There's your diet that's included in it, your vitamin D status. The other interesting
*  thing, and there's been no studies with SARS-CoV-2, but there have been influenza studies showing that
*  viral dose. It's really interesting studies that have been done where, I don't know who volunteers
*  for these studies, but sign me up to get influenza. I want to be... Right. Let's give me a full load
*  of virus. They somehow get healthy people to do that. There's been these studies where people are
*  like intranasal, they'll give them various titers of influenza virus. The point of the studies to
*  figure out what viral dose, and they have some measurement in tissue culture number or whatever.
*  They found to make people have symptoms. They found with influenza, I forgot which A or something,
*  I think one of the strains, it was like they could do a certain dose like 10 to the 7 in
*  tissue culture or whatever units, where 70% of the people would get symptoms ranging from fever,
*  cough, and all the influenza flu symptoms. But then when they went down from 10 to the 7,
*  let's say they went down to 10 to the 5, only 10% of people were getting symptoms. It's interesting
*  that viral dose, at least with influenza, and there's actually been some other studies, I think
*  measles also. It is a thing, not something that you want to go and experiment with yourself,
*  but that's another possibility. For sure, when you hear about nurses. Yes, they're getting
*  way more sick. That could be one reason. Right. Their actual job is to be around infected people,
*  and they're intubating these people, and they're doing chest compressions. They're getting their
*  respiratory droplets. Oh, yeah, they're getting it right in their faces. Some of them, they have
*  poor PPE, especially in the beginning when you're seeing these people that were using
*  makeshift masks and trying to, it's horrible. Yeah, I think with the masks, for people,
*  reopening the economy, and some places have been more successful, even Japan and stuff, where
*  the wearing the mask, the cloth mask doesn't do much to prevent you from breathing in maybe
*  a respiratory droplet or something or aerosol, but it will prevent you from spreading it.
*  To a certain degree, I get that people don't want to wear masks. It sucks. Who wants to wear a mask?
*  But maybe to open up the economy again, now, maybe everyone could wear a mask if they're going to be
*  inside around a bunch of people, grocery stores, theaters. It's certainly better than keeping the
*  economy closed. It's better than keeping the economy closed. I'll be willing to do it. It's not going
*  to be forever. You know why it's not going to be forever? Because we're going to figure this stuff
*  out. We are. We're already finding repurposed therapeutics, the monoclonal antibodies, people
*  working on that. That's going to be coming soon. What is that? The monoclonal antibodies. Remember,
*  you were talking about the llama. So the whole point of that is that they're identifying antibodies
*  that can neutralize the virus, and they're going to grow them and manufacture them and give them to
*  people. It'll help treat. Eventually, they'll identify one that works. What kind of a timeline
*  do you think they have for something like this? I think that these therapeutics can start...
*  Remdesivir has already been identified, and they may start to identify other ones like the
*  pancreatitis drug in Japan, Camistat, something. There's the Pepsid. There's a lot of different
*  repurposing drugs that are being investigated. I think over the next couple of months, and then
*  Regeneron's already doing one of these monoclonal antibodies, I think in the next couple of months,
*  we'll have more therapeutics than we have right now. That'll make things less scary. People will
*  be less scared of getting sick because they'll have a better idea of, oh, we have some more
*  things that can therapeutically treat this successively. Hopefully, people are going to
*  start looking at the vitamin D. I really hope that. If not, I hope people are going to take
*  their vitamin D or ask their doctor to take it. I think then a couple of months... Can you wear a
*  mask for a couple of months? Here's why it's not going to work to just have the people that are
*  vulnerable wear the mask, because the cloth mask isn't going to prevent them from getting the
*  aerosolized droplets if you're spreading it and asymptomatic, which it's been shown that if you are
*  asymptomatic... That CDC study I mentioned a while ago about how pre-symptomatic versus asymptomatic,
*  after a week when they came back to measure the people again, they found that out of the 13,
*  10 of them actually did get symptoms. The other three that were asymptomatic had as much... They
*  were spreading... Sorry, shedding as much virus that could make them basically contagious and
*  basically able to transmit it to others. That's so strange.
*  The point is that I think that I know people don't want to wear masks. I have family members that
*  think it's infringing their freedom. It does suck. I know people are... The thing is also children.
*  I don't know how to tackle that issue because it's really hard. That seems a little more
*  difficult. But adults, I think that if you're working, you want to open your restaurant back
*  up, your masks... I think that seems like a good compromise, right? Doesn't it?
*  Yeah, it does. The children... It's real weird with this disease because some children are
*  getting sick, but it's a very small number. But many children are getting in contact with
*  this disease. How many of them are asymptomatic but are spreading it?
*  There've been quite a few studies looking at children that are asymptomatic, children that
*  have mild symptoms, and children that are symptomatic. So far, the studies have shown,
*  for the most part, that children even that are asymptomatic are shedding as much virus as both
*  children that are symptomatic and adults that are symptomatic, meaning they're able to transmit
*  it. They're shedding the virus. The sprinkler systems. They are. They're like notoriously...
*  I used to never get sick. And then I became a mom. I think, first of all, the first year,
*  it hit me hard because I wasn't sleeping because you have to like every three hours, you got to
*  feed the baby. That's a giant factor in immune system. Oh, sleep is huge. We didn't talk about
*  that. I know you've had Mt. Walker on the podcast. I've had him. He's talked about it before and
*  lots of other researchers have studied this. Sleep is so important for immune function. So
*  important. But we're all not... No one's working because they're probably getting more sleep now.
*  But they're also stressed out and they have anxiety. In particular, their bills are piling
*  up and they have no income. That's true. It's awful. It's really awful. It's awful. And it's awful
*  for so many of these people that didn't do anything wrong. They didn't do anything wrong.
*  They built a business and now that business is crushed. Man, I think you got to give the option.
*  You got to give people the option to go to work. You have to. You can't do this, especially...
*  Give them an option, but wear a mask. Yeah. This is not the plague that we thought it was going to
*  be. This is not the horrible tragedy that we thought it was going to be. It's not. It's not.
*  It's definitely not. I'll agree with you on that. I think a month and a half ago, I thought I was
*  going to see body bags in the street. I was like, this is going to be really bad. I was terrified.
*  And it thankfully has not been that bad. New York City got hit pretty hard. But we have been on
*  lockdown, so that has to be accounted for. I would like to see... In New York City,
*  particularly when they were getting hit, you got to think this is New York City in January,
*  which is January. It's winter time. People are not going outdoors. I wonder how much
*  vitamin D deficiency varies, dependent upon winter. There's been tons of studies, tons of studies,
*  tons of studies showing that vitamin D levels are much lower in the winter time. It also correlates.
*  There's been studies correlating it with seasonal defective disorder and all that. But yes,
*  January, vitamin D deficiency is lower, for sure. But I would like to see a study on whether or not
*  it varies between the East Coast and the West Coast, because over here, we do have all these
*  sunny days. And people are outside far more often than they are in New York.
*  Particularly in Southern California.
*  Yeah. And they wear less clothes. They're wearing t-shirts. They're wearing shorts.
*  You have more skin exposed.
*  Someone might have done that study.
*  I would like to see that study, because it makes sense. Look, and people are shittier over there.
*  Maybe that's why they're shittier. They're cold and grumpy, I'm sure. But also, maybe it is not
*  feeling well, because vitamin D deficiency plays a factor in that as well. And I would also like to
*  see something done on whether or not that contributes to how many people get sick over
*  there. Because when I lived in the East Coast, when I lived in New York, I got sick way more
*  than I get sick out here. I'm for sure healthier, more cognizant, definitely more proactive.
*  I think all of those things play a role, personally. I think that there's been enough
*  evidence showing that vitamin D plays a role in, particularly, respiratory infections.
*  Psychosocial stress, like stress, cortisol, that dampens the immune system. So when you are stressed,
*  you're basically not in a good situation to fight off, as you were mentioning with your friend.
*  When you're stressed out, your immune system is dampened, and you are more susceptible to illness,
*  for sure. And that's also known. So I think all those things, and then the sleep.
*  Yeah, that's why it's so rough with all these people stuck inside and stressed out. All the
*  financial pressures that people are experiencing right now because of the lockdown.
*  Yeah, it's so awful. Yeah, it is horrible.
*  It's horrible, and it's not getting better. I just hope that we can reopen the economy in a very
*  safe manner, where we don't have flare-ups that we don't want to be set back to shelter in place
*  again, like, full on. I'm not going to do it again. I'm definitely not going to do it the way it was
*  before. If it's the same disease, I don't think it's warranted. It doesn't make any sense to me.
*  Well, not if the numbers are like right now.
*  Right. I think social distancing makes sense. I think sanitizing, making sure you're using hand
*  sanitizer and cleanliness and all that good stuff. And if you want to wear a mask in public,
*  that makes sense too. Okay, I get it. But this all the nonsense.
*  But masks inside, like inside when you're in places, I think, like if you're going grocery shopping.
*  Yes, sure. But test people. How about that?
*  Absolutely.
*  Test people at work. I mean, I test everyone that comes in here. You told me you'd been tested,
*  and I guess got tested again on Sunday. I tested and I'm clear. And I did that right when I got
*  back from Jacksonville because I'm like, look, I'm in Florida, even though everybody's been tested.
*  I'd like to get tested again. Just for the fuck.
*  Yeah, I'm hoping that the accuracy of the PCR test improves. I don't know if there's like a,
*  but you mentioned one test that might be coming out. I hope that's-
*  Do the saliva-based test. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I don't, you know, I'm not sure.
*  What factor do you think play, like when we're talking about saunas before, one of the things,
*  this is a respiratory disease, and this is something where you're breathing in these
*  particles. And from what I understand, this is a vulnerable virus in terms of the temperature
*  that it can survive in. Obviously, it's in your body. But when, if it's in your nostrils,
*  or if it's in your respiratory tract, and you're breathing in that heated sauna air,
*  does that have any effect at all on viruses? I think that hasn't really been studied.
*  If the virus is like right in your nostrils, I don't know, maybe, but I think it's already
*  like getting, if it's already getting inside the respiratory area, like your body's kind of
*  maintaining homeostasis. So like the heat that you're breathing in-
*  Would you be able to kill some of it off that way though?
*  And reduce the viral load? I don't, I think that-
*  I know you don't want to just speculate. Well, no, I think what's actually, the sauna is
*  actually just, it's improving your immune system. And I think that doing the sauna is making you
*  more resilient against infection. Like that's been shown. There's been small trials showing
*  that people doing a sauna, I forgot the duration, but they were much less likely to come down with
*  a common cold. But they had to be doing it for like at least three months. It wasn't just
*  something that you could, like you're mentioning, at the time of getting it. Also, the respiratory
*  illness connection, there have been correlation studies out of Finland showing that people,
*  actually I think the study was men, only men, that use the sauna two to three times a week.
*  They're 27% less likely to have pneumonia after correcting four. And if they use the sauna four
*  to seven times a week, they're 41% less likely to come down with pneumonia after correcting for
*  socioeconomic status, physical activity, cholesterol, lung, smoking, COPD, like asthma,
*  all those lung disorders. So the sauna does seem to be associated with lower incidence of pneumonia,
*  but it's thought to be because of immune perturbations. And also like the heat shock
*  proteins and all those things like help, there's like an antioxidant effect in the lungs,
*  like things like that. So heat shock proteins also do have antiviral activity against at least
*  influenza A. So the heat shock proteins directly can activate your innate immune system, but they
*  also have antiviral activity against influenza virus. So, you know, I think that the heat
*  stress in the sauna does help. Now there's another study that did look at humidity and the effect of
*  humidity on basically like the ability of your epithelial cells in your airway and nostrils and
*  stuff to filter out particles and particulate matter and like viruses and stuff. And humidity
*  actually made a big difference. Like humidity, like the higher, the more humid, the better that
*  was acting basically able to, you're able to like filter out stuff, whereas dry was like,
*  that makes sense. So it does make sense, but I don't, yeah, I just don't know the answer to
*  your question. I'm not sure. I, when the whole thing started, when the lockdown started, I was
*  getting the sauna really hot. Then I was pouring a bunch of water on it and nose breathing,
*  big, long, deep nose and it was burning. Yeah. But I was doing it too. I was like, I'm killing you
*  bitches. I'm killing all you dirty viruses. And I would take these long deep nose and the whole
*  inside of my nose would be like stinging and everything. But I was like, it's gotta be killing
*  these things. But then, you know, I was talking to a doctor about it and he's like, well, you know,
*  I was like, would it, I was at Austria home, right? Yeah. I was asking him, was it Austria home or was
*  it, but it was a Hotez maybe. Yeah. And he was like, you wouldn't be able to breathe in that
*  temperature. It would, it wouldn't, it wouldn't be hot enough to kill it. I'm like, hmm, maybe
*  the way you do the sauna, like how are you doing the sauna? Like, you know, cause people think
*  about the song, they just think about sitting in there and breathing. No, you're breathing.
*  The steam is hot. I mean, it's burning. But the question is, is like, you know, there's,
*  there's homeostatic processes in these cells and stuff. And so is it actually, I was doing the
*  sauna too hot at one point in time. I was doing it at 210 degrees because of crazy Laird, Laird
*  Hamilton had me convinced. Oh, that's nuts. I did. I've done, I haven't done, um, I have,
*  like I've been to Rick Rubin's house and we've done like, it was like 200 and something barrels on it.
*  He's a Laird Hamilton enthusiast as well. Yeah. Laird, I talk, but like I, I was about to like,
*  go to one of his, I was like, literally going to get on a plane and go to Kauai and I'm like,
*  Laird, I'm doing this XPT thing. I'm bringing my son. We're going to all like make a trip.
*  And this, it was happening in March. Oh, right when it all went down. I was like, okay,
*  one day, one day Laird will do it. One day we'll do it. So he gets in over 200 degrees with a
*  fucking air dyne bike with oven mitts on this crazy asshole is riding an air dyne. And I say
*  crazy asshole with all due respect because I love the guy, but he's riding air dye machine in a
*  fucking sauna. I'm like, bro. I, so I did that 200. I bet you it was the same because they like do
*  the same protocol like, and this was like two 10 or two 20. It was so hot. Like, like, like I,
*  I was, I was like on some kind of a mind altering drug. Like, I was like, and I think that's the
*  point with those guys. It's the other thing that happens is, and then we'd go into this ice bath
*  and there's like this bath right outside and we were like, did all this ice. And like I said,
*  I was like trying to oppress Rick. So I was like staying in the ice bath long as I could, you know,
*  gotta, you gotta think I'm cool. So I get back into the sauna and, and like getting back into
*  this like 210 or 20 degree sauna and you feel like it's like room temperature. Cause you were
*  just in this ice bath. It's the weirdest feeling. And then you do that. Like we did it like three
*  or four times. I don't remember, but, but I was like, I started out the conversation. I was like,
*  he tried proteins and I was like talking science. And at the end of the conversation,
*  I was just spilling everything. I was like, I was just telling them all those, it was just
*  kind of, you open up basically. What were you saying? I don't remember, but I wasn't talking
*  science. Talking about life. I was talking about life. One day we're all going to die and then
*  the sun's going to explode and it's going to create carbon. It's going to create more life forms.
*  I think, I think, uh, Gabby Gabby, uh, Larry's wife. Um, she, she has a podcast early. She did.
*  I don't know if she still does. It's called like the truth barrel or something. It was at one time.
*  I don't know if the name's changed or not, but I thought that was so awesome because she named it
*  after like the sauna because the truth comes out. You just start talking like, you know,
*  it's intense. There's my eye watering. But anyways, 210 degrees. I was finding that it was
*  burning my throat and I think I was doing it too often too. It was burning my ears and my head.
*  So we were, it was dry for us. So I wasn't, I wasn't experiencing that as much, but, um,
*  I had to like get on the floor because like, I felt like my hair was going to fall out. Like it
*  was just burnt, you know, it was just so hot. And so he gave me a hat. So I don't remember. We were,
*  I mean, I was like trying to like,
*  what is the benefit of it being that hot though? Is there any benefit to that over one 80?
*  Oh, well, I mean, I think that you could just stay in for so the, so the thing,
*  so the thing is, is that like with most of the studies that have been done looking at the benefits
*  on cardiovascular health and all, you know, cause mortality, it's quite a bit lower. It's like 20
*  minutes at 174 degrees. But you know, if you're, if you're, if you're at 210, you can't stay in
*  there for 25 minutes or 20 minutes. I mean, I guess eventually you adapt. We were in there,
*  I was in there for, I don't know how long. And then I'd go in the ice back and then go back in
*  there. But, um, I would get out and I would collapse. You were actually in there for 20 minutes.
*  Oh yeah. At 210 degrees. And I would get out and I would go out to the mats out there and just
*  collapse. Yeah. That sounds like too much. It felt like too much. Do you, do you do like electrolyte
*  replenishment? Like, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I take a liquid IV actually. Oh, okay. Yeah. Liquid IV is a
*  great electrolyte supplement that I take, but you know what I found works popcorn popcorn. Why?
*  I'm just kidding. Sodium. It's like my cheat. I like love, I love like, I love popcorn too, but boy,
*  I wear a continuous glucose monitor. That thing will go to like 165, like just from like, you know,
*  just from the corn, just from the popcorn. They're like, and I'm typically like, you know,
*  I'm typically like my, my meals that are like, you know, low carb, like I usually like, I eat more
*  like a paleo ish diet, you know, so it's like meat and vegetables. Like, you know, I don't, my meals
*  don't get me over a hundred for sure. Most of the time popcorn popcorn, popcorn will spike it really
*  bad. Um, certain things will spike it worse than others, but, but that, that popcorn sure, it sure
*  tastes good. You know, it's a good electrolyte, I guess with the sodium salt. It's so good with
*  salt and butter, right? Oh man. So delicious. I don't, who figured out that's the perfect food
*  for, for movies. We can only eat it in our office though, cause we have a two and a half year old
*  and it's like a big choke. It's like the number one choking popcorn is like the number one choking.
*  Oh, I can only imagine, right? The kernel. So like, yeah, yeah. I, I choke on it sometimes. Yeah.
*  Um, the, the thing about the sauna at 210 degrees to one of the things that was happening to me,
*  I was getting headaches and my throat was burning. Like the next, I was coughing a lot, like,
*  like, and I was like, I think I'm fucking up the actual tissue in my throat. Oh man. Cause when you
*  cook a brisket, like you cook a brisket at like 210. That's not 220. The headaches, I think is a
*  sign that you've, you've pushed it too hard. Yeah. I was doing a lot too. That's intense. 20 minutes
*  into that 210. I got addicted to it. I got, I get addicted sometimes to things that are really hard
*  to do. Like it just like, so in my mind I'm like, cause it's so hard to stay in there for 20 minutes
*  at 210 degrees. I mean, it hurts. Everything hurts. Your skin hurts. Your toes hurt.
*  Like it hurts. And then, so then the next day I would like look forward to doing it to see if I
*  could do it easier again. And then I'm like in this weird loop that my own brain creates, which is
*  really bad, that I'm very addicted to trying to conquer things. Yeah. I'm a bit that way. Yeah. So
*  that was the thing. And then, but then I took a step back. I was like, I think I'm fucking myself
*  up here. 180, 180 is great. I like 180 Fahrenheit for sure. Yeah. Have I, have I told you my xylitol
*  story? I wanted to tell you this. Do you chew gum? I know you do. I remember like after show, like you
*  chew gum, right? Sure. Do you use xylitol gum? I don't think so. Oh my God, you have to do it.
*  What is so good about xylitol? So I'm going to tell you my story. Xylitol is, it's like a sugar substitute.
*  Xylitol is from birch. It's from the birch plant we were just talking about. It's the natural,
*  it's naturally found in plants. So it's that birch, you know what they're whipping? It's from that
*  plant. It, yes, it is used as a, like if you're eating it, you know, I think it could cause like,
*  like the urethra tall kind of thing effect where it's like too much GI distress. But when you're
*  chewing gum or using toothpaste, these many studies have shown that it kills anaerobic bacteria like
*  streptococcus, coctus mutans that cause cavities and dental decay. Really? So, so here's my story,
*  like multiple studies in humans showing this. It's like a big deal. So I went to, this is before I was,
*  before I had my son, I went to the dentist. My dentist is a really, he's great. And he did an
*  x-ray. We were doing a cleaning, you know, that's a hygiene thing. And, and he comes back and he's
*  like, you've got two cavities. And I was like, how the hell do I have cavities? I don't need sugar.
*  Like, you know, I've just, I've got like a bad oral microbiome or something that I've just for,
*  for years. I don't know. I shouldn't have cavities because I don't need sugar. But anyways, I had,
*  so he goes, you have two cavities. They're at the point of no return where, you know, like you,
*  they're, I guess they penetrate the enamel a certain amount and they're like, you have to,
*  you have to like get them out. And so the way I am is I always like to like look into everything
*  before I do anything. It's like, okay, this is not my field. I understand. I told him I'm like,
*  I'm going to do some reading research and see if I can find, you know, if there's any, you know,
*  possibility that I don't have to like get a filling. Right. And he's like, okay, well,
*  if you find anything, please send it my way. So, so then I found out I was pregnant. And I was,
*  so I was like, okay, well, I can't go back to the dentist. And at that point, I, I was like,
*  looking through everything, all my toiletries and everything, like, what do I have to get rid of?
*  What's in there that could be harmful? And so I was like fluoride, like in my toothpaste. So I was
*  like, I don't want to use fluoride toothpaste anymore. And these stories are going to connect.
*  But so fluoride fluoride has been shown a lot of people worried about the effects on the brain.
*  The only solid evidence I could find on negative effects of fluoride on the brain are in utero,
*  meaning pregnant women, you know, and the effects on babies. And I don't know if toothpaste has
*  enough to even do anything. But in my mind, I was like, nope, getting rid of the fluoride,
*  you know, I got a, I got a water filter that got rid of the fluoride in the water. And I was like,
*  doing all that. So I came across this xylitol toothpaste. I was like, what is this xylitol
*  toothpaste? So I started doing research on xylitol while I was looking for alternatives. So I was
*  like, Tom's the man. I can't use that crap. I've tried it before. It's like, it's like, my teeth
*  get dirtier. I hate that stuff. It tastes so terrible. Makes your breath smell worse.
*  Anyway, so I was like, I've got to find something other than Tom's the main. So I came across this
*  xylitol stuff and I started doing research and then I found all these studies. And not only did
*  I find studies that like, it, you know, basically kills these bacteria that cause cavities, the S
*  mutants, pregnant women that chew xylitol gum, by the way, the studies were with gum, not the
*  toothpaste, the people were chewing this gum. And pregnant women, like if they were like six months
*  pregnant, the study started at six months and they chewed this xylitol gum all the way up until
*  anywhere between the child, you know, the baby being six months. And there were some studies that
*  went out like a year. And then they met the, the, the researchers measured the oral bacteria of the
*  toddlers and then they measured them multiple years out as they became children. And the mothers
*  chewing it, chewing the gum, it lowered the incidence of the S mutants in the children.
*  Because, you know, mothers kiss their kids and you transfer oral bacteria. And so they're like,
*  they're chewing the xylitol gum had a positive effect on the child's oral microbiome. And I was
*  like, fuck yeah, I'm going to do this. I was like, I gave myself TMJ, like I chewed so much xylitol
*  gum while I was pregnant. And like, I still like to this day, I chew, I have some with me right now,
*  but TMJ is, am I saying the right thing? Like, it was like popping my jaw was, I was eating a lot
*  of sauteed kale and chewing a lot of xylitol gum when I was pregnant. And so, but it totally fixed
*  itself, thankfully. So anyways, a year goes by, I have, I have my son eventually I'm like, okay,
*  I gotta go back to Dennis because you know, pregnancy makes your teeth worse. There's like
*  all this stuff about you bleeding your gums bleed. There's like, there's some kind of term where like
*  women get like, like, what's that periodontitis or gingivitis, one of those two. It's bad. Anyways,
*  so I go back to Dennis, we do the x-rays and I'm like, oh, you're gonna tell me about the stupid
*  cavities and I haven't done the research. You know, and he goes, he comes in and he goes,
*  I've never seen this before, but your cavities are gone. He shows the x-rays and he shows me
*  before and after he's like, they're totally gone. And, and I was like, that's amazing.
*  I was like, is it the pregnancy? Did he's like, no, he's like, we get women coming in here after
*  pain, it's like worse. And I said, the only thing that I did, like I could think of is like my
*  obsessive xylitol gum chewing, which I still do. And the fact that it does decrease the, you know,
*  I don't know how it would affect an already formed cavity, but my cavities are gone. So my doctor,
*  my dentist is great because he like, you know, any dentist could just be like, nope, they're still
*  there. Like, I don't know what the x-rays will still look like. So, so I feel like he's a
*  trustworthy guy. I like that. But isn't that crazy? You have to worry about shifty dentists.
*  Yeah, but you do. Anyone right? Right. So that is crazy. So the xylitol gum somehow. So you think
*  that what it did was affect your, the microbiome of your mouth. Oh, and it's showed, there's also
*  studies showing that it decreases the incidence of I said, I'm talking about staphylococcus mutans,
*  because it's the only one I remember, but there's another one that causes dental decay, but it
*  didn't affect any of the good bacteria in the mouth. Wow. So, so it was like, now I'm just like,
*  staphylococcus mutans, that's the same. Is that the same family that you get from staph infections?
*  No, no different stuff. Yeah. Okay. But I mean, there's lots of different staphylococcus
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, but so it's a, so there's a gum Joe, you need to get on it.
*  It's really awesome. Like it's, I really think it's, we already are that gum. We've been chewing
*  as I'll tell on it. Oh, the neuro gum. Oh, okay. I've been chewing this neuro gum. That is,
*  it's gum with nootropics in it. Nootropics. Yes. Like plank. So I was like, I was like eating a
*  bunch of ECG, ECG, and cocoa cocoa via like capsules, like the, the, the catechins and the
*  dark dark chocolate for mine. What's in it? L Thianine. See, I was looking for my L Thianine,
*  but I was out because that like helps calm me. It's got a little bit of caffeine, L Thianine and
*  B vitamins. I fucking love it. I love it. I take it before I do kickboxing workouts. I chew gum.
*  I used to, I used to, sorry, it was neuro. Yeah. Yeah. As B6 and B12 also.
*  That looks interesting. I, I used to take when I was like doing long distance running,
*  I was running like eight to 10 miles a day. And I was doing that like, I was probably running about
*  50 miles a week, which is pretty good. You know, this was like when I was in my early 20s,
*  but I would like dose up on all these like B complex vitamins. And I swear I would just,
*  I would have endurance just for sure. I don't know if it was like placebo or not, but like
*  B12 was a big impact on your ability to do work. You think so? Oh yeah, for sure. I haven't done
*  any research on it, but I just know that I used to take them and I felt like a big effect. I don't
*  know. Yeah. B12 shots. You ever get a B12 shot? I did. So the, I, the intravenous vitamin C I got,
*  I think it had B12 in it. If you're run down B12 shots give you an awesome little boost.
*  Yeah. But I haven't done like a specific B12 shot. This stuff's pretty good. I don't feel any like,
*  that's not going to get you high. I don't feel anything weird. So no, isn't that, isn't CBD
*  supposed to like also be like calming? Yes. It relieves anxiety. Yeah. Yeah. You just got to get
*  a good CBD, like a good CBD that doesn't have THC. Cause I have a few that I've tried from other
*  con the, the tincture that I take is from CBD MD and it doesn't get me high at all. But I've had
*  some from other companies where I'd have like three drop-ups full and I'm like, Oh, okay. Does it help
*  your sleep? Yes. Or does the THC, is the, or do you require a THC for the sleep? No. Different people
*  have different results when it comes to CBD. And some people find that CBD with THC benefits them
*  more. And some people find that it's just the CBD itself, but CBD MD, the company that I use,
*  what I really like is they have a bunch of muscle creams and like stuff that you rub on the outside
*  of sore muscles. That stuff's fantastic. It's really good penetrates into the skin and just
*  really good at alleviating soreness. And I had a, so like one of my old colleagues, science colleagues
*  was telling me that like they were measuring some samples from like different CBD products and like
*  majority of them didn't actually even have much CBD in them at all. Like there's just a lot of,
*  I mean, you know, this has been shown with vitamin supplements as well. There's been so many studies
*  showing like even vitamin D supplements, like it'll say it has 10,000 IU, but it only has like 6,000.
*  Like there's been sampling where you like, you go to like Walgreens or CBS or, you know,
*  you're just whatever random place and grab the vitamin. They don't have the concentration and
*  isn't high. Also those like echinacea things, like a lot of it's just cloverleaf. Like it's just
*  clover, like because it's not regulated. I mean, not, I don't think... Is echinacea kind of
*  bullshit anyway? Like what does that do for you? You know, it's supposed to jack up your immune
*  system. That's what everybody always told me that they were all sick all the time.
*  People are vegetarian, but they were zinc deficient taking echinacea.
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, I know. I haven't looked into the echinacea. Someone,
*  someone asked me about the elderberry. So I looked into that and cause I was like,
*  is that like an echinacea thing? But there's some actual legitimate research elderberry like has
*  been shown in random ice controlled trials to like effect the immune system and lower cold
*  duration and stuff like that. You know, so... Are you a fan of kombucha? Do you drink that?
*  I'm a fan of kombucha. I used to drink, what is the one I drink? The dark one, ginger lemon,
*  darn, I can't remember the name. GTS?
*  No, I used to, but then they're, they are sugar. The sugar in that one's too much. So the one that
*  I drink is two grams per serving and there's two servings. So there's only four grams of sugar.
*  The sugar though is what helps the fermentation and helps the fungus grow, right?
*  I think this, this, the GT one that had like eight grams. So it was like twice as much. And the other,
*  and the ginger lemon one, I like the ginger lemon a lot. And I'm like, this one tastes better. So...
*  The ginger lemon does? Yeah. The one that I'm getting, it's like,
*  it's found at like Whole Foods and Sprouts and it's in a dark bottle.
*  Does it have the same amount of active culture though? Like that's the question.
*  I don't know. It's in a dark bottle. You once told me dark bottles better.
*  Well, the dark bottle is better in kombucha because it doesn't ferment in the sun as well.
*  It doesn't, the sun doesn't penetrate it. Okay. Almost like a UV protector.
*  Gut microbiome health is important for immune function. It really is. Like,
*  that's another thing we're talking about. Yeah, I love kimchi.
*  Oh yeah, I love kimchi. I eat the shit out of that stuff. I love it.
*  So I, what's the brand? I get it. I buy it. I buy it from Sprouts or Whole Foods.
*  Mother-in-law's. Mother-in-law. That's the one I get. That's what I get.
*  We have some here. Yeah. I love that stuff. I'm a giant fan. It's so delicious too.
*  And I love it with meat. Meat.
*  We've been like, we have a bunch of Elk Burger we ordered online.
*  Ordered online? No, no, no, no. I'll give you some.
*  Yeah, but I mean, I hadn't come here. Why you're here? I'm going to stock you up.
*  We were like you early on. We were just like, we bought freezers. I was like,
*  I need the Elk Burger. I need all the Orchid Beats. I need everything.
*  But I'm just so thankful that it's not as bad. I really am.
*  Yeah, I'm thankful as well. But I think our government needs to make an adjustment.
*  They need to recognize that it's not as bad and start opening things up. But there's so
*  many people that are just, the sky's falling, the sky's falling still. They're still saying it.
*  They're still screaming from the rooftops. People are dying. People are dying every day
*  from everything. Like you said, testing too. I think that's going to make a big difference.
*  And I think people will become less scared as these therapeutics do emerge, which they will.
*  I'm sure. Absolutely. But what I really wanted to talk to you,
*  the reason why I wanted to bring you in here is this conversation that we just had to talk about
*  what are the methods you can use to help boost your immune system, keep your body healthy.
*  I think we kind of got it dialed in. So vitamin D seems to be very critical. Sauna if you have it.
*  If you don't, bath. Vitamin C. Orally, you need a big dose and it's still not going to have the
*  same effect. If you can do IV, you don't need to do it but once a week. Anything else? Zinc.
*  Zinc. Zinc. Plus quercetin for your... Quercetin.
*  And then sleep. Sleep, giant.
*  And microbiome health. Do you use anything to help you sleep in terms of like a meditation
*  app or do you... So I use melatonin.
*  Okay. Why do you say it that way?
*  I used to not. So I have a history of night terrors.
*  And it... What does that mean?
*  Well, it's like when I'm stressed out, particularly it flares up, and it happens like when I'm,
*  I think when I'm shifting from one sleep stage to the next where I am asleep but somehow I wake up
*  but I'm not awake and I can still... But I'm moving my body and I think that someone's in
*  the room and that they're going to come get me and I freak out and I scream. And it's happened
*  where I... I scared Dan, of course. He's like in the middle of the sleep. And it happens earlier
*  in my sleep cycle. So it's like... But I... So I started doing... I started reading about this
*  stuff and it's like, I don't want to... Like the treatments were like benzos. I'm like, how am I
*  not going to take benzos? That's, you know, been shown to like cause dementia, right?
*  Yeah. So...
*  That stuff's terrible.
*  Terrible. And it's so hard to get off.
*  And also like, yes, it's very addictive. And then like if you, if you become addicted to it,
*  I mean, it can like, you can like go through serious, like you can die.
*  Well, Jordan Peterson just went through all this and literally had to go...
*  With benzos?
*  Yes. And went to Russia to have some sort of crazy medical detox.
*  That's awful.
*  He's still suffering from it. He's not even ready to work. He's been fucked up for like a year.
*  It's really bad. Wow. That sucks.
*  Yeah.
*  So I didn't want to do that. But there was, there was some studies showing that high dose melatonin,
*  you know, more in the like 10 milligram range. So I'm taking nine milligrams a night and I totally
*  stopped having them for the most part. Dan says, yeah, like I went through one episode where
*  what happens when someone has a night terror is like if someone else in the bed,
*  sharing the bed with you, like tries to stop you or help, like because I'm still asleep,
*  I'm not aware that that's my husband doing that. And I really think someone's trying to get me.
*  And so I just go into like crazy mode. And I like, I like somehow like crawled from our bedroom all
*  the way out to the living room. And by the time I woke up, I mean, I had bruised myself. I was like,
*  how would I get out here? You know, like this was like the worst, this was the worst that's ever
*  happened to me. So usually I just kind of scream and wake up and like, I'm like, like I think
*  someone's going to get me, you know, melatonin totally, totally stops it. Totally stops it.
*  I measure, I track my sleep as well. And I think that, you know, I don't know the sleep stage stuff
*  and how accurate that is. I think it's not very accurate, but duration is pretty accurate. So,
*  so what do you not think is accurate? Like telling me like how much time I'm in deep sleep versus
*  monitor that our or ring. Oh, I don't think that's accurate. I think that the, I don't think the
*  sleep stage is accurate. Why is that? Because like that's like, you have to like measure brain
*  wave. Like it's measuring it's, I'll tell you why, because I've had multiple incidents when I was
*  nursing my son back when I was nursing my son, where he was on a nursing pill. And I'm very
*  relaxed. Of course I'm nursing him, right? I'm making oxytocin and I'm like scrolling on my
*  phone reading and it calculated me as being in REM sleep. And it happened, it happened more than
*  once. There's other times. So Dan and I don't, we don't have a TV in our room bedroom, but when we
*  go travel, we're in a hotel, we're in bed. So we're laying in bed watching a show and I'm like,
*  totally relaxed in bed. And it's totally putting me as calculating me as asleep. So I'm like, you
*  know, you know, it, it calculates heart rate and movement and body temperature. So, you know, I,
*  I like it. I do. I just, I don't think that it's totally accurate and measuring my only real way
*  to measure that as those little suction cup things they put on your head. Yeah, right. I did a sleep
*  study once because I have sleep apnea. So you do. Yeah. So I had to do that. Do you do a CPAP or
*  no, I have a, I got a mouthpiece. It's amazing. Yeah. It's a mouthpiece. Can you tell me what it
*  is? Cause my father-in-law has apnea and like, um, there's a doctor, Dr. Caropian. He's a very
*  wacky guy. Caropian. Yeah. Am I supposed to write that down? Is that gonna, if I look them up?
*  Yeah, you could find it. Brian Caropian and he's in, um, Tarzana. Yeah. I'm pretty sure he's in
*  Tarzana. Uh, he used to be out here. Well, he was in Tarzana and then I think he might've moved to
*  Sherman Oaks. Anyway, you'll find it. Um, I'll find it. I'll find it. I'll send it to you. But anyway,
*  he, uh, devised a mouthpiece that has like a little tongue depressor. And for me, my problem is my,
*  my neck is very thick. There it is. What is a, yeah, full breath solution. CPAPalternative.com.
*  Yeah. It's, um, the idea is a lot of people have a problem with CPAPs. They, they, it's uncomfortable.
*  You're wearing a mask over your face. That's how I felt. And so this mouthpiece, the Sleep
*  Apnea mouthpiece, it sits in my mouth and the tongue depressor keeps my tongue from sliding back
*  and closing my airway. Wow. It makes a big difference. Did you go in? So I, I, I was,
*  okay, you did go in. So I had- Yeah, I went in, I had a sleep study done.
*  Wow. And it was bad. It's hard to sleep probably when you're in those, right? Like you're-
*  It is, but I did sleep, you know, because I was, I was sleep deprived. That's what it looks like.
*  So see, it sits in and that little tongue thing pushes down, uh, on your, your actual tongue.
*  Does it have to get fit like a- Yeah. Like a-
*  Yeah. You go in there and they, they do molds and stuff.
*  Exactly. Yeah. It makes a big difference. Wow. That's awesome. I've gone places and
*  forgot it and I panic. I'm like, fuck. Yeah. I mean, like not being able to breathe. Yeah.
*  So that's a, that's a huge thing. I thought I had that at first because I was like,
*  am I just like freaking out because I'm like not getting enough oxygen or something, you know,
*  but I, they had me do a pulse oxymoron thing and at least that's what-
*  Wrestlers and athletes, football players get it because your neck muscles get really big.
*  And when your neck muscles get big, if you have a big tongue and I have a big tongue,
*  when I lay down, it closes the airway. So my tongue slides. Oh yeah. I know it's associated
*  with obesity. Yes. Yes. Well, they get fat and all this extra tissue. That's one of the ways that
*  they, there's operations that they do to try to alleviate it. And they just cut out some of the
*  tissue inside your mouth. And then they also cut out your- If you could avoid surgery. Exactly.
*  So if you don't wear it- Because I wouldn't be able to talk for like a month.
*  Right. If you don't wear it, do you snore? Oh, like crazy.
*  But when you wear it, you don't snore. I don't snore at all. Yeah.
*  Your wife must love it. She loves it. Yeah. Before it was awful.
*  And I also choke. I'd be like, I can't breathe, you know, because I, my body's forcing to adjust.
*  I remember I was on a plane once and there was this guy behind me and he was a kind of a heavy
*  fellow and he was, he was really snoring loud. He was laying on his back and really snoring loud.
*  And then he would go without breathing for multiple seconds. And I filmed him and I,
*  I told him when he woke up, I go, Hey man, I go, do you know you have sleep apnea? And he's like,
*  no, I go, listen, I go, I haven't too. I go, but you got to do something about it. I go,
*  you hold your breath for long periods of time. He goes, really? I go, I'm going to show you.
*  Yeah. So I showed him. He's like, fuck. And I go, yeah, dude, this is really bad. It's associated
*  with so many different things. It's associated with high blood pressure, heart attacks, the risk
*  of all sorts of ailments. Plus you're just not sleeping enough. You're not getting real sleep
*  because you're constantly being woken up and shocked into this state of like, no, it's really
*  bad. It's bad for you. And it's bad for your spouse. Like my mother-in-law has to go, she goes
*  into the guest room to sleep like after they go to bed because she can't sleep. Like it's really bad.
*  Do you have to do the sleep study to get the, Oh man, I wanted to kill that guy.
*  You have no idea. It was like, I could just stop him. Like, I'm sure. Yeah. It was like
*  having someone that snores is like, you can't sleep. No, you can't sleep. And I can't wear it.
*  My ears are like earplugs. First of all, they're not comfortable for me. I have really tiny ear
*  canals and I just like, I can't, some people can sleep with earplugs. Like I just can't. It's
*  uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable. Yeah. Snoring is a real issue and it's usually an issue of,
*  you know, some sort of an impeded airway. Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad I don't have that,
*  but the night terror thing, I'm just the melatonin is helped. So that's great. Yeah.
*  Anything else? Has anything else helped you for sleeping? Yeah. Oh, I mean, I think that, that
*  going, so basically like having a good circadian rhythm and, and like bright light exposure in the
*  early morning, like it really does help. Like there was a time when I would, you know, like I lived in,
*  in Oakland, I was just in this dark little apartment and you know, like it just wasn't
*  really great for my circadian rhythm because I would wake up in the morning, especially like on
*  weekends and stuff. Like, you know, there's like no light coming in and I didn't, I wasn't, I didn't
*  live in a place that was like, I could just go outside and frolic, you know, right. So, so.
*  Frolic and Oakland don't really go together that well. Yeah. But yeah, bright light exposure, big
*  to big, it was like a huge thing and the red light. So I have, I do the Phillips hue where at like
*  five o'clock all the lights in our house go red. That makes a huge impact on my son and his sleep
*  cycle. Like because children are really sensitive to light because they don't have like cataracts
*  and stuff. And so the melon, they're, they're like, you know, that melatonin is not being produced.
*  So like if we go travel or go to my in-laws or something, they have the lights on, I'm like
*  going around the house, turning them all off. Cause I'm like, I want my son to go to bed at a normal
*  hour. Do you watch, do you, if you're looking at your screens, do you use blue light blocking
*  glasses? So I have like all the apps and stuff and most of the time, like, and I turn my, my,
*  iPhone screen is like down and they have the black background and all that. But no, I don't wear
*  glasses. I just, yeah, those are great. You should look into that blue light. I might have to, because
*  when I actually get a chance to watch TV, like it doesn't happen much because right now my son
*  falls asleep at like nine and he wakes up at six. And so like, Jesus, I have to go to bed immediately
*  after he does. So I'm like, wondering when do I, when can I cut the nap out? Like I'm Googling
*  everything, you know, just trying to figure it all out. It's like, you know, you have to keep
*  napping until they're three. I don't know. I gotta like do some more reading because like,
*  it's not, that's not uniform. I know my youngest didn't never want to take naps. She's like,
*  fuck off staying awake. Oh, my son doesn't want to take, he doesn't want to sleep ever.
*  He wants to party all day, every day, man. He's like, it'll start to be,
*  he's, it starts to like get a dusk and he's like, it's still daytime.
*  It's still daytime. And I'm like, for a little bit, it's going to be nighttime soon.
*  What about if you get him active, if he exercises? Yeah. Well, it's, we used to go to soccer class
*  and stuff and go to the park, but it's hard with the shelter in place right now. He's probably got
*  a lot of pent up energy. So we've been doing like, yeah. So I've been trying to like take him,
*  you know, like we do like hide and seek and run, run, run, wear him out. But you know, I think,
*  I think the bright light exposure for him, you know, taking him out in the morning is really
*  important. And now that like, cause we, you know, now, now I'm able to do that more. Like I feel
*  safer. I like, you know, like, so, um, especially being outside, I don't, I'm not, not as concerned.
*  So like, I think that's really important for bright light exposure is just, there's just study after
*  study showing it sets your circadian clock. Boom. It's like, okay, this isn't, this is, this is like
*  the morning and your circadian clock starts. And then, you know, so you become sleepy when you're
*  supposed to come become sleepy, as long as you're not in tons of bright light at night. Um, but
*  that's been probably the biggest thing, by the way, you know, what's actually, I was talking about
*  my glucose monitor, my continuous glucose monitor. We were talking about popcorn. You know, the
*  biggest thing that really affected my glucose levels wasn't popcorn. It was actually lack of sleep.
*  Yeah. Big time effect. Like particularly if I wasn't exercising, like, like almost pre-diabetic
*  level fasting blood glucose, like when this is, this is when my sleep was being disrupted when like
*  my son was like younger. So I've been wearing my continuous glucose monitor for a year and a half,
*  maybe two years. How do you wear this? What is it? Mine's, mine's right here. Oh, you have a little
*  patch that you wear on you all the time. You're not diabetic, right? No, no. Cause I've seen a guy who
*  wears one of those, but he's diabetic. Yeah. I mean, I, I'm wearing it because I'm sort of trying to,
*  um, understand how different foods have different lifestyle changes, like how long you've been
*  wearing it. Um, I got it probably right after the last time I was on here. Okay. Right. Literally.
*  Yeah. Just constantly wear it for years then. I've been wearing, yeah, it's been over, it's been
*  almost maybe two years, almost two years, a year and a half. But, um, I most of the time constantly
*  wear it sometimes because it only, it's like a, the sensor lasts for 10 days and I have to change it.
*  And sometimes I like forget and a couple of days go by and then I start like eating the pomegranate
*  cause my son loves it. I'm like, I wonder what this is doing to my glucose. But the lack of sleep,
*  because he would wake up, like I would be getting interrupted multiple times at night, like, you know,
*  where it was like, I don't know, he was going through some developmental stage and he would stand
*  in his crib. And it's like, so I was, I was getting woken up multiple times at night for like prolonged
*  periods, very, very like fragmented sleep. And I was nothing had changed with my diet and my blood
*  glucose, my fasting blood glucose levels. If I'm, if my exercise routines dialed in, I'm not like
*  shelter in place, you know, um, it's about, you know, mid eighties. Um, and so I was up like,
*  I was up to like when fasting blood glucose would get up sometimes to like, if I wouldn't exercise
*  like one, I'm like wake up in the morning and I'm like 106, 107, 109. So, and then big, and it was
*  repeatable. Why is the lack of sleep causing so many studies published. We did a video on it and
*  like it's, I mean, it affects like the, the insulin secretion sensitivity, like all that stuff. It's
*  all being affected. So it's one of the reasons why, like, you know, shift shift workers, they're like,
*  really are prone to type two diabetes. They really are. So sleep is so important, but I thought
*  poor people, that has gotta be one of the worst things for your body. Nurses, like their doctors,
*  the first responders, anybody who's working that late shift, Dan, Dan had a, his appendix removed,
*  like he, so he had, um, it's this crazy story, but you probably have to go.
*  How crazy is it? Um, well, it's pretty crazy actually. So he had this appendix thing happen.
*  We were visiting his parents in Memphis and it was like Christmas Eve. And so he had to go to the
*  hospital. He's like, it's bad. I need to go to the hospital. So we went to the hospital. They're like,
*  yeah, you have appendicitis, but he didn't feel comfortable getting it removed there. Cause there's
*  just a bunch of factors that doc wasn't this doctor, like, you know, all that stuff. So, um,
*  he got this antibiotic treatment. They're like, sent him home a couple of days later, he got some
*  IV treatment and then, uh, it came back like a couple of months later or like a few months later
*  back when we were home. But he was like, all of a sudden, like the first time he had it, he was
*  just like pain. I should go something's wrong. The second time he was like vomiting and like,
*  you know, you know, I didn't want to like, I had, my son was sleeping. It was like two in the morning.
*  He woke me up. So, um, you know, we called the first, I called the ambulance. I was just like,
*  you know, he's vomiting. I don't know if it's a ruptured, you know, cause it could be serious.
*  But anyways, these first, my whole point was the first responders, they came and they were just like,
*  yeah, we don't ever sleep. Like it's like, we don't ever sleep. It's just so awful for them.
*  Terrible for you. So anybody's working the late shift. God, that's gotta be so bad for you.
*  I used to deliver newspapers. So every morning I was up at five o'clock in the morning and I was
*  also doing comedy. So I was going to bed really late at night and I was just always tired. I just,
*  I would just, I would be sitting here. I just boom, fall asleep. That's awful. Yeah. It was
