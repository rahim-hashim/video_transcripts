# JRE MMA Show #155 with Max Holloway
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srRQQXoPqGg)
*  Have you ever had to deal with jet lag for a fight?
*  No, not really.
*  I mean, we try to go up early, that's why.
*  So the first two days is whatever, but then after that we're all good.
*  Where's the furthest that you had to fly to to fight?
*  I think so Abu Dhabi, fight island.
*  So how long does that take to adjust?
*  Brother, that one was weird because then you remember they had us fighting at weird times.
*  So we had to sleep during the day and then train during the night.
*  I remember going to sleep around 8 or 9 o'clock a.m.
*  Yeah, because we was fighting around that time, early in the morning.
*  So that was insane.
*  So you had to get your body acclimated to that?
*  Acclimated, yep.
*  That's got to play a factor, right?
*  If you live in Abu Dhabi, that would be a big advantage.
*  Oh, for sure, for sure.
*  I mean, did you not just see the July card that got announced in the UK?
*  3 a.m., brother.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  Is the main card start.
*  So they're saying whoever's main headline is fighting at 6 a.m.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's insane.
*  You know how drunk that audience is going to be?
*  Brother, you see.
*  Great.
*  I saw, you know what is funny?
*  I saw a clip, a meme of a video of a UK fan.
*  He's living in the UK.
*  He watched our fight.
*  Our fight just got done.
*  Mine's in Justin.
*  He played our clip.
*  And then he was like, great, now I can start my morning.
*  He opened the door.
*  It's light out and stuff.
*  I'm like, holy shit.
*  Yeah, they have to deal with different.
*  I mean, it's funny.
*  The American pay-per-view time schedule just trumps everything.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, crazy.
*  I guess we're the ones who buy it the most.
*  I wonder what the numbers are in the rest of the world.
*  I think UK is another hot spot, right?
*  And UK is big.
*  I mean, there are some fight fans to be doing that every, you know, once a month, they're
*  planning a pay-per-view card and they're like, look, honey, 3 a.m. I'm probably going
*  to be screaming, so please don't divorce me.
*  So it's pretty awesome.
*  Yeah, you just got to get one tolerant wife and have everybody go over to that house.
*  Yeah, be like, hey, guys, or you get the single friend, you know, you know, one of the guys
*  that he's just single, you don't have nothing going on.
*  He's like, yeah, you come to my house.
*  Yeah, that's perfect.
*  So what has it been like for you after 300?
*  I mean, it seems like I think for whatever reason, people go through phases of their
*  career and with some fighters, if a fighter gets a loss or two, they start to think that
*  that fighter has started to decline.
*  Uh huh.
*  And with you, I think some people had written you off for some strange reason.
*  Brother.
*  I don't get it.
*  I heard the noise.
*  I heard it.
*  I heard the noise.
*  I'm like, listen, he's only 32.
*  Yeah, 32.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  He's only 32.
*  That's athletic prime.
*  I'm like, there's not no beatings.
*  There's no knockouts.
*  There's no like there's no decline in the expression of skills inside the octagon.
*  Everything looks the same and better every fight.
*  You know what the problem is?
*  The problem is that I got these guys got to see me grow up.
*  You know, I got in the UFC when I was 20 years old and a lot of people think I'm DC's old
*  ass 42 years old or something.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And then I'm like, brother, I'm not DC.
*  I've been calling out DC, but I'm a young guy, you know, just because I've been harassing
*  his his potato looking butt.
*  Like, come on, bag of potato looking ass.
*  I'm too together.
*  Hilarious.
*  Brother, I love that guy.
*  I love that guy.
*  He's the best.
*  A lot of guys think I'm old because I've been fighting since I was 20.
*  And then it wasn't and it's not like I've been fighting 20.
*  I've been fighting since I was 20 and I fought a who's who in in in my division.
*  You know, the best in the world since you were 20 years old, just past teenager.
*  Yeah.
*  So like especially with the you know, with the Vogue fights, you know, it's like that
*  the first two fights was was was all right.
*  And the third fight is what made everybody go, oh, he's done for.
*  I'm like, brother, like that was his Vogue's night.
*  He was on. You know what I mean?
*  Like it is what it is.
*  Everybody's like, oh, yeah, look, look at Max.
*  He Vogue just did this.
*  And now they're doing MMA math because Ilya did that to Vogue.
*  And even with Ilya doing MMA math, I beat a guy that beat you to my brother.
*  This is not how it works.
*  I lost to Dustin.
*  Dustin just got knocked up from from Justin.
*  And now what? Now, can I say I beat Dustin now?
*  No, it doesn't work that way.
*  Yeah. You know, styles make fights.
*  It's also like what happens in camp.
*  What what kind of condition are you coming into the fight in?
*  Are you fighting injured?
*  How did you just fight Islam Makachev and get head kick?
*  I mean, that's a big factor.
*  Brother, that was crazy.
*  You know, a lot of people is giving me a shit when
*  because they don't talk about our fight about me and Justin saying it was useless.
*  Fire whatever. And I'm like, bro, like if you took the fight in February
*  when like you should have, because you came out clean.
*  I think so Justin would have would have fought you, you know, but like,
*  how the hell is someone that you just knocked like that was a scary knockout.
*  Brother, like that was a scary knockout ass knockout.
*  And that guy turned around and come on my like, well, you know,
*  you're supposed to get hit for that long. Right.
*  And then now you're doing a camp.
*  Even if you're OK, say you do a camp, you don't spar camp. Right.
*  But then you sit training hard or whatever.
*  And like maybe you just accidentally fall over, bump your head on something,
*  you know, or like you're scratching your head, you know, or you're screaming
*  or something because you're stressing out.
*  You know, I'm like, I don't know what could happen.
*  But when you have to have a long time.
*  Yeah, I mean, look at look at Justin.
*  I just saw Justin finally doing interviews of this fight, and he just said,
*  like, I'm not doing nothing for six months.
*  Mm hmm. Like nothing.
*  And I'm like, bro, that's smart.
*  You know, when Marquez knocked out Manny Pacquiao,
*  Freddie Roach made him wait a year, one year, one year.
*  That's crazy. So you got to really heal up.
*  That was a bad knockout, bro.
*  You only got I remember it was it was you that talked about it,
*  like that talked about our brain.
*  This is like long time ago when you're talking about the cotton candy thing
*  and your brain and how it's how once that disappear,
*  you don't that shit don't grow back. Right. Exactly.
*  And I remember watching that was a long time.
*  I didn't know how many years that was that was ago.
*  And that really meant a lot.
*  And everybody keep telling me, like, oh, you get hit so much and blah, blah, blah.
*  This and that. I'm like, yeah, OK. In the fight, you might see me get hit.
*  But I'm not I'm not I'm not sparring, you know, like I'm not sparring.
*  I'm being smart. This Justin Gagey one brother, I was going to the gates of hell.
*  We had to bring back sparring.
*  Yeah, I mean, I was I was ready to be a crash dummy against the we.
*  I told Michael, just look, this is a man that is very dangerous.
*  We need to get in.
*  We need to get it in the thick of it and get it done.
*  So we bring back sparring for this one.
*  But it's still it wasn't very wise.
*  It's still wasn't crazy.
*  You know, it wasn't like we had a hard days out far outside of camp,
*  like outside of camp, and it was fun.
*  And then we kind of toned it out.
*  But getting ready for Justin Gagey had to.
*  But then with your brain, how you need to protect your brain.
*  You know, I mean, like there's so much movies like on concussions
*  and the movie concussion.
*  And we have so much.
*  What is it information now about the brain and how you can help yourself
*  and how you can mentally and physically help yourself get better
*  and help the brain out.
*  So why why not use that?
*  You know, a lot of people call me crazy.
*  A lot of people I keep hearing the talk about his chin.
*  Got to go this time. His chin.
*  Like, when the hell is my chin?
*  My chin was supposed to go to last 20 fights.
*  I mean, like, what are you guys talking about?
*  You know, yeah, it's ridiculous.
*  Someone either has a good chin or they don't have a good chin.
*  But you're not getting hit clean a lot.
*  One of the things that you do a lot is you you roll with shots.
*  You're very good at rolling with shots when you're getting hit.
*  You're getting hit. And I see you turn your face.
*  I see you taking some steam off of a lot of shots.
*  And your style is so it's it's it's a fun style to watch.
*  But it's also a nightmare to deal with.
*  You're switching stances.
*  You're you're you're constantly cutting angles.
*  Like the volume that you put on Justin, like when Justin was having
*  a hard time catching to you, it was it was very evident early on that you were on it.
*  But it was one of those fights where it's like, damn, Justin, with one punch
*  can fuck people up.
*  And it's just like avoiding that one punch.
*  And then we start tuning him up.
*  Then he dropped you. He dropped.
*  Oh, yeah. What was that?
*  So is it third third or fourth round?
*  I forget. Yeah, it didn't come out of the job, which is crazy.
*  And I mean, like a lot of people, it didn't count.
*  No, it didn't. So like they're there.
*  ESPN is like
*  posting and saying, like in however many fights and with the USC, right,
*  I stayed in here dropped.
*  And that's that's some bullshit.
*  You know, I mean, you get
*  get Justin down.
*  I'll take it.
*  You know what I mean? But I'm not I'll be a man to sit here.
*  I wouldn't be a man sitting here and telling you that it did, bro.
*  He brought all I remember getting hit by that punch.
*  And then like I sat and then I came back up.
*  I was like, what the fuck did he say?
*  Give me a holy shit.
*  I was like, that was a good punch.
*  And when I rewatched it, he hit me like right on the top of my my my dome.
*  I was like, holy smack, brother.
*  This guy, this guy smacks.
*  And then I was fine as soon as I got it was one of those like, boom,
*  you know, like the ladies give out the ladies give out like I was there.
*  Even when I was standing, I was looking at him.
*  But that I don't know how that didn't come to the drop.
*  But I don't know what they count as a drop because that has to count.
*  Because I yeah, yeah, that was that was crazy.
*  No, that's 100 percent a knockdown.
*  Somebody just made a mistake.
*  But like, did you ever see Ilya Toporia when he fought Jai Herbert?
*  Yeah, yeah, I saw that.
*  I saw that. I was funny.
*  I never saw the fight.
*  But then when people was when he was talking about fighting and we was fighting
*  and saying and he was he said something about dropping me or killing me.
*  And then I see the comments of him getting that that hit that left
*  head kick getting dropped.
*  So I was like, oh, yeah, I didn't see the fight, but I saw that part.
*  I've been it was an amazing comeback because he knocked him out in the second round.
*  But man, he could take a shot because he got hit so clean
*  with a switch kick off the left side, right chin to the chin.
*  Just perfect.
*  I mean, it was just whack.
*  And then his whole body just goes out and then he grabbed a hold of a single.
*  Check this out. Watch this.
*  Boom. I mean, dude, watch the head snap back.
*  Look at the head snap back.
*  I mean, that is just shin to the chin.
*  Yeah, that is just a perfect Jai Herbert head kick.
*  But he grabbed a hold of him and he managed to maintain his composure,
*  got him to the ground, survives the round and actually was winning
*  the rest of the round.
*  Look, four minutes.
*  He did a lot of wrestling, did a lot of wrestling.
*  He's a very complete fighter.
*  Yeah, very good. He's very good.
*  Very good. And his fucking boxing man, his boxing is terrifying.
*  I was I was shocked that Volk wanted to take that fight
*  so quickly after the market fight.
*  And if I was his friend, I would have not recommended that.
*  But I don't know if you could talk to him.
*  I mean, he's a champion.
*  You know, yeah, there's dudes like that is like Mike.
*  We can do it, Mike.
*  We're going to go to war.
*  He's looking at him.
*  He's an animal. He's an animal.
*  But the human body, it's a the vulnerabilities of the human body are real.
*  Despite the spirit of the man. Yeah.
*  Despite the spirit of the man.
*  You got damage.
*  No matter your spirit, you still have something.
*  Your brain, your muscles are still hurting.
*  So it's going to only protect itself when you feel something.
*  When there is a warning sign going off, like, oh, man, warning, did it shut off?
*  Because it's like, look, I'm going to save me from myself.
*  Like that's what Connor fought Dustin the last time.
*  He had a broken shin.
*  Yeah, he is. His leg was broken.
*  Or he was a stress factor.
*  Right. Yeah. He had a fracture going into that fight.
*  And he knew it.
*  And the body is going to your body is going to give up, you know, no matter how strong the will is.
*  Think about like what that cost him a lot.
*  Two years, two years, two years.
*  And who knows where he could have been if he hadn't taken that fight and he'd let look, it's only eight weeks.
*  Yeah. That you got a stress fracture like that.
*  It's like eight weeks and it's healed.
*  Right. Because it's not all the way through.
*  That's crazy. It could have healed it.
*  And then, you know, and you assume they didn't move mountains for that man.
*  So why not? I don't know if they knew it was a fracture, though it definitely was.
*  But they I think they had done MRIs on it.
*  It was inconclusive.
*  Turned out, oh, but it was badly hurt.
*  Yeah. You know, you've had bone bruises.
*  Yeah. You're like, I don't know if this is broken.
*  You got to get it looked at. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They suck.
*  No, they heard, bro.
*  They heard. How was your left shin?
*  Brother, my left shin, it's all right now, but they heard, bro.
*  I was about to talk about it, bro.
*  This guy kick hard as shit. Yeah.
*  And his bow, the way his bones, I don't know what it was made out of, bro.
*  I think it's a titanium.
*  Like, I like to say my chin is made out of vibranium, brother.
*  He had a vibranium leg, bro.
*  I was like, he went to Wakanda too.
*  I was thinking to myself, like, how?
*  I thought I don't even got to go to Wakanda.
*  I guess he went too, you know?
*  But then I did, but it hurt.
*  Like I said, my shin is bruised.
*  It feels good. I can move it, whatever.
*  It was like stiff after the fight.
*  In there, a lot of people always, I always hear you talk about it in there
*  and be like, oh, yeah, it hurts.
*  I don't really feel it.
*  Like, I don't pay too much mind to it in the fight.
*  I can feel when he hits it and it's like, oh, I'm telling myself
*  that's going to hurt later.
*  But you got 25 minutes, you know, we got to stay in here, you know?
*  And that's what's interesting is it doesn't seem to compromise
*  your movement that much.
*  It depends entirely upon the person.
*  Like some people get calf kicked once real hard and it swells up
*  and you see immediately they're walking fucked up
*  and they're trying to switch south spa.
*  Yeah, they're trying to switch stances.
*  Yeah.
*  But you don't seem to have as much of a problem with it.
*  Yeah, it wasn't really a problem.
*  I know it hurts.
*  I know it's going to be hurt after the fight.
*  But then even that, like switching stances, the most craziest thing to me
*  while after getting like completely landed nicely there.
*  Because if I switch stances, he screwed up two of my legs.
*  What I'm going to do, crawl over to him.
*  Right. You know what I mean?
*  I'd rather have one leg than two legs messed up.
*  You know, so.
*  And then I think that's you.
*  I think you're particularly durable because some guys like you've seen
*  what happens with Paheta.
*  He kicks you a couple of times in that leg and that leg's fucked up, man.
*  Messed up everybody.
*  Even Jan Bojovic, who's made out of rocks.
*  Yeah.
*  Jan's like his bones are made out of stone.
*  Remember when he was going with Uncle I have he went shin to shin with him?
*  Yeah. He was just cracking shins of them and fucking his leg up.
*  Yeah. And then a guy like, bro, did you see the picture of me and Alex?
*  Alex, did you guys see the picture of me and Alex?
*  They face swapped them.
*  They put my face on Alex Ferraro.
*  Try to look it up, brother.
*  He looks like Thanos, bro.
*  And Money Moekano, bro. Money Moekano is like, yeah, fuck this guy.
*  You know, you know, Money Moekano is like, yeah, fuck that guy, bro.
*  You got to kill that.
*  Money Moekano is the funniest guy.
*  I love that guy.
*  Brother, he was like, I saw on Twitter, he was like, yeah, people asking me
*  to fight Max because he's nine and I'm ten or something or eight and nine or something like that.
*  Are you fucking crazy?
*  He's like, I'll fight him if we have one rule, no punching.
*  I love Money Moekano, bro.
*  He's a funny dude. Man, he almost lost that Jalen Turner fight.
*  That was crazy. What happened there?
*  Jalen Turner tried to look cool and get a walk off KO and it didn't happen.
*  It didn't happen. You can't do that.
*  You got to follow up. That was the fight.
*  Like if he beat Moekano, man, and Jalen had him.
*  We had him.
*  We were in. I was at the hotel room, still watching that fight.
*  I was watching it.
*  We were watching it. And yeah, I was tripping out.
*  And you know, it's funny.
*  As soon as that as soon as that happened, I was like, I told my coach, I was like,
*  you know, it'd be funny if Money Moekano comes out and re-nickers him the next round.
*  And he finishes on the next round.
*  I was like, damn, I was like, well, it wasn't funny, but it was like, damn, that's amazing.
*  Well, Jalen is so long.
*  He's so dangerous to his knockout power, like at length.
*  It's he catches guys on the end of shots.
*  You can't even come close to him and he's cracking you.
*  And he's got nasty power.
*  And, you know, that Moekano dude, he he's tough.
*  He's very tough.
*  The fact that he figured it out is like, fuck all this standing.
*  I'm going to grab that dude and drag him to the ground.
*  Smart, bro. Smart. Yeah.
*  Yeah. IQ. That's that's fight IQ, bro.
*  And a card that was. Oh, brother.
*  And the from the first time I had I had a family and friends that came to the fight
*  and they went to the first fight at Cody Garbrand.
*  You had to figure it out. You had to, bro.
*  You had to. And you got two former world champions going at it in the first fight.
*  Yeah, that's insane.
*  And two guys that are still awesome.
*  And it was and it was fighting.
*  It was a fight. It was a fight.
*  Yeah. How crazy was it when he went for the handstand kick?
*  Imagine he landed that kick on stuff's face when he went for the handstand
*  and then he just went for a regular leg kick.
*  Yeah. I almost kicked him in the head.
*  That was crazy.
*  Yeah, those cartwheel kicks are ridiculous.
*  Crazy, crazy. You got to set them up, brother.
*  You can't be just trying to turn them freely like that, you know?
*  Well, Justin tried rolling thunder on you in the last round, right?
*  I knew I knew he was going to try it.
*  I knew that that's what Justin's known for.
*  You know, so I knew he's going to do it.
*  We knew he's going to do a couple of stuff.
*  We knew power punches, leg kicks.
*  I was thinking if we got later in the rounds or if he was getting comfortable,
*  he's going to try and do that.
*  The rolling thunder kick.
*  So who's ready for it?
*  You know, he's got this weird ability to kick your legs like in a close,
*  bro, close. Yeah, I heard you talking about how his hip is so flexible
*  that he can just kick.
*  He can. It was almost like, you know, you might what it remind me.
*  It wasn't a high kick, of course.
*  But you know what his leg kick remind me of?
*  It reminds me of your year's high kick.
*  Like me and your year could be nose to nose and a fucking kick comes up.
*  I'm like, holy shit.
*  Like he did it to me one time. Yeah.
*  And I was like, what?
*  Like, why are you guys so flexible?
*  And even like with with Justin, with his leg kick, bro,
*  like some of them is even his angles that he take on his kick.
*  I'm like, you're not hitting me with this.
*  And if I can, it cracks me, this whole shin across my knee.
*  I'm like, what is going on? How are you landing this?
*  It's like his angles is weird, bro.
*  He has some weird angles for it, for sure.
*  Well, he's very unique in a lot of ways.
*  Is a very unique style, very unique mentality.
*  He's a unique guy.
*  But the leg kicks in the clinch when he was was it was it still PFL back then?
*  Was PFL. I know what you're talking about.
*  The one that he was in the clinch and he was in the clinch.
*  Just kicking and full power leg kicks.
*  He TKO'd that guy.
*  It's horrible to watch because you're dealing with the clinch
*  and you're thinking, oh, we're just clinching here.
*  And he's just killing your legs like no one can.
*  I don't know anybody else who kicks the legs from the clinch like Justin Gaethje does.
*  Full power clinch.
*  You know how you do that heel kick?
*  That's what people do.
*  They usually grab that heel and they hit it or whatever.
*  But like this guy is like straight Jose Aldo running leg kicking to you in the clinch.
*  You know, it's insane.
*  Think about all the guys you fought, Max.
*  I mean, you have fought the best of the best.
*  You fought everybody except Makhachev.
*  There's like everybody of your era you fought.
*  Yeah. Well, the Makhachev fight is not not too far off.
*  So, you know, never say never.
*  I got a couple more years in me for sure.
*  What do you think if you had to plan it out?
*  OK, so here we got Poirier and Makhachev are fighting.
*  They're fighting next.
*  And that's going to be what is that? New Jersey, New Jersey, New Jersey.
*  So let's say Makhachev wins.
*  If Makhachev wins, well, even if Poirier wins, if Poirier wins,
*  if Poirier wins, that'd be a fun fight.
*  It's a great rematch.
*  We have history, you know, especially at 55.
*  We have 45.
*  And make it a double belt.
*  Brother, I would love that, brother.
*  The double belt.
*  That would be crazy.
*  The double belt.
*  First time ever.
*  Every great.
*  BMF and the lightweight title on the line.
*  That'd be crazy.
*  Wow, that would be wild.
*  But even if whoever wins.
*  But then I really like.
*  No, here's the thing.
*  At 55, you look fantastic.
*  You look bigger. You look stronger.
*  I'm sure it felt better.
*  Like, oh, yeah, good.
*  But I got the cut, bro.
*  The cut was the cut was a cut.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  But it was it was beautiful, brother.
*  I was eating sushi all week, eating more.
*  I eat sushi when I go to 45, too.
*  But I was eating more sushi all week.
*  Well, I was loving it.
*  Do you think that that's better for you?
*  We see what happens.
*  You know, I feel like I still have unfinished business.
*  But I want to get that.
*  I mean, before this fight, before this fight, you know,
*  we only had like a couple of options after this fight.
*  We the whole main goal with this fight was like, just have all the options.
*  That was the main that was going down.
*  And you achieve that goal.
*  That was my main going to this fight was the mentality was let's have all the options.
*  We put we go out there.
*  We do something spectacular.
*  You know, I'm right up there with the top 50 fibers.
*  I'm right up.
*  I still have my my spot with the 45ers.
*  And then, you know, to my surprise, after the fight,
*  they announced a Connor, a Connor versus Chandler fight.
*  So it's like me and Connor have some history.
*  So there's options, you know what I mean?
*  And they're talking about doing something at 65.
*  I know DC's been saying this.
*  I don't know what he knows. I haven't pressed him.
*  I'm sure DC knows something.
*  I got only talks about stuff when he knows he's. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. He tries to.
*  This is what DC acts about that.
*  You know, DC, you've been you call a lot of fights with him.
*  You know him as a person.
*  He don't talk about nothing unless he knows something is going on, brother.
*  It's either. That's what I'm thinking.
*  Yeah, it's either he knows something going on or he's just bullshitting.
*  So it's either they say it's one or the other.
*  Yeah. He never ever plays the middle.
*  Exactly. With that, with that, you know what I mean?
*  I know he doesn't push it, but I know he sees other stuff.
*  It's like it's crazy.
*  Like because I saw him talking about the BNF.
*  Did you see that one with that bit with R.C.
*  when he told R.C. that he should who should also fight for the BNF.
*  And I know disrespect to him, but like, come on, DC, what the hell?
*  He's like he's just so off offline on that side.
*  You know, I say, yeah, he's so out of pocket.
*  Like calling that, you know, well, he's out of pocket
*  because he's so biased towards wrestling.
*  Yeah, he wants he's like, there's been no takedowns in the BNF fights.
*  Like I think that's what a BNF belt is, you know?
*  Well, they can be takedowns if it happens.
*  But, you know, just have it just because you want takedowns.
*  Bring a wrestler in. Yeah.
*  But that belt is a special belt.
*  You know, it's it's it's a wild belt.
*  It's like it's wild.
*  These are wild fights.
*  You know, you know, it's funny, like a lot of them.
*  It's funny because I see a lot of these guys, these MMA guys, guys,
*  some guys who's just like even doing MMA.
*  I see everything, brother, from like low level MMA guys
*  that's trying to come up to mid to high.
*  And and before this fight,
*  everybody was shedding on the BNF or whatever, blah, blah, blah.
*  And then now that I got it, I'm happy to see that it's actually getting its worth.
*  You know what I mean? At the end of the day, everybody's saying, oh, no, undisputed.
*  Well, I was undisputed champion.
*  I have the BNF belt now. What is it?
*  You know, you cannot tell.
*  Well, I'm fighting number one contenders and keep fighting these number
*  and champions. What now?
*  You tell me what it is.
*  You know, I didn't.
*  The belt is cool.
*  And I always tell everybody the boat is cool.
*  But you guys got to understand it's what brings with the belt,
*  what what the emotions it brings and what kind of fight it brings to a card.
*  You know, like that our fight, a lot of people were saying
*  could have been the main event of 300.
*  So it's insane.
*  You know, 100 percent.
*  And the crazy thing is there was two insane fights after your fight.
*  Your fight was so good that two insane world title fights
*  after and it happened after.
*  And still people talk about your fight.
*  And I felt so bad for the girls because I was watching that fight in the back
*  after doing my media.
*  And it was such a crazy fight, brother.
*  Amazing. But but but I think so people was just they just had a adrenaline
*  dump because of what happened in the last fight.
*  You know, I lost my voice, bro.
*  I lost my voice. I really did.
*  I've never lost my voice ever.
*  Yeah. UFC fight.
*  But when you dropped him, I was the first time I ever stood up.
*  I couldn't sit down.
*  I was standing up. I was just like, I saw that.
*  I saw you stand up. That's the first time I saw you.
*  It was just what Dana had the greatest quote in the post fight press conference.
*  He said, I sell holy shit moments when people ask me, what do I do for a living?
*  Look at this. I couldn't even sit down.
*  I had to get up.
*  I had to hold on to those guys. I'm holding on to them.
*  That's awesome.
*  It's funny when they started putting cameras on us
*  because we've been doing that forever.
*  DC and I go crazy. We hug each other. We go nuts.
*  Yeah. When something crazy happens like what?
*  What? I'm glad. I'm glad they did.
*  Because to see to see like see fans and and reactions to the fight is cool.
*  But they're fans.
*  But then when you see like our peers and guys like you and my and other fighters
*  and commentators of the sport that you've been around forever.
*  So to see you do that, that would like that brings a humongous smile to my face.
*  Like, holy shit, I just made Joe Rogan stand out.
*  You know, I say to this day and I do it based on my reaction.
*  Obviously, this is personal.
*  I say it's the greatest knockout of all time.
*  The reason why I say it's the greatest knockout of all time is because
*  everybody thought that Justin was going to be overpowering you.
*  He was a bigger guy.
*  He had just knocked out Dustin Poirier.
*  You had lost the last fight to Volkanovsky.
*  You hadn't been entitled contention since then.
*  You had a bunch of great wins.
*  But here you're going to fight this bigger guy.
*  And all these people were writing you off.
*  All these people were saying that it did.
*  And you're tuning him up.
*  And you did have to overcome getting knocked down.
*  And you did have adversity.
*  You had deal with that.
*  And then for you to stand winning four rounds to one in the middle of the octagon
*  and point the ground with 10 seconds left and then to knock him out with one second
*  left, the way I reacted, the way I jumped up, I've never done that before.
*  Even when Leon Edwards knocked out Usman, that was another crazy one.
*  Yeah, that was for that.
*  I would say that was the greatest knockout of all time because he was down.
*  He was down four rounds.
*  And John Anik just had the perfect call.
*  He said that is not the cloth from which he is cut.
*  We're talking about it.
*  Yeah, it was a movie.
*  Yeah.
*  So that was number one before.
*  But you are number one now.
*  Thank you, brother.
*  That's number one.
*  Because just impact all time, like complete polar shift of how people think about the
*  BMF belt. They don't think about it as a gimmick at all.
*  Because it was the wildest, crazy fight with an undeniable number one contender in Justin
*  versus you.
*  It's wild how it happened.
*  Yeah, the whole thing was wild.
*  I mean, you only as good as your last fight, right?
*  That's that's that's what it is.
*  This sport.
*  I like to tell everybody, you know, this is not like basketball.
*  This is not this is not like baseball or like hockey where you can just shit the bed
*  on a Tuesday and then you come back out on a Friday and then you you're just a man of
*  the world again. You know, like you shit like like this stuff happen.
*  You have a bad fight like with Alex.
*  That fight don't get erased off until I have something great.
*  And even if you have a good fight, you know what I mean?
*  Like I had a good fight with Arnold, but they still like Alex.
*  He did that.
*  And then I did it with Koreans on and then I had a knockout over Korean zombie.
*  And then they're like, yeah, but Korean is old and blah, blah, blah.
*  And then finally now with this judge, now everybody forgets, you know, like it takes
*  us a while to forget about your last fight.
*  You know, so it was just it was amazing, bro.
*  You know, like to see everybody go crazy, like in my mind, like a lot of people ask
*  me, what's going through your mind when you're doing that?
*  You're up for one.
*  I'm like, brother, that was that was in my mind the whole time.
*  I'm like, we want to 10 seconds.
*  I was like, I remember counting.
*  I remember it being a minute.
*  I remember my coach yelling a minute, Max, stay clean.
*  And then I was like, oh, hell yeah.
*  Fifteen more seconds until we go to the center.
*  We're going to swing in my mind.
*  And then he's like 40 seconds.
*  I was like, holy shit, this clock is slow.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I'm like, why is it taking forever?
*  And then he's like, 30 seconds.
*  And then he's like, OK, 20 seconds.
*  And then he does.
*  And he goes he got right after the 20 seconds mark underneath a couple of seconds
*  after he does his rolling thunder.
*  And then it pushed me to a point of perfectly circle out.
*  And then that's when I said I did the like, oh, come here.
*  You know, let's let's go here.
*  Let's do it because that was just everybody's losing their mind.
*  But to me, I just this is normal.
*  You know, this is the second time.
*  This is the second time I did it.
*  You know, of course, the second time I'm doing it, I heard you guys say,
*  the first time was Ricardo, but this ain't no Justin
*  Justin Gagey, you know, but you know, why not?
*  Why not? If he if he was to put if he was to put me out, then
*  then so be it, you know, live by the sword.
*  Well, it was a wild and there's a rolling thunder.
*  Damn, that was a nice rolling thunder.
*  That was nice. It was close.
*  Now, right here.
*  Oh, this is so crazy, Max.
*  Oh, that was crazy.
*  It's the greatest.
*  It has to be the greatest knockout. It has to be.
*  And then you and you flex and walking around.
*  Come on, man.
*  That's the greatest.
*  They got the sickest picture of me, bro.
*  They had the sickest picture of me when I'm flexing and I'm over.
*  I like I love Justin, bro.
*  I freaking love the man.
*  But they have like the you know, like the Muhammad, the Muhammad Ali picture.
*  Yeah. Yeah. They got a moment of me like that.
*  So I got a painting for you.
*  I told you I got a Ross Baines.
*  He's an amazing artist.
*  He made an incredible painting.
*  And it's it's on the way.
*  I had someone go back to my house. Go grab it.
*  Sick. It's on the way.
*  But yeah, that was a there's a wild moment, man.
*  It's just complete shift of what people care about in upcoming fights.
*  Like you are the fucking man now.
*  Like whatever the next pay per view you're in.
*  Holy shit, that's going to be big.
*  And if it's you and Markachov or if it's you and Ilja, you and Ilja would be crazy.
*  Brother, brother, so much.
*  So much fun, brother. I know.
*  Is that Spain? Is that 305?
*  When is there going to be a UFC?
*  Perth is 305, right?
*  I don't think they're going to go Spain this year.
*  I don't think they can.
*  I think so. Dana White said it said in the in the 300 conference.
*  After Fight Conference, he said that
*  we're going with Spain.
*  It just takes a time because you got to book something and it's like going to be like a year and out.
*  So that fight should be Vegas.
*  Yeah. Let's go.
*  Yeah, I hope I hope Vegas or Madison Square Garden.
*  Yeah. Or or or Vegas Legion Stadium.
*  Oh, sixty six thousand, brother.
*  That's what it is.
*  Did you use their 300 night?
*  Did you not see all the Hawaiian flags?
*  They were everywhere.
*  Bro, that's the ninth island.
*  Give me you cannot.
*  We can't go to UFC Hawaii.
*  Give me Legion Stadium and that's that's that's good.
*  Go crazy.
*  Oh, my God. You could sell it.
*  Allegiant Stadium for a big UFC, 100 percent.
*  They can sell it. I mean, every UFC sells out like that.
*  They sell out so quick.
*  So many scalp tickets and a fight like that, especially if they put together a banger of a card.
*  Because, you know, they're doing the sphere, which is going to be wild.
*  Yeah, that's going to be what we think.
*  Who do you think will be in the sphere?
*  That's a good question. Right.
*  Because that's isn't it.
*  It's Mexican Independence Day.
*  Yes, it's September.
*  Yeah. Well, I don't think they have it set up like who Mexicans like to call me as their own.
*  So I might even be in the sphere. Who knows?
*  They count you. Yeah.
*  For your style. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Fuck. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Fuck. What a crazy night, Max.
*  What a crazy night.
*  And to have that happen again, like where there's two amazing fights after yours.
*  Oh, yeah. And everybody's still just talking about your fight.
*  Yeah, I know. I was I mean, even with the.
*  I remember as soon as the fight happened, you know, a couple of minutes after
*  my my agent, Tim Simpson, came in and he told me, hey, he's like, brother,
*  they just put your knockout on top of on top of Instagram on and YouTube and everything.
*  I was like, what? They never do that.
*  Yeah, they're like, they never do that. They only did this for they only did it for sugar.
*  And I was like, what? This is crazy.
*  So we saw I thought it was lying, you know, and they saw it was there.
*  Three different angles. And I reposted it.
*  Yeah. I was like, if UFC's posting this, I'm posting this shit too.
*  Like, this is the craziest knockout of all time.
*  But the craziest angle is the one when they they they they pause me and then they do
*  a 360 view and then they play it again.
*  I'm like, that's that's insane, bro.
*  Yeah. What does it feel like when it's all over?
*  Does it feel like a dream? What does it feel like when it's over?
*  Well, I said I, you know, like I said, I'm still getting used to it.
*  I don't even know. You know, I feel normal.
*  I said life stood normal.
*  But like I'm getting brother walking down Sixth Street last night to get my dinner.
*  I was getting harassed.
*  Like not harassed, like nicely harassed.
*  But like people like, yeah, like you're getting I always get noticed.
*  But like these guys, like it's it's out and about way more, you know.
*  And so it's just amazing.
*  Even like guys who don't even look like they watch fighting, you know, grandmas
*  and grandpas at airports, like, hey, you're the guy.
*  Yeah, I'm the guy.
*  Well, that clip got so viral, too.
*  You know, that clip was so viral.
*  It was everywhere. It was tick tock and YouTube was.
*  Bro, we might.
*  So one of my other agent on our team, Daniel, he did like he's like a numbers guy or whatever.
*  And the Google the Google search on me was like crazy, bro.
*  I think so. I think so is in like the billions.
*  Like after after it was insane, it was something stupid.
*  I was like, oh, wow, I didn't even know you could look that up.
*  I told him. Yeah, that's what makes it very interesting for your next fight.
*  Because your next fight is going to be huge.
*  It's going to be huge. Like you're a fucking bonafide superstar now.
*  Like your next fight is going to be nuts.
*  Can't wait, bro. Can't wait.
*  I don't know who it is, who it was, what what the UFC want to do.
*  But like you said, that option brought in this game, you all have the options.
*  And there's so many options in your area, too. Right.
*  Like Sugar has been talking about fighting to Poria at forty five.
*  Well, if sugar's willing to fight to Poria forty five, he's willing to fight Max at forty five.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  There's crazy matchups all over the place.
*  In a perfect world, you actually in a perfect world.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. In a perfect world.
*  If I could have in my way, I'd be stupid to not say to fight Connor.
*  You know, I think that that kind of fight would be huge, whatever.
*  But we don't know what he's going to do.
*  So if that's out in a perfect world to me, it would be fight Elia forty five title.
*  Get my hand raised.
*  And whoever's the next guy up at fifty five, fight them.
*  Triangle for double champ status, whatever it is.
*  Oh, even trip out, you know, like forty five, the BMS and put it put the BMS
*  in the fifty five against whoever at fifty five and that'd be that'd be surreal.
*  You know, I think that would be a crazy.
*  Well, there's another option, too, if they really do this Connor one sixty five title.
*  There's an option of you being a three champ.
*  That'd be insane if they did the one sixty five.
*  It'd be fun. That'd be fun.
*  You'd have to cut anyway. Oh, no.
*  Eat sushi every day.
*  I'd eat sushi. I'd eat sushi.
*  I'd eat on the scale.
*  What is what is your walk around weight like what's right now?
*  Me right now, I walk around like
*  before I used to get to a big boy, but now I walk around like seventy seventy five.
*  Nothing crazy. Oh, that's not too crazy.
*  Yeah, nothing crazy. Nothing crazy.
*  I was in there against they make us check our weight now.
*  And I was only one seventy two when we when we in and against Gagey.
*  When you were fighting a featherweight, what did you weigh in when you fought?
*  I'd be around like sixty five.
*  I'd get a high 60s, maybe sixty eight at the highest.
*  So did you I know you did a lot of strength and conditioning.
*  Your YouTube channel is great, by the way.
*  Oh, thank you. And it's really cool how you document pretty much everything.
*  You're showing all your training, all this stuff.
*  So you did a lot of strength and conditioning.
*  We did a lot of straight. We did a lot of strength.
*  So a lot of people is talking about matching Gagey strength.
*  And and and I our team didn't want to.
*  We wanted to be strong, but we still wanted to be fast.
*  We knew we was faster than Gagey.
*  So our main focus, everybody thought it was strength and getting big
*  to be strong and to, of course, endure his strikes, you know.
*  But the main thing that we want to focus on was speed.
*  Like I knew I could I could outgun them.
*  And in the fit round, when we really heard him heard him, I outgun them with speed.
*  You know, I hit like I hit him with like five, five hits.
*  And and the one that you don't see hurt you the most, you know,
*  and the last right hand in that in that little combination early in the fit round
*  is what hurt him the most, you know, made him like I stunned him a little bit.
*  So we're just working on speed, brother.
*  You know, like we had 12 weeks.
*  You you really can't.
*  I wasn't willing to give to put strength to give up conditioning.
*  So I was like, I'm going to be speed and condition.
*  And that's the way I fight.
*  You know, I if you go look at it, a lot of people is looking at stats
*  for minds in his fight about like how much he's chosen strikes
*  and how much I throw in strikes, how much he gets hit,
*  which is less than how much I get hit.
*  And I was like, brother, that cannot be right.
*  And the stats is, you know, and I'm like, no way.
*  And when you look at the stats, this guy had 12 fights
*  and I had like 20 plus fights in the UFC.
*  That's what come our stats is so close to each other
*  because I have so much more fights than his.
*  And then even that what I had a lot of time in the octagon.
*  And he just did it because he would he would knock guys out.
*  You know what I mean? Yeah.
*  He had that beautiful power.
*  So, you know, at the end of the day, like, you know, the numbers,
*  some of the numbers that these guys are putting out there,
*  I was like, brother, you guys need to do your homework.
*  You know, you stop looking at the surface level, like start digging into it.
*  Yeah. When it was interesting
*  that what you just said about strength and conditioning,
*  you you're not willing to give up conditioning for strength.
*  So so how do you approach that?
*  Like when you when you made a decision to go to 55.
*  So the pori a fight, you go to 55, but you did it on pretty short notice.
*  Yeah. Yeah. We had we had like.
*  So the way we train is I always take two weeks off before fights.
*  So it was like six weeks.
*  And then so we actually had four weeks to train for them.
*  And I was like, I mean, put the picture of poor
*  of punching me in my face is a famous picture of poor, a puny man.
*  Face explain that when you said, do you take two weeks off before the fight?
*  What do you mean? So like like strength and conditioning.
*  So I don't do no strength and conditioning like the week before the fight.
*  Like maybe we do like a little lift or whatever, but it's just something
*  you maintain, like because you can't get faster or stronger
*  two weeks before fight or even the week. Right.
*  So even with cardio, it's not going to anything I do
*  the week before the fight is not going to help me.
*  And anything I do the week of the fight is not going to help me.
*  All the hard work is done. Right.
*  And that's what these guys look. Look, look how fat I was.
*  Look at that top right one, that top right one right there.
*  Look how fat I was. Yeah. Look at. Yeah.
*  That's muffin top Max, brother.
*  So you just he zooms in. Wow.
*  Wow. You're an asshole.
*  So you only had four weeks and there's no way you could put on
*  that amount of muscle in four weeks or anything.
*  You know, and I was like, and I didn't I didn't have my beautiful wife
*  at the time. So, you know, he meals was crazy before her.
*  I eat out every night.
*  I was terrible. And now she cooks me and I see keeps me clean.
*  So it is what it is.
*  You know, I hate using the excuse is because, you know, Dustin,
*  I came out there and fought hard and we fought hard.
*  And I ain't thinking nothing away from Dustin.
*  So whatever I did was on me.
*  And, you know, if that fight, if we get a third one, then
*  I think it'd be pretty fun.
*  Oh, it'd be amazing.
*  That would be a wild third fight between you guys.
*  Be wild, especially if he beats Islam, if he beats Islam.
*  That'd be crazy. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I want to know, Brian, how much is the how much is the odds on betting
*  on him dropping a ghillie?
*  He's going to try.
*  You know, I didn't know that he was referencing William Montgomery,
*  the comedian when I never going to stop over.
*  That's what he's doing.
*  He's doing William Montgomery from Kill Tony.
*  I didn't know. And I'm friends with William Montgomery.
*  I love that dude. And you're not a good friend.
*  And you know, what the hell?
*  You know, I felt like a bad friend.
*  But really what it is, is like when I'm doing an interview
*  after such a crazy fight like that, you
*  interviews are complicated.
*  You're locked in.
*  I'm trying to get this guy to express himself as much as possible.
*  I'm trying to stay out of the way.
*  But I'm also trying to ask questions.
*  And so I didn't pick up on it.
*  Yeah. Plus, I didn't.
*  I was like, no way.
*  Yeah, you're locked in, bro.
*  But Tony texted me, he goes, did he just quote William Montgomery?
*  I'm like, no way. Really?
*  Is that what that was?
*  And then and then Willie texted you, fuck you.
*  No, they had been going back and forth.
*  He apparently Dustin told me he was going to say it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. They've been DMing each other.
*  That's awesome. Yeah, it's hilarious.
*  Dustin's the man, bro. Yeah.
*  Now, he had been pressuring you.
*  There have been moments in the fight where you chose to jump to guard
*  and try to grab a guillotine.
*  Yeah, I'll do it. And I'll never stop doing it.
*  I'll never stop doing it.
*  Dustin's one of the good guys in our sport.
*  He's a great guy. He's a great guy.
*  I love Dustin. I love Dustin.
*  And I was glad for him to get that win over Benoit Sandini as a monster.
*  Monster, killer, bro. He's a killer, bro.
*  And that's another fight, right?
*  Look, Sandini gets staff. Yeah.
*  So he's got staff on his forehead.
*  He's got to take antibiotics, drain.
*  Have you ever had staff?
*  No, bro. Not going to.
*  That's amazing. Yeah.
*  How have you avoided staff?
*  Yeah, brother. I'm clean, I guess.
*  I guess. I guess.
*  You're doing something, right?
*  Some guys are some dirty mother-f**ers, I think, you know?
*  Well, you get staff easy. You get staff easy.
*  No, I know. I know. Some guys, some...
*  I mean, once it's in your system, you just...
*  It just got to get reawakened, right?
*  So one of our friends, like he's pretty bad with it.
*  Like he's always got staff like every other week, feels like.
*  Oh, really? Yeah, it's terrible.
*  He is terrible. Does he take showers?
*  Brother, he does. He does everything.
*  I don't know what it is. It's just bad luck, I think.
*  Another thing is like people mistakenly use antibacterial soap.
*  Like you don't want antibacterial soap.
*  You want to keep your healthy gut floor.
*  I tell everybody, I don't...
*  I know the guy who owns the company.
*  I have no affiliation with it, but defense soap.
*  If you're a grappler, it's the shit.
*  Defense soap is all natural.
*  It's like tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, and he has all kinds of products,
*  everything from stuff to clean, like wipes.
*  If you can't like get to a shower quick enough,
*  if you know, if you're training in a place that's kind of dingy
*  and doesn't have a shower, they have wipes until you get home.
*  They have soaps and ointments.
*  That's the most crazy thing, bro, right?
*  When people like I see people like we train
*  and then we have a shower at the gym and some of them just like change their clothes
*  and like, I got to go. It's like.
*  What the hell? Did you shower?
*  I said, no, no, I got to leave.
*  I was like, the hell? No way.
*  You know, like I live like 45 minutes.
*  Some of them live like maybe 15 minutes.
*  15 minutes is enough for a ringworm or something to if I can wake up, you know?
*  So it's like, brother, just jump in there, get a rinse off.
*  Yeah, I've had ringworm. I've had staff twice.
*  I've had ringworm a couple of times.
*  It's annoying. It's annoying.
*  I ringworm irritating.
*  The defense soap is the shit.
*  I tell everybody, get on that to me.
*  And it doesn't mess up because it's all natural.
*  It's like tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil and smells good.
*  But it doesn't fuck up your skin for I had it.
*  I knew this dude who had ringworm.
*  And so he started using antibacterial soap and he got it everywhere.
*  Yeah. Oh, it's spread over his chest.
*  And then what it does to it burns your skin.
*  Yeah. So like so like when you use that kind of stuff with ringworm,
*  I remember people used to like bleach them and then you'd be bleached.
*  You'd have a bleached circle.
*  Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Yeah. Psycho dudes use bleach.
*  That's a crazy move.
*  Poor bleach on an open wound.
*  Like, what the fuck are you?
*  What are you doing, man?
*  So so for this fight, how much notice did you have
*  that you were going to fight at 55 and that you're going to fight Justin?
*  Brother, so there is an idea of maybe a maybe it is going to happen for a while.
*  But we didn't know. And then we got we got confirmed.
*  I think was like 10 to 12 weeks.
*  You know, like, I don't know what it was.
*  So it's like 10 to 12 weeks.
*  So it was like more than enough time.
*  This is like we had so much time, but it was planning.
*  I got the train. I got the lift.
*  I was already we were training a lot.
*  My last fight was in August.
*  So I was in I was in the gym training, getting ready.
*  Brother, after the vote after the vote and.
*  Is them to fight?
*  I was like, there is no way they're letting this guy turn around.
*  So I really thought they was going to try and ask me
*  me to go fight Ilya in January or something.
*  I went to Toronto.
*  I fought in Toronto twice.
*  I want to intro. I defended the belt there.
*  I have a following in Toronto.
*  I call it a tent island.
*  You know, I like to call it.
*  I love the Canadians, but they're literally the best.
*  So I was thinking like, man, they would they were going to get caught.
*  You know, like there's there's no way that he's going to fight.
*  And then. He did.
*  If they just moved it from January to February, they put the other card, whatever.
*  They switch it around.
*  So we was I was already training and then.
*  Yeah, I couldn't tell you when, but I knew we had at least 12 weeks,
*  at least 12 weeks.
*  When did you know that it was going to be 55?
*  And when did you know it was going to be for the BMF belt?
*  That was 12 weeks.
*  So had you already had a plan to put weight on?
*  Do you already have a plan like strength and conditioning plan?
*  And for sure, as soon as we as soon as the talks of maybe
*  we might even fight Gichi at all was like we just got it.
*  Our plan was what I said was like, we got to put on size to endure damage.
*  But then let's not lose this speed.
*  That's my my my my my head coach, Darren Yap, a tactical straight,
*  the best training conditioning in all of Hawaii.
*  And if somebody got a problem, then they can they can meet me somewhere anywhere.
*  You know, but but you know, all jokes aside, he's the he's the man, bro.
*  And he's the one that was like, yeah, you know, like, I like, look,
*  I know you want to get strong.
*  I see the one that came up with it.
*  He's like, I know you want to get stronger, but we still need you speed, bro.
*  We still need your speed.
*  And we got to outwork this guy, you know, like he always weaponized my cardio.
*  It was like, brother, whoever we fight, you're going to outwork him.
*  So let's just get your speed up, stay fast, get a little bit bigger
*  without being too much to get to where he didn't.
*  He was the main one.
*  He's like, I don't want to give up strength.
*  I don't want to give up conditioning for strength, brother, like
*  because the idea is the more muscle you have, the more endurance it's going to require.
*  Yeah. And especially like even with everybody, like I train with bigger guys,
*  you know, here and there.
*  And I never ever once felt like, holy shit, this guy is so much stronger than me.
*  Like I never ever once felt that way.
*  You know, you hear these talks of some people saying, oh, this guy's very strong.
*  So I try to go with him.
*  I was like, he's all right.
*  You know, it's not like, oh, my God, he's going to be strong.
*  So I felt like.
*  I know how to fight to my strength, I guess.
*  Like, yeah, he might be physically stronger than me, but I know certain techniques
*  or certain ways to put my body that I can get away with how strong I am
*  and not make him feel as strong as he is, you know, and that's what it is.
*  You know, I keep telling a lot of these, a lot of these MMA guys are just people
*  coming up, even my amateur are amateur fighters that's coming up.
*  I just keep telling them, like, brother, there's no difference between me and you.
*  The only difference is my experience.
*  You know, like that even with even with UFC fighters, you know, like the only
*  difference between top 15 and top 10 is experience and their mindset, you know,
*  top 10 to five experience mindset, five to championship, same thing.
*  And then the champion and maybe like the top three guys after that is like,
*  it's just a mind.
*  It's a mind thing, but this shit is easy.
*  Most of these things that is hard is because you make it hard.
*  A lot of guys make it hard for themselves.
*  I'm like, what are you doing?
*  You're beating yourself up for what?
*  This is just fucking practice.
*  Get better.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's all you got to do.
*  Stop, stop beating yourself up.
*  And, um, but you have a great mentality for that.
*  You're able to like go past losses easily is what it is.
*  And you keep moving and you're on the path.
*  But for some people, like losses are devastating because their whole
*  identity is based on success.
*  Yeah.
*  And if they don't get success, then they feel like they're a loser.
*  But even with that, the whole identity thing, that's what it is.
*  Like even when like, uh, you see guys with retiring from other sports or our
*  sport, like they have that identity crisis because they're so known for one thing.
*  And then that's gonna tell them like, that's come, I love doing other stuff.
*  Like people, bro.
*  Oh my God.
*  I stream, I stream on kick now.
*  I stream on kick.com and, um, brother, I during the whole fight, I'm streaming
*  and they're like, yup, thank you for this, max.
*  I'm putting my house on Gagey now.
*  She's training while you playing fucking video games.
*  I'm like, what the fuck?
*  I was like, bro, I need to be training for 24 hours a day.
*  Like a fucking cyborg or something.
*  What the hell?
*  Like, yup, yup, yup.
*  You, yeah.
*  Look, look at you over here.
*  I freaking, I do slots on there.
*  You know, I gambled, like we play fun.
*  You're like, yup, look at you doing this shit, losing money.
*  You're going to lose your fight too.
*  I'm like, what the fuck?
*  Like, bro, you can't catch a break, bro.
*  Those are just losers.
*  Unfortunately, I don't mean anything bad to you guys out there, but if you're
*  commenting to a guy like that, you're a loser.
*  There's no way you're a winner.
*  It's not possible.
*  It's not possible that you're excelling at whatever you do.
*  No one comes to you like that's Mike.
*  He's the best.
*  No one, no chance.
*  No, no.
*  If you're commenting like that on people, you're just, you're a loser.
*  And that's unfortunate.
*  I've been a loser in my life.
*  You know, it's, it's, uh, it's common.
*  Yeah, it's common, but you're a loser.
*  And winners don't think that way.
*  And the idea that a guy can't play some video games and unwind while
*  he's in the middle of camp, you're out of your fucking mind.
*  You don't understand.
*  Yeah, brother.
*  You don't understand what you're talking about.
*  I saw it like, I like talking to mighty cause mighty, me and mighty
*  did an interview, he's the best.
*  Yeah.
*  He's the man.
*  And he was just telling me like, it's so funny.
*  Cause every time I tell everybody, like fighting is easy.
*  Like a lot of people look at me crazy.
*  They're like, what you mean?
*  It's easy.
*  I was like, bro, anything you do in life is easy.
*  Is this that you make it hard?
*  A lot of assholes make it hard for themselves.
*  Like it's actually pretty easy.
*  You know, it's like, if you look at the steps, these are the steps.
*  Yeah.
*  You might fall down in the sense of, in the sense of actually getting it done.
*  It's going to be hard work, but it's easy.
*  Cause you know what you got to do.
*  Right.
*  And I told mighty when I told money about fighting, mighty was the first guy
*  ever that said like, bro, that's what I tell everybody until fighting is easy.
*  I was like, holy shit.
*  If the MMA goat is telling you fighting is easy, stop harassing me.
*  Go harass him.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Go tell him.
*  He said it too.
*  I think it's easy for you.
*  And I think it's easy for mighty because you guys are real champions.
*  You have this champion mindset and that's what people need to learn.
*  They need to learn a mindset for improvement, a mindset for getting better at
*  things and a mindset for staying positive.
*  100%.
*  That's what it's it.
*  That's really what it's about.
*  100%.
*  You can apply that to anything in life.
*  So a guy like you that's a champion in MMA, you could do anything, man.
*  All you need is just like, whatever that thing is, focus on that thing.
*  And if you put the same kind of attention on that thing that you
*  put on your MMA career.
*  Oh yeah.
*  As I told it, I tell everybody, I told, uh, it's so funny whenever me and my,
*  me and my wife, she always always, I was like, you so lucky I wasn't a surfer.
*  I would have been a world champion surfer.
*  I I'm bad at surfing.
*  Okay.
*  I'm bad, but I told her, but you're lucky that I don't put my effort into it.
*  Cause I want to be bad.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  And that's a fact.
*  How did you get so good at that jump spinning back kick brother?
*  Just practice, bro.
*  I did anybody show you.
*  Do you remember?
*  Do you remember me telling you it was here?
*  It's a bio grip.
*  I will be learning strikes in the game.
*  I was one of the strikes.
*  Yeah.
*  That's one of the strikes, brother.
*  I saw the strikes in the game.
*  I was like, Henenborough, Henenborough, do it, do it.
*  Do it nice.
*  I was like, with Dustin Kimura, I told him, brother, we need to do this.
*  Spinning back kick shit.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just so good.
*  And it's a secret weapon.
*  And, and then the thing is funny because in the game I was throwing it close.
*  Like a lot of people throw it from distance, but I throw it real close,
*  like almost in clinch.
*  That's why I asked.
*  Yeah.
*  And I told him like, bro, this is going to be a secret weapon.
*  I remember Dustin Kimura, he, he, he was in the UFC for a little bit.
*  And, um, and I, and I was trying to make him practice it with me.
*  He was, I remember him saying one time like, fuck this kick, this kick is stupid as hell.
*  And then, uh, we kept practicing, kept practicing.
*  Uh, another guy, a big guy came down, trained us and he dropped them when
*  it's being back kicked and from the clinch, right?
*  And I was like, well, I told you about the, I told you this fucking
*  kick is a secret weapon.
*  How are you practicing it close up?
*  What's the drill?
*  We, he would just stand close.
*  I was like, bro, like I would, I'd get my timing from, from it being a distance
*  first, and then we'd be like, live it closer and be like, bro, we got it.
*  All we got to focus on is bringing our knee up and then, and then
*  pushing it out at the last second.
*  And the main thing was just bringing your knee up and snapping your head around.
*  Snap your head around first, see where you're going to land.
*  So you don't kick each other in the fricking groin area.
*  Cause it happened a couple of times to me and him.
*  So, but yeah, it was like bringing the up high look and it's, and then push it.
*  Do you ever practice where you stand right next to the bag?
*  Yeah, I practice on the bag.
*  Yeah.
*  Try to just jumps back, jump back and I create my distance from
*  jumping me jumping away from the bag.
*  And it's that.
*  If you can develop that, that is a secret weapon because it's one of those
*  techniques. It's like, you remember when the calf kick came along,
*  everybody's got to throw a calf.
*  If you could develop that, Yair has it.
*  Yair does it really well, but this was a giant moment in the beginning of the
*  look, look how close you are.
*  Look how close you are to be able to get that off from there and to hit him in
*  the nose. His nose was gone.
*  Yeah. I mean, you shattered his nose at the very end of the first round.
*  And from, from then on, what a fight, man.
*  I watched that fight at least 10 times.
*  No bullshit. At least I watched it over and over again in the gym.
*  I would lie to tell you if I didn't watch it that much.
*  And dude, I always pause.
*  I always pause no matter what I'm doing.
*  If I'm at the gym, I pause for that last 10 seconds.
*  Just like this. Like, how is this real?
*  How is this real?
*  You got that jump spinning back kick down, dude.
*  You got it down in the most unusual way, which is this hop back and then throw it.
*  Like Raymond Daniels does that really good.
*  Even you, like back in the day, it was a video game and I started looking at spinning back kicks.
*  There's a clip of you hitting a fucking kill in the back, bro.
*  Yeah. I was like, what the fuck, Jorok, you get fight?
*  What the hell is going on? This guy kill you with a spinning back kick.
*  There's only one clip of me in a taekwondo fight.
*  It's me knocking a dude out with a spinning back kick.
*  Holy shit. And I sent him flying.
*  But it's the same exact move.
*  The guy's moving forward and I just jump and spin at the same time.
*  It was the same move because I was like in the air when I landed it.
*  That's crazy. That was my favorite thing to do.
*  So when I see a guy like you doing it from up close and I know you learned how to fucking strike from video games,
*  which is so crazy.
*  When you told me that the first time I was like, what?
*  I thought, oh, we went to like a traditional karate school and then he started studying Muay Thai when he was 10.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  I saw cool stuff happening in the game.
*  I was like, oh, bro, we could put this together in real life.
*  And that's Dustin.
*  We never have striking coach.
*  You know, I didn't have Ivan yet.
*  And then after the corner fight is when Ivan, Ivan Flores joined my camp.
*  So and then with him, with Ivan is a genius.
*  Like he's like real like he really he like he loves the basic stuff.
*  But then when I try to tell him or show him fancy stuff or I see Muay Thai doing shit like sweep the leg and the elbow and stuff or whatever, it's like it's crazy.
*  You know, like even even this fight week, bro, like if you watch the fight a bunch of times, I'm doing this right kick.
*  I do this right kick and then I just step over on my right hand or against Gachie.
*  Yes, I just saw we saw that.
*  Like we I practice that I do that a bunch of times in other fights.
*  But then like two weeks before the fight, he sent me a clip on Instagram.
*  They all look at this, watch this and was I forget who it was.
*  But the guy, the Muay Thai guy was right kicking.
*  He set up with a right low kick.
*  Next one, right low kick, right overhand and like her and kills guys.
*  He's downing guys with it.
*  And I was like, holy shit, we know we know Justin likes to like stay there after kicks to throw.
*  So I was like, brother, this is going to work on Justin.
*  So we just kind of added in our game.
*  I told him, bro, I think I'm going to throw this in the fight.
*  He's like, yeah, let's practice it.
*  You know, so Ivan Flores is the man, bro.
*  He's the man.
*  You have an amazing camp.
*  Yeah, all my coaches is the man.
*  I really do have an amazing, amazing group of people.
*  But you also it's the argument that a lot of guys have been making that a smaller camp is maybe better for some athletes.
*  Because there's a lot of guys who want to go to like ATT.
*  But, you know, the guy like I talked to Jim Miller about this and he said that he really started improving much more when he concentrated on himself and had a smaller camp and he stopped teaching.
*  Yeah, and at the end of the day, these big camps, you know, like even even in Vegas, bro, like I hear everybody going to Vegas and training, training and like, bro, like one of the guys out there was telling me it's like the wild, wild west.
*  So like, how do you get better every day you're going to train and just knowing I might fight this guy.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, I might I might have to fight this guy.
*  You know, like I have I have guys my weight, some some guys my weight in my in my class.
*  And and I told him, brother, like, like, I would tell him, like, if we ever got to the point where we're both in the UFC, we're fighting for fricking a lot of money, like, you better sign that damn contract.
*  We don't kill each other here.
*  But you my brother, you know, we don't kill each other and stuff for free.
*  You'd be stupid as hell to not take a fight against me in the UFC or whatever.
*  But that's different from going to a big gym and like, and actually being worried.
*  Like, I'm not worried, you know, if we fight, we fight.
*  But like some of these guys, you go in there and fighting your your life.
*  It's like a fight every day of the week.
*  And that shit is going to fucking like a mentally, brother, that is going to beat you down every day going like, oh, my God, I'm fighting for my life here.
*  Oh, my God.
*  I feel I feel fight like everybody can take a hit and call me a liar and whatever.
*  But, bro, in the fight, I'm nervous as hell in the back.
*  But with the Justin fight, this last one, I was telling people I was like, what the fuck am I doing here?
*  Why am I fighting Justin?
*  What the hell are you doing, Max?
*  You know, like, like that, bro, I'm not even lying.
*  I'm in the back.
*  I'm in the back thinking like fucking like, what are we doing?
*  You told you told me this is the last time.
*  What the hell is it like now?
*  You're on USC 300.
*  You'd be a fucking a million people going to buy this pay per view.
*  What the hell are you doing?
*  And then as soon as the lights come on, I started hearing my song.
*  That's when it changes, you know, and then it's like it's school time.
*  It's like, no, Max, you can't be fucking working McDonald's making this much money.
*  Let's go get this paper.
*  You got to own McDonald's if you're making this much money, brother.
*  You don't own shit.
*  So let's go get it.
*  Multiple McDonald's with the next one.
*  Yeah.
*  After that fight.
*  That was the plan.
*  That was the that was it, you know, so you got to switch, flip the switch and then
*  I know a lot of my coaches, they didn't know my walkout song was funny
*  because they was like, is he going to do it?
*  Because they was waiting for me to walk out to Israel song, right?
*  Come on, can be one of these.
*  Are you going to do it?
*  He's going to do it.
*  And then we walked out to Hawaiian, Hawaiian Superman, Maui Hawaiian Superman.
*  So I loved it, but I think it was perfect.
*  They made the you was out there in the crowd.
*  I don't know if you could see it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  On your screen, they made it look like the ocean, bro.
*  They made they made me look like it was the ocean and that the way we had to turn
*  in our song so early, bro.
*  So like usually I can turn in my song like the week of the fight or the week before
*  the fight walkout song.
*  But Heidi hit us up like eight, six weeks out.
*  It was like, Hey, we need you guys walk out song now because we're trying to do
*  something.
*  And then that was what they did.
*  They the lights that was on the chairs that all the guys had, they made it.
*  They made it go to the song.
*  Like they made mine look like the ocean.
*  So it was like wavy.
*  But then Justin's one was sick because like every time the beat hit the lights on
*  the stuff went up and like whatever, I was like, Whoa, that's cool.
*  So what was Justin's walkout song?
*  I forget, but it was a really good song, bro.
*  I liked it.
*  It was a really good song.
*  It has some banger walkout songs, man.
*  But Politan when that motherfucker walks out, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
*  I didn't even hear it.
*  Is it crazy?
*  He's the scariest motherfucker when he walks out because he stands there.
*  He walks out like this.
*  Yeah.
*  I know he stands there, draws the bow back and goes, ah, and then he throws a
*  couple of punches.
*  He does his one, two, bro.
*  So you know what is funny?
*  You know, I don't know if you ever watched that kid of like, he mimics, like
*  he mimics fights or fighters.
*  He had a kid.
*  So he was at the press conference, bro.
*  And the whole fucking press conference, I've seen him and he's trying to one,
*  two, three, one, two, three, bro, the whole time he got busted from, uh, from a
*  security guard to sit down.
*  But the whole time that I watched him, he was throwing it.
*  I was like, but I got it.
*  That kid is crazy.
*  Have you said mighty mouse to everybody?
*  No, no, no.
*  Mighty mouse.
*  There's a video.
*  Oh yeah, I did.
*  I called him up.
*  I called them on.
*  I said, why didn't you make mine?
*  She's like, ah, bro, I got you.
*  I got you the next one.
*  Yeah.
*  He could do everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He was good.
*  But he's, he mimics everyone's style.
*  He does Khabib.
*  He does Connor.
*  He does, you know, but so who does, he does everybody.
*  Right.
*  He's a beast.
*  Mighty mouse is the goat.
*  When I say, when I say the best martial artists that I've ever seen in terms of
*  like the expression of martial arts, he's my favorite.
*  It's him.
*  He's the bro.
*  If you, if you don't have him, if you don't have him on top of your, your, your,
*  MMA rush Mount war, whatever it is.
*  Mount Rushmore.
*  Mount Rushmore.
*  Yeah.
*  I think of my son when I said rush Mount Rushmore, but if you don't have him on it,
*  you're just a hater.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to be a hater.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody, everybody keeps talking about like, even that, like everybody keep talking
*  about like, oh, he's only 125.
*  I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  The walkouts.
*  Okay.
*  What?
*  See, see it blinks.
*  I don't know who's saying those names.
*  I don't know.
*  What is that?
*  I had this thing going too.
*  Oh, so here's.
*  My show the mighty mouse one.
*  Cause that was, that's incredible.
*  So here's mighty mouse pretending to be so hoodo.
*  So they switch, they switch about Shricklin.
*  It looks exactly like it's crazy.
*  The gregor that is good bro.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Mighty.
*  He does add a sign here too.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, look at this.
*  Wow.
*  You hear Yuri Prohoscos talking about going down to 85.
*  Is he?
*  Yeah.
*  He apparently didn't cut any weight for that fight.
*  Yeah.
*  I, yeah.
*  Me and him is managed by the same guy and that's what I heard too.
*  He's a wild boy.
*  Oh, did you not see it?
*  He was outside of USC 300.
*  Yeah.
*  At four o'clock in the morning.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I started at Tuesday and T-Mobile.
*  Yeah.
*  And the fans are looking scared as hell.
*  That dude's real.
*  He's so cool bro.
*  He's so cool.
*  Bro, did you not see he just freaking wanted, you know, he's the other one that
*  wanted to do on your bonus right.
*  And then the first post I'm back home.
*  I'm in my hut.
*  How are we doing?
*  Like he lived bro.
*  He actually lives in that hut in the forest.
*  Does he really?
*  Yeah.
*  Bro, he works out punching trees.
*  Dudes out there throwing front kicks at trees and shit.
*  The guy, the guy is unreal bro.
*  The guy is unreal bro.
*  Animal.
*  He's in there cause Rackets was putting it on him, man.
*  And he was just melting Rackets.
*  They some big dudes are like all fight week.
*  When I, when I went to the PI, Racket was me, Racket and Hill.
*  And these bro, these guys are big guys, but I'm like, Holy shit.
*  You guys some big dudes.
*  Yeah.
*  They're huge.
*  And Uri at 185 would be terrifying.
*  He's got such a crazy style, man.
*  I mean, there's no one that fights like that guy.
*  Like if you saw his silhouette, you would be able to tell instantly.
*  That's Prohaska.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But he does have hands down, chin forward, you know, the fucking crazy hair.
*  Yeah.
*  He's not right.
*  Bun.
*  Bro.
*  He's, he, he just a samurai spirit, bro.
*  It's not a facade.
*  No, he really, a lot of guys think so.
*  Yeah.
*  No, he's like, and he's a real bro.
*  He's a really nice guy.
*  Like you ever talk story to him?
*  Yeah, I've talked to him.
*  Bro.
*  He's so nice.
*  He's very nice.
*  He's very quiet.
*  Like he's a, his tone is very, yeah, I'm good, but yeah, like, like bro, he's almost like,
*  he's like the guy that you call to go kill somebody for you.
*  He hit man, you know, he's like, I need a hit man.
*  Okay, brother.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  So that fight was a wild fight too.
*  It's like, there's so many fights that got lost.
*  The, the fight, your fight, especially that knockout was so crazy that people forgot
*  that you fucked Dustin up the first part of the fifth round.
*  Like I kind of forgot about it until I watched it again.
*  I was like, oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm almost, yeah, I almost heard him.
*  Yeah.
*  Almost heard him, but you know, Oh, you heard him even, even, even, even when, uh, I call
*  my dad, you know, and you're going to love this one.
*  But then I went like this.
*  And then when I was, when I was flirting him, everybody in every round, every time I heard
*  him, I'd come in, I'll do a little bit.
*  And if it didn't put him down or hurt him more, I just backed off.
*  Cause everybody's like, why is he not attacking?
*  Why is he not attacking?
*  I'm like, brother, every time I heard him, he had the craziest look in his eyes.
*  And one time he said, let's get it on.
*  So I was okay.
*  You know, I was like, no, I'm okay, brother.
*  I'm here.
*  I'm going to keep picking you.
*  You know, but he did, he did.
*  Well, just like he did have the craziest look in his eyes, but it was, it was crazy.
*  Like I would hurt.
*  I was like, why are you even standing bro?
*  You know, like, and then I just thinking, yeah, you're right.
*  You're Justin Gagey.
*  Yeah.
*  You're a fricking highlight.
*  You know, so he said the wildest shit before the fight.
*  So don't make plans after my fights.
*  Cause I'm playing on being here.
*  Yeah.
*  When I saw that, I was like, what the fuck?
*  Is this guy human?
*  You know what I mean?
*  How the hell did he get led into Wakanda?
*  It's not very Wakanda mindset, you know?
*  Oh, there's one thing that has come up that I think we probably should talk about and
*  it's the Paheta Jamal Hill knockout.
*  Uh huh.
*  And it is, it's an interesting thing that was brought up and I didn't think anything
*  of it at the time.
*  And then I watched it again.
*  I was like, hmm, there's kind of a point there.
*  And the point is Jamal accidentally hits him low.
*  He like kicks him in the hip and, uh, Herb Dean comes in to stop it.
*  And then Paheta does the super gangster thing.
*  But in the meantime, Jamal has stopped and relaxed after he threw the kick.
*  He gives him a thumbs up, like you cool?
*  And then Paheta does it and then Paheta advances and then Herb is to the left.
*  So it's like, he kicks him in the hip.
*  He's to the left.
*  So it's like he can't even move too much to the left.
*  And all of a sudden he's on him and he hits him with that left hook.
*  And I think Jamal saying I would have never let him that close to me if it wasn't for
*  that nut shot.
*  And I didn't know exactly what was going on.
*  So Herb had stopped it.
*  Herb is out of his field of vision.
*  Herb is over here.
*  So when Herb's doing this, I don't know what he said.
*  I don't know if, let's see if we can watch it.
*  Because he stood, I think so.
*  I think so.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  He stands there and kind of like half touch gloves with him, right?
*  And then Alex is using a touch glove to step in to it.
*  And then Alex throws the left hook.
*  Alex steps on his foot.
*  Steps on his foot.
*  That's the old boxing trick, brother.
*  The old boxing trick.
*  Southpaw Northodox.
*  So he steps on his front foot and then hits him with that left hook from hell.
*  His left hook is a crazy weapon, man.
*  That thing don't even look hard.
*  It's crazy.
*  Tell me not.
*  It just looks like, and then when, did you not see the jolt that it sent down his body?
*  Yeah, you see his eyes roll back.
*  He almost did a, was he the one that knocked out Johnny Walker?
*  Yeah, he almost did the Johnny Walker.
*  His body kind of extended.
*  That was kind of crazy.
*  I was like, oh wow.
*  And it was a glancing blow.
*  Glancing, brother.
*  And it was like, it wasn't even a hook.
*  It was like an uppercut hook.
*  Yeah, like a shovel hook.
*  Yeah, like a Mexican hook.
*  The way he lands it, man.
*  You don't give a shit, bro.
*  The fight that he got before he fought in the UFC, did you ever see that one?
*  No.
*  Is the most vicious left hook knockout of all time.
*  He hits a dude with a high kick.
*  The guy blocks it.
*  He steps.
*  The guy steps.
*  Whack!
*  He just cleanly, you know, he's got that long frame.
*  He's so long.
*  And there's all this torque.
*  And he just torques his whole body and whips across.
*  It sounds like a baseball bat hitting a watermelon.
*  Just whap!
*  And the dude just drops faceplants.
*  Harder people just have that kind of power, right?
*  His power is crazy.
*  He punched the machine.
*  The machine I saw.
*  The machine.
*  191.
*  How much did you spin back kick on?
*  Did you kick directly?
*  I never kicked with a spinning back kick.
*  But with a roundhouse kick, I got to 152.
*  That's crazy.
*  But the difference between that and 190 with one punch.
*  See right there, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Here it is.
*  The eclipse.
*  Now, let's back it up again because let's make the argument.
*  Let's see what happens.
*  So, go all the way to the nut shot.
*  So, here's the nut shot.
*  So, now, watch Jamal.
*  Jamal stops.
*  Watch his legs get locked up.
*  He's relaxed.
*  He gives a thumbs up.
*  We cool?
*  We cool?
*  And he touches Herb.
*  So, now they're back at it.
*  Yeah, but look at his stance.
*  He's ready to strike.
*  Yeah, Paheta has never relaxed.
*  So, this time has gone on.
*  This is a little, we're doing it in slow motion, right?
*  Let's do it in real speed.
*  So, here we see this.
*  So, here we see this.
*  So, here we see this.
*  So, you know, the fight had restarted.
*  The fight had restarted.
*  But would that have, would that position have taken place if it wasn't for Jamal relaxing?
*  Yeah.
*  Giving him the thumbs up.
*  So, you know, like not his fight.
*  So, my fight, the number one thing when I was going with Justin was just be on all the time.
*  Right.
*  Like just fucking max.
*  Like I was just in the back time.
*  I was like mentally, physically, you need to be here every fucking second.
*  Right.
*  Every millisecond, brother.
*  Which is a crazy thing.
*  Because you, one millisecond off, lights can turn off max.
*  You need to be on.
*  So, that was the main thing that I was telling myself the whole fight, you know.
*  Like with that, like if I was in a situation, I would have told her, motherfucker, are we going?
*  Like I would have been like, come on.
*  Like I still would have been ready, you know.
*  Like it's protect yourself at all times, you know.
*  There is a weird millisecond where no one knows what's going on.
*  And when Paheta is still moving forward.
*  But Paheta, look at Paheta.
*  He's, that millisecond, he's still like, he's going to burn air out of your ass.
*  So, watch it again.
*  Watch it again.
*  So, low kick.
*  And then as Jamal, stop it.
*  Go all the way from the beginning.
*  Watch this.
*  So, when Jamal lands the kick, he touches him and then he makes, look at the distance he closes.
*  Yeah, oh yeah.
*  Look how close he is.
*  Right there, right there.
*  Yeah, look how close he is.
*  He closed the distance.
*  But back it up again.
*  So, you see the distance that Jamal's maintaining initially.
*  Then he throws the kick.
*  Now watch this.
*  They pause.
*  Jamal thumbs up.
*  But Paheta's closed the gap now.
*  Right there, look how close he is.
*  He's closed the gap a lot more than Jamal probably would have let him.
*  Now, it's a mistake by Jamal, protect yourself at all times.
*  But also, it does seem like there's a moment of confusion.
*  There is, there is.
*  Because he does close that distance.
*  He does, bro.
*  Significantly.
*  It's like a double step.
*  Watch.
*  From here to there.
*  He hops, he hops into it.
*  Look, right there, hop, hop.
*  Yeah.
*  And now you're in the danger zone.
*  That's fucking Kenny Rogers or Kenny Loggins.
*  Highway to the danger zone.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And so once he does that, that little hop in, he takes advantage of that moment to close the gap.
*  The left hook is so clean, bro.
*  Look at this.
*  So he doesn't stop when Herb stops him.
*  He closes, when he puts her to one, he closes the gap.
*  He closes the distance and then he throws her to the top.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Or during that whole time.
*  So watch it.
*  Watch it.
*  It's this.
*  Yeah, right, right.
*  And he's doing this while Jamal's legs are straight.
*  So Jamal gives him the thumbs up and Paheta had a double hop in that time.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And Jamal didn't know.
*  Yeah.
*  This is a real moment.
*  Now, I'm not making any excuses for Jamal.
*  And Jamal can take a loss as good as anybody.
*  And after the Paul Craig fight, he's like, I fucked up.
*  He got me.
*  This is it.
*  But he's got a point here.
*  It's not a perfect point because they had engaged again.
*  But Paheta had closed that gap to a point where Jamal was not letting him do that early.
*  But then again, playing devil advocate, nothing but love for Jamal.
*  But fuck, bro, you need to be locked in there.
*  You need to be locked in.
*  Who the fuck cares?
*  You're fighting another dangerous man, the man across you that you know each other.
*  You guys land one good shot.
*  You guys both can put each other away.
*  It's like, I don't know, bro.
*  Because at the end of the day.
*  It's a mistake on his part.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Because you always have to be ready.
*  But with her, it sucks.
*  How much times do we hear a freaking judge or even a ref screwing up the fight?
*  You know what I mean?
*  So it's like, you need to, anybody, fighters, amateur level, pro level, the best fighters in the world, whatever it is.
*  Don't put it in these guys' hands, man.
*  I mean, it's easier said than done.
*  But don't leave it.
*  It's just tough.
*  Be aware.
*  Just be aware.
*  You do have a third man in there.
*  They are supposed to be looking out for you.
*  But how much time do we see where sometimes that's just not the case or it's just too early.
*  So at the end of the day, fuck it sucks.
*  But what are you going to do there?
*  You know what I mean?
*  All we're going to do is we're going to have this kind of talks and arguments and he's going to have arguments and stuff and nothing's going to get changed.
*  But here's the question.
*  What is the protocol?
*  When a referee steps in and says stop because there's a low.
*  Even when you tell him stop, the protocol should have been like, OK, separate.
*  OK, whatever.
*  Go back to the middle.
*  Like you pushed him against the cage.
*  Whatever. We saw you hop.
*  OK, you want me to stop back up a little bit.
*  Let's let me go.
*  He needs to go in the middle of them and be like, OK, fight.
*  Right.
*  You can't be like, get stopped and then you moved off to the side.
*  OK, fight.
*  Fight to here.
*  Because if if if what's his name, Jamal couldn't see him.
*  I can understand like in his peripherals, like he's just focused, you know, and then maybe stuff stays fighting.
*  I'm just focused on you.
*  OK, what's going on?
*  You know, right.
*  There's there's definitely an argument that if you're going to do that and you're going to stop a fight momentarily, even if you're going to restart, you have to understand that the momentum has stopped.
*  Things have changed.
*  And if one guy does this and hops in during that time, you kind of have to step and separate them and then engage.
*  So he does the engage.
*  He goes off to the side.
*  But now the argument against that that I've heard is that this happens all the times where fighters get kicked and the referee says, hold on.
*  The fighter says, I'm fine.
*  And then they let him keep going.
*  So maybe that's a good argument, too, that Jamal should have been more prepared.
*  But it seems like he had actually told them to stop.
*  And that's when Jamal did this.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So it's like, excuse me, Alex did this.
*  So is that up to the fighter?
*  What are the rules?
*  Yeah, what are the rules?
*  Like when the referee says stop, are the fighters allowed to say no, I'm fine?
*  Or are they supposed to address the referee and say, I'm fine?
*  He said time.
*  Yeah, he says time.
*  And he puts his hand up.
*  And now where's Herb Dean?
*  Herb Dean moves away.
*  Jamal does not have eyes on him.
*  Yeah, yeah. He's looking at him all the time because he's not trying to get cracked.
*  Jamal does it.
*  But Alex is much closer to him now.
*  Yeah, he's much closer.
*  And nobody, but look at the angle that he takes too.
*  Like Alex is, Alex is, he's cutting off the cage there.
*  Yeah, he's cutting off the cage.
*  You're pushing him to his right to cut off the cage, bro.
*  And Herb is right to Jamal's left.
*  Yeah, look at that. That was beautiful.
*  Yeah, it was beautiful. Beautiful.
*  Yeah, that was crazy.
*  He's a monster.
*  That guy's a monster.
*  I was telling everybody about that guy when he was in glory.
*  I remember.
*  When they were saying he was coming over to the UFC, I was like, I told DC, I go, dude, get ready for this motherfucker.
*  Because this motherfucker puts people into orbit.
*  Brother.
*  He's got crazy power.
*  Brother, the wormholes, bro.
*  Universe, different universes.
*  You wake up on the other side of the galaxy.
*  Brother, he might have, actually, you know, since we're talking about Wakanda, he might be like a Dr. Strange guy.
*  He might have the ring on, brother.
*  Look underneath his glove or something. That's what's happening, bro.
*  Well, what he is is a real Amazon warrior.
*  Like that's his jeans.
*  Yeah, you see him, bro. You see him go back to his village.
*  Yeah.
*  He will all paint it up and stuff like a leopard.
*  Yeah, bro.
*  Bro, guy's a G, bro. He's a G.
*  He's a real deal. He's a real deal.
*  He's a man.
*  How the fuck was he ever making 185 is the big question.
*  And how much do you think that compromised his chin when he went down to the ring?
*  A lot, bro.
*  So the thing is, you know what is crazy?
*  You know what?
*  Here's the walk.
*  Look at his foot.
*  Bro, that shit is terrifying.
*  Look at his eyes, man.
*  And everybody just, and he told Jamal, when I make my walk in, then you'll think about all these things you said.
*  Yeah, he did.
*  Ha! And the whole audience yells out, ha! with him.
*  Look at Jamal, though.
*  He caught the, did you see it in the other angle?
*  He caught the arrow. He broke it.
*  Yeah.
*  That was cool.
*  He was telling me, when I talked to him about it, he said, he feels like he was winning that fight.
*  He said he was implementing his strategy.
*  He landed that one good right hook in the first round.
*  And he felt like he was on his way.
*  He felt like he was doing everything he wanted to do, not letting that dude get close, but that thing fucked him up.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's a sport.
*  There's a real moment there.
*  That's a sport, right?
*  It is a sport.
*  That's a sport, right?
*  You know what is funny, brother?
*  You know, like, you know, nothing to Jamal, whatever.
*  But what is crazy is that when I read, when I read, I see comments, I see people talking about our fight.
*  And like guys like bringing up like, oh, yeah, just imagine, imagine if Justin didn't break his nose.
*  It would have been a whole different fight.
*  I'm like, well, thank the Lord.
*  I landed my spin back hit because his nose was broken.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Imagine if you didn't knock him out.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Or just imagine if I broke my ankle walking into the frickin' octagon.
*  Imagine.
*  Brother, there's so much stuff.
*  I'm like, what are you like?
*  People are so crazy.
*  I'm like, oh my God, like, just enjoy it.
*  Why can't you guys enjoy it?
*  Why can't you guys let other people have stuff?
*  You know, like, why can't we have nice stuff?
*  This is why we can't have good things.
*  Again, it's just losers.
*  You know, you think Michael Jordan's leaving YouTube comments?
*  No, it's not.
*  Oh brother, never.
*  It's winners don't have time for that shit.
*  But that's also part of the game.
*  You're going to have to deal with those people.
*  But that's how anybody can say imagine if you didn't land something that you landed, that you planned for, that you executed.
*  That's very hard to pull off.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  A spinning back kick where you literally ride in front of each other like that.
*  And you landed to his face.
*  Yeah, bro.
*  We knew he was on the duck.
*  He was looking for the time, you know?
*  Yeah, it was perfect.
*  It was perfect.
*  And it was such a great moment on that night because that night was magical.
*  Bro, 3, yeah, bro.
*  UFC 300, I can't, my head is still not wrapped around it.
*  You know, like how you said, how do I feel?
*  I don't know how I feel yet.
*  Because it's still not wrapped.
*  Right.
*  To have that, to be one of the guys to, it started from all the way outside of fight, brother.
*  Somebody asked me to get the belt wrapped around Mark Coleman.
*  Like when they asked me who I think, and then I said Mark Coleman.
*  You know, I'm like, bro, he's the guy.
*  His house with his fires and stuff just happened.
*  So I was like, he's the man.
*  And then to it being UFC 300, to us getting asked, oh, what about the, how much should the freaking bonuses be?
*  And I'm freaking screaming, 300k, 300k, 300k.
*  And Dustin, Dustin, and freaking Dana to be like 300k.
*  I was like, holy shit.
*  And then to win both the bonuses, it was just crazy.
*  And then to have the, like you said, bro, that's a movie finish, bro.
*  To hit him with an overhand, to hit, it was like a David versus Goliath kind of story going against him, you know.
*  And then to hit him with that overhand is like me hitting him with the slingshot, you know.
*  And also, and the rock at the perfect place, perfect time, the perfect bro.
*  This is UFC 300.
*  Nobody's event getting put together.
*  This is not going to top nothing to 400.
*  And we don't even know if 400 is going to top it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, we don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  But it's going to be almost impossible to top that.
*  Like every card after that, you look at the card, you're like, eh, it's okay.
*  Yeah, I know it's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  And then a lot of people, and then bro, Dana White is the, he's the ultimate troll, bro.
*  I love Dana White, them when they troll people.
*  When he made the video, yeah.
*  Yeah, brother.
*  When he saw the video, he's calling out.
*  You know how much people on top of that video too, I also did videos of me talking about how I was like under gun and pillow all the way.
*  Pillow hands all the way is going to get killed.
*  I am going to be the first, Tony 2.0, whatever.
*  I was like, brother, you guys just watch.
*  And all their tones change and now they're making money off of me.
*  I should go write them all money and be like, everybody, you owe me 10% of YouTube.
*  There's all these people that have these takes where they know what's going to happen.
*  It's such a stupid thing to do.
*  You don't know what's going to happen.
*  You could talk about someone's opinion.
*  Yeah, you can talk about you can have an opinion.
*  But when people see stuff like that, I'm like, well, that's crazy.
*  It's just dumb.
*  It's just dumb.
*  You know, you should talk about someone's skills and what they can do.
*  And this could be a factor and that could be a factor.
*  But to say this is going to happen, that is folly.
*  That's a stupid way to look at things.
*  There's not a chance in hell that you know when two world class martial artists fight.
*  There's no chance.
*  There's no chance you know.
*  I saw a lot of people doing that with the fight this past weekend with Devin Haney.
*  Ryan Garcia.
*  Everybody was counting out Ryan Garcia.
*  So many people.
*  Did you see how much he bet on himself?
*  Two million bucks.
*  Can we do that on ourselves?
*  What did he win?
*  How much did he win?
*  12 million.
*  So he bet 2 million to win 12 million.
*  And he paid 2.1 million dollars in fees.
*  So he won 10 million.
*  I think he paid 1.5 in fees because he's 3 pounds over.
*  So he paid 1.5 to Devin Haney because he said 500 every week, right?
*  And he had to pay the extra 600 or 500 to the commission.
*  Wow.
*  So that's what, so it was like 2.1 million dollars he had to throw.
*  And he was like, and he bet on himself.
*  He's like, bro, I don't give a shit.
*  That's a wild boy.
*  I got 2 million dollars in there.
*  Yeah, good for you.
*  That's a wild boy.
*  Dude, that left hook he has is a thing of beauty.
*  It's fast, bro.
*  It's so fast, bro.
*  It's so fast.
*  It's so fast.
*  Bro, and it's so fast and it hits so hard because even, did you see the way Haney like,
*  or not even, not only Haney, but every time he lands it on anybody they're like, they're
*  like, they're getting like shocked.
*  It comes at you so much faster than other punches.
*  It reminds me a lot of Roy Jones in his prime.
*  Yeah.
*  Roy Jones Jr. in his prime barely threw jabs, which is so crazy that a guy would be so fast
*  that he could hit you with a leaping left hook.
*  Yeah, because his jab was a leaping left hook.
*  It was crazy.
*  Boom.
*  You ever seen his biceps, the difference?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  His left bicep is twice the size of his right bicep.
*  It's nuts.
*  He might have been an arm wrestler then.
*  Who knows?
*  Roy Jones had the craziest style of all time.
*  And when he was in his prime, that dude was untouchable.
*  No.
*  Every fight was an execution.
*  Bro, crazy.
*  Body head bangers, bro.
*  He was the bro.
*  He was so fast.
*  He was the only guy in CompuBox history that didn't get a single punch landed on him in
*  a round.
*  For real?
*  Yeah.
*  When he fought Vinny Pazienza, didn't get a single punch landed on him.
*  Boom, jump left hook in.
*  And then he just put it on him.
*  And then he tried to stop the fight himself.
*  He looked at the referee.
*  He's like, stop this fight.
*  And the referee's like, keep fighting.
*  And he's like, all right.
*  And he goes like that.
*  He does like that.
*  And he just tunes him up and KO's him.
*  Bro, what a beast, bro.
*  What a beast.
*  But that left hook is a weapon.
*  If you got a left hook like Ryan Garcia, like, my god, that thing's fast.
*  Ryan, African Pereira.
*  But how smart is Gervonta for making him go to 135 and then giving him a weight clause
*  that you can't rehydrate more than 10 pounds?
*  Who was behind him?
*  Who was behind him, brother?
*  The money mayweather.
*  That guy is smart, bro.
*  That guy is a businessman.
*  These guys are businessmen.
*  You know?
*  Like, it is what it is.
*  Same thing that Floyd did to Canelo.
*  Yeah.
*  Same exact thing.
*  And it was more, you know, it was more funny.
*  Canelo played into his game and said, no, you know what?
*  We'll come down to this weight.
*  He didn't ask.
*  He was going to give them the extra five.
*  But then with a weight clause.
*  And they said, oh, you what?
*  You want to come here?
*  You can come here and a weight clause.
*  Bro, he's a businessman, bro.
*  And you got to respect it.
*  Yes, you have to.
*  And for Gervonta, that was perfect.
*  Because I would love to see Ryan Garcia, the one that we saw fully hydrated against Devin
*  Haney against Gervonta.
*  That's a problem.
*  He's going to be a problem.
*  For everybody.
*  He's going to be a problem.
*  And his speed is bananas.
*  You're seeing Shadowbox like throw combinations.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Is this sped up?
*  How are you so fast?
*  Yeah.
*  It's not fair.
*  He might have one of the fastest left hooks I've ever seen.
*  For sure.
*  I mean, it's right up there with everybody, all the great left hookers of the past.
*  The crazy thing is like, bro, he don't even bring it out.
*  He just goes from right here.
*  Right there.
*  Whip.
*  Like a whip.
*  Just kills guys.
*  He has so much power from short distance.
*  Just nothing.
*  Just turns it over.
*  And he can hit you with multiple ones in a row.
*  He just keeps throwing left hooks.
*  He doesn't even believe in jabs.
*  The funny thing was the troll job.
*  Bro, when he talked about, I just saw the interview the other night.
*  He did Patrick Bette David.
*  Yeah.
*  When he did the, he's like, you know that one interview I was like, doing all that stuff.
*  People thought I was crazy.
*  I was like, bro, I don't give a shit.
*  I was like, oh.
*  I was like, wow.
*  I was like, this guy, bro, he should be an actor.
*  Yeah.
*  He really had a smart strategy.
*  Act like he was crazy.
*  Act like he was crazy.
*  He was crazy.
*  Come in three pounds heavy.
*  And just, bro, he sold it all the way to getting into that, bro.
*  I bet him coming in three pounds heavy made the line move more towards Haney.
*  Oh, I'm sure.
*  Like, this guy's not training.
*  Yeah.
*  He's out of shape.
*  He didn't prepare.
*  He's crazy.
*  He's mentally unstable.
*  Yeah.
*  Jokes on you, brother.
*  He laughed straight to the back.
*  And there was some bad refereeing in that fight too.
*  Because there was two knockdowns.
*  Yeah, because two drops and it didn't count.
*  That was crazy.
*  Real bad.
*  Real bad.
*  Those were two legitimate knockdowns.
*  In a round where he already knocked him down once.
*  So he knocked him down three times in that fight.
*  In that round.
*  Yeah.
*  Wouldn't that have been like a TKO already?
*  I don't know if they had a three knockdown rule.
*  It wasn't for the title, right?
*  Because Devin gets to keep the title.
*  So I think so it was, yeah.
*  Even though he didn't make way.
*  He kept the title.
*  But even if he wins, I think so he would have had the, I mean, whatever.
*  Yeah, but fuck the title.
*  Like, that's crazy.
*  Keeping that title is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  After, bro, you know what is more crazy?
*  There's a post of him being like, yeah, I still got the title.
*  I'm like, wow.
*  Yeah.
*  It's kind of crazy to think, yeah.
*  I was just trying to come up with some sort.
*  I mean, he got humiliated.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he got humbugged.
*  It sucks, but this fight, bro, this fight game is wild, bro.
*  It's a wild game.
*  It's the shit.
*  It's the most craziest game ever, brother.
*  Most ruthless game.
*  You'd be on top of the world one day and we'll fight like that.
*  You're just, no one even cares anymore.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah, you could be Ben Askren, you know?
*  And boom, one shot and then that's what everybody remembers.
*  Oh, bro, yeah.
*  He has an amazing career.
*  He's the best, bro.
*  He's the best.
*  Dominates in Bellator, dominated in one FC, comes over to America, beats Robbie Lawler
*  in a weird one.
*  Remember that?
*  Yeah, yeah, he slammed him.
*  He slammed him.
*  No, he had him in a headlock.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  And Robbie wasn't out.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Robbie was defending and they thought, I don't know who made that call.
*  I forget who was the referee, but they thought he was out and he wasn't out.
*  And Robbie's like, what the fuck, I wasn't out.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And they called the fight.
*  And then Horny and Street Jesus.
*  And then Horny hits him, Street Jesus hits him with some fucking nuclear lightning.
*  Brother, the sprint, oh my gosh.
*  And then turned the angle, like he cuts the angle so that Ben, like his instincts kick
*  in.
*  Yeah.
*  Like shoot for the takedown, just runs right at him and it just goes right into it, man.
*  And then he does the freaking three-pin cut.
*  Tap, tap.
*  Yeah, he hits him with a couple of three-piece when he's down and then slaps the floor and
*  lays next to him.
*  Wow, that was crazy, bro.
*  That was wild.
*  That was one of the wildest knockouts too.
*  That's another one.
*  That's another one, but the consequences are different than yours.
*  Yours is different.
*  And it's the fact that you decided to stand in the cage in the center in the last 10 seconds
*  and that you had planned that out.
*  Did your corner know you were planning that out?
*  Oh, they know already.
*  I mean, they know.
*  You ask any of them and then you tell them like, bro, did you guys think, I never told
*  them, but they already know who I am as a fighter.
*  I've been with these guys for 15, 16 years of my life.
*  Half of my life, brother, I've been with these guys.
*  Wow.
*  Actually, I think 14 years.
*  I think it's 14.
*  A little bit under half of my life with these guys.
*  So they know me.
*  Do you have the corner?
*  Share the corner.
*  Rylan is hiding because he knows what's happening already.
*  My striking coach already knows that it's going to go.
*  They know.
*  I asked them after.
*  They did interviews and interviews and they asked them, did you know Max was going to
*  do that?
*  And he's like, he didn't tell us.
*  But we've got a feeling that if it went to the last 10 seconds, look, look, look, look,
*  look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
*  Dry.
*  Right.
*  He's hiding under his eyes.
*  Look at your guys screaming.
*  Bro.
*  You know what?
*  It's funny that guy.
*  Michael is like five, three.
*  So he's like holding himself up on them.
*  His legs is dangling and he's kicking in the air.
*  Imagine that.
*  He's on top there.
*  Wow.
*  That was wild, man.
*  And then shout out to my best friend birdie bird Jordan read in the back since the news didn't catch it at him
*  They named every corner man except for him in the back
*  So here's a question
*  Jamal Hill loses that fight and now he's gonna fight Khalil round tree roll
*  That was a fit don't don't you think do you think that's a faster round? I don't know. It's a very faster
*  It's only two months. Yeah, it's two months and you find you know, he'll treat a round tree is a
*  Savage brother do you know?
*  Yeah, you owe him a lot of money you do have a lot of money that's how he fights
*  Yeah, he fights you like you stole something from him. His contract is probably a sure win
*  So you he owes you you owe him win money that sidekick that he did to the knee
*  That's the huge jumping into that
*  Horrible as nasty bro. Horrible. Watch his knee bend backwards Khalil. I remember when clear fought Eric Anders
*  He came back from Thailand. So he fights Johnny Walker
*  Johnny Walker catches him with an elbow in the clinch and he decides like I got to really learn Muay Thai
*  Clenching elbows he goes to Thailand and then he fights Eric Anders and he comes out looking like a Thai fighter
*  Ah late kick. Yeah
*  I don't watch that fight. What fight?
*  See we can find Khalil round tree versus Eric
*  I think that was on the the vote I think I was in Vegas and it was on the book to fight
*  I believe it was in Vegas because I remember me and DC were like what?
*  Happened like he was always a very good fighter
*  It was always a very good stand-up fighter too
*  But like he went through this leap in this fight
*  See if you get like early in the fight when the leg kicks were insane and it's the the way he's moving
*  He's moving like a tie. This whole thing was just a second round. Okay. He was moving like a tie like his front leg
*  He's like tapping with the front leg
*  Yeah, and and yeah, look he's finally going already. I mean it was very like Thai style
*  adapted to MMA
*  But we were just like my god like he's looked so much better than we've seen him before
*  There was something about like he made this decision
*  After that Johnny Walker fight and then started going to Thailand and just kicked his game up several notches and now
*  You know he gets this opportunity
*  Khalil to fight a guy who also just got KO'd
*  Right just got KO'd just two months ago. So most people say hey, this is too soon
*  Yeah, a lot of people say this is too soon, but I get it Jamal wants to get back in there
*  He feels like that was a fuck-up and he wants to erase it. He says he's fine, but this is a
*  He's a fucking scary cat man
*  Yeah, because even with even with the Jamal Hill incident right how much shots did he get to take on the ground?
*  Took a few hard ones. Yeah
*  Whatever, but it's a left hook that makes his eyes roll back
*  But Khalil is a monster. Oh, but he but imagine he'll bro. Imagine if you're in you're in this situation, right? You're in issues
*  Like how you said this guy's got knocked out, but you call out there you knock this guy out
*  Guess what? Guess what? Guess what? You're doing next fight
*  Fight for a dime you're fighting for a title, but yeah, you are fighting Alex Pereira for a title
*  Imagine him and Khalil and Alex per head a whole shit
*  It just be violence wrong all crazy violence and you know Khalil's had moments in his career
*  Where he was like not totally focused and then he's had moments where he's really focused and you see it like in his endurance in
*  The fight like this fights that he's lost were just like he wasn't really there
*  But then you see him when he's really focused like it's like you got to pay attention to what he's capable of
*  Like you could look at a fighter sometimes you could look at bad fight like some like a good example is Charles Oliver
*  If you go and watch Charles Oliver as some of his earlier fights, it looks like he kind of like folded
*  Yeah, and then something happened after the birth of his daughter where Charles Oliver becomes this fucking assassin
*  Yeah, he's just in us and he just has no quit in him. He's just an animal
*  Yeah, and it's just like everybody just forgot about that old shit like no, he's the fucking man
*  Yeah, and they forgot about the cub Swanson fight. They forgot about all these other fights
*  They forgot about the Paul Felder fight. They forgot about those fights like fuck all that fight
*  What is he capable of?
*  I'm not what he's on and that's I think what you got to do with Khalil
*  That's why this is a dangerous fight because Jamal's a bad man and he's a dangerous dude. He can knock out anybody
*  It's gonna be the souls Khalil. It's gonna be violent bro. I tomorrow gonna have to watch his kneecaps, bro
*  She's gonna have to watch his legs everything and Khalil is also Southpaw. So Jamal standing Southpaw, you know
*  Bro that was horrific that was horrific. I mean he's just sidekick this shit out of his knee just blew it apart man
*  And that's real controversial because a lot of people like man that ends your career
*  but
*  Does he's back?
*  He sees a fucking animal man, I mean he's so skillful and so
*  Intelligent in his stand-up and it's just like shit. It's super super high level man
*  Oh, look, he tried to trust kick a guy his body way
*  Yeah, he's done that before he's body kick guys
*  Stands up and body kicks him in Hawaii, bro
*  I got into a I got to argument with a ref because one of our fighters like body kicked someone was down
*  And he stopped the like they stopped the fight to give the kid a time and there's I was like what are you doing?
*  He's like you can't body kick on the girls like you cannot body kick
*  I down a point to the head you can body kick you can kick him to the body
*  You just can't get him to the head. Yeah, I know you can't do that
*  What are you watching?
*  Unless they modified the rules. Nah, brother moves as a modified bro. I was just bad. Yeah
*  I was got a fucking point deducted from my from my from my one of my boys. I was like, I'm so sorry, bro
*  But like that that was supposed to be a TKO. Yeah, you do you take you with this kid, bro. That's ridiculous
*  That's just bad referee
*  I really think that the problem the only problem with knees to the head on the ground and kicks to the ground is the cage
*  If there was no cage no place where you couldn't move and someone could stomp you all that shit should be on the table
*  Because it it's these are valid techniques if you can knee someone to the head in the clinch if you could scissor knee
*  Someone like but hated it with Michael Itis
*  If you could do that kind of shit like why can't you need a guy to head on the ground?
*  And you know what it is, bro
*  And and if you if you do do that
*  You know how much more of this like this safe area of people's playing with their hand the ground hand up
*  You know how much more it people want to do that?
*  They're gonna go all the way to the ground or they're gonna like fight you talented
*  Intelligently, yeah, and then they're gonna go instead of going down and playing that day game, bro
*  Yeah, they having a moment where you're safer because of a rule is never a good thing. No
*  The whole way you've compete yeah, you will you'll do that
*  You'll let a guy have your back and put your hand on the ground
*  You know his knees right there and when in reality you got to get out of that spot
*  Yeah, you can't you can't hear ya dead same thing with being a turtle
*  Yeah, if you're a turtle and a guy's like like Mark Coleman and pride can just drop those knees on your head
*  Remember they let him do that. Yeah, so when guys turtle in the UFC you cannot need them in the head
*  Yeah, which is a perfect time to need them in the head
*  But then even that cuz then when they do turtle right so say I'm fighting someone and I see someone turtle
*  It's like half a second of them resting because I'm thinking like shit now
*  I got to be smarter where I'm picking this and what I'm doing exactly the back of the head rule
*  100% you know but like if I can soccer kick you cuz you're doing that like that
*  It's so easy to like bobo see down there. I kick you right in your head
*  Yeah, like but I don't know bro if you know that that's one of the options you won't stay in that position
*  Yeah, the guy's not gonna be turtle
*  But I guess even like guys are like taking knees knees down and they're like this on their ground already
*  It's like they know what they're doing exactly you know what you're doing
*  But I still and then if I come in and do something wrong you get a take down and you're on top now, right?
*  I'm on well like that's the same one side so mad at aljimane when aljimane won the title from pure to yarn
*  Pure to hit someone an illegal knee when he's down, but that Lee that knee should be legal
*  Yeah, I shouldn't be able to be on your knees in a fight
*  Yeah, I think so you're are you able to move if they're not stopping the fight
*  That means you can move even with the even with the even with what you said you you you pulling at the elbow
*  Did the 12 to 6? Yeah? I'm like brother they do you I didn't I never know why they took it out, right?
*  And then you you said I think someone into his long time ago
*  You said they took it out because they saw a guy break ice with that doing that right break bricks on
*  Right 12 in the morning. Yeah, guess what?
*  That guy can break a brick with a headbutt that guy can break a brick with training elbow this way
*  Yeah, that guy can break a bricks train the elbow upwards. I guess so we can still throw that thing
*  It's so what why are you thinking that away from on the ground big John McCarthy told me that it was just the people at?
*  the athletic Commission's back of it well, you know big John had this
*  unenviable role where he had to go to these places and
*  Explained to them that there's rules involved in MMA and then you get morons like what about this?
*  I saw someone do that and break a break. You can't do that. Okay, no 12 to 6 elbows. That's crazy
*  Okay, it was a dumbass rule and that the only loss on John Jones record
*  And even that like you and I'm on my back the 12 to 6 follow you right so I can't go like this
*  Crazy and then they're like, yeah, but you can't go like this. But if you go like this
*  Oh, that's the same exact. This is the same exact thing. It's so
*  Also, it's like especially this elbow, I don't feel like this elbow is as hard as this no way, but this is not like
*  Even if I'm mounting you right like John Jones mounted right? Mm-hmm
*  What you gotta do you gotta like crunch your abs like to get all here this is like I'm going
*  Shoulder yes
*  Bodies coming into yes
*  There's so much more in that one and you you can't have a thing where a guy can protect himself by doing that and then you
*  Can't throw that one technique. That's crazy. That's crazy. That doesn't make any
*  There's a bunch of dumb rules like that, but I think the cage
*  Provides this problem for soccer kicks and stomps and yeah, cuz you're stuck. It's like a wall, right? Yeah, it's like a wall, right?
*  And I understand that but guess what?
*  Don't go to the fucking cake
*  You know the game there brother, you know
*  I mean like I I throw the cage in my buddy
*  Maybe I have a rule where they say like no knees or stomps when a fighter's touching the cage
*  Yeah, that'd be cool. Like if yes, but then you can start seeing guys if in the middle
*  Crawling their ass all the way to the cage now, you know, right, right. That's true
*  Well people are always gonna try to see yeah
*  I think as you as soon as you get a as soon as you get a damn rule people are gonna game it all the time
*  And that's what I thought my thought they should have a basketball court
*  My thought just guys should fight in the center of like an open flat place just like
*  But just what they do for even for grappling matches, yeah, but guys are gonna fall over and then what's gonna happen
*  Well, they don't have multiple matches going on like they do with with that don't have it on a platform just have it on the ground
*  Oh, yeah
*  Like have guys I mean, you know while that would be we're all sitting there in the arena and there's no cage and these dudes
*  Just walk out in the center of this big open mat. I
*  Mean, that'd be crazy. Yeah, just have a warning because then I I love the cage, bro
*  I love no cage to I just love the kids for takedown purposes, right?
*  Whenever somebody put me like go to the cage cage is your friend
*  A lot of guys don't like it because you think you're losing the fight but like
*  But it'll be no kid. You'd be smart though, because yeah what you said, I see what you're saying
*  but you would see so much guy but so much guys is gonna like
*  Get you to a point and they're gonna shoot so like, you know
*  Like the islam's and the kabebs that kind of fights that they're gonna shoot so low cuz you know have a cage
*  right, it's gonna keep driving you to
*  Forever land, you know until you get hit and then you got to restart or whatever
*  But it might stop a lot of takedowns because it's gonna it's gonna have a much more realistic
*  Scenario instead of being able to charge up to a guy against the cage get your hands up against his butt lift him
*  And take him down where he can't he can't go anywhere his backs to get to cage
*  It could be took so many guys down off the cage. Yeah, so many guys do that
*  Yeah, I'm off the cage
*  Yeah
*  And if you got a guy who's gonna keep moving and push you away and keep moving that circle out now
*  You got to take him down again, it could change the whole dynamic of fighting good it could I getting up
*  I can see way harder. I can yeah, it's gonna be way harder. I love the keys for get ups
*  I have another thought about that. Yeah, I think if a guy takes you down at the end of the round you start in that
*  Same position from round two you think so
*  I'd be pretty gangster cuz guys wouldn't be able to guys wouldn't care, you know, some guys just take it off
*  They got whatever take me down. I'm only gonna be stand up anyway
*  Well, you got to think it's a fight or or or like even your rule
*  Like if you're getting hold down from that last round then you start from getting cold down, right? Yeah, that's the same rule, right?
*  That's what I think if like say if a guy takes you down and he's got you mounted and it's the end of the first round
*  I feel like you start mounted in the second round. That sounds crazy. It sounds like you should start a fighting
*  It is a fight, right? It's a fight. It's not five individual fights
*  Yeah, so if you have a five round fight and every fight starts standing up for a guy like Paheta. That's a massive advantage
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, especially after imagine he got took it on it and it just took his ass beaten for one round
*  You know imagine Paheta fights John Jones and they fight John Jones for the light heavyweight title at at
*  You know five rounds John takes Paheta down in the first round and at the end of the round John's got him mounted and Paheta
*  Rides out the bell
*  Well, the round starts round two with John Jones mounting him because it's one fight. It's not five fights
*  So if you start a new fight now, you're starting standing up again, but you didn't you're not standing up
*  Yeah fight is still going on. That's crazy
*  But then they're in the same spot then they don't have to change the whole judging to to to the whole fight like judging
*  Oh, yeah, it should be I feel like it should be that way like yeah, why are we fighting rounds?
*  You know, I think pride had it right. Yeah pride had it, right?
*  They judged the fight as a whole and they judged the end of the fight. It was more important
*  Yeah, who's winning?
*  Yeah, if you are out boxing a guy and there's no teachers around and then you know
*  All of a sudden he takes you down and he starts beating your ass and you can't get up and then the ref
*  Are those teachers come and pull him off? Everybody's gonna think that guy won the fight. Yeah, they're not gonna say yeah
*  Tom controlled him on the feet for three minutes. He only took him down for 30 seconds
*  Nobody gives a shit about that. Yeah, they give a shit about like who's winning at the end of the fight exactly
*  That'd be I mean you it's kind of cheat, you know
*  It favoritism my ass that we stand on the feet every time but that's pretty that's pretty cool
*  Yeah, that would be pretty cool because now you would see guys you would see guys fight much harder to get up now, right?
*  So like if I'm on my ground, I'm on my back, right and the round like you see guys like oh 30 seconds
*  Well, it's the best I mean like I just hold on to you for 30 seconds
*  Now cuz I know in my mind like oh I'm standing up but we're gonna we're gonna come on standing
*  But if if you tell me 30 seconds and holy shit new wrong, I'm gonna start on my back
*  I need to fucking get up and I need to like create a scramble or something, you know
*  So it's not so indefinite that we start here. I think I brought I think it changes me. I think that's pretty cool
*  Maybe I like the idea and what I like the idea about it cuz it's much more like a real fight
*  So this is supposed to be the fight the sport of real fighting, right?
*  That's really what it is. Like what works the best?
*  That's what MMA is and if you have limited techniques like you can't use a knee to a downed opponent
*  You can't do this to a down opponent
*  Well that that fucks things up and then if you have the cage where the guy can use the cage
*  That fucks things up because the guy could use the cage to take guys down they could use the cage to stand back up
*  So the cage becomes a factor and then you have the fact that every round starts standing up
*  So if you you busted your ass to take this guy down
*  Yeah, you took damage to get a hold of this guy you take it on the first run
*  You have ten seconds to go in the first round you mount him. You're on top of them
*  Horn blows fuck now you gotta start standing. I gotta take him down. Yeah, imagine is it's chill
*  Against that Anderson fight if he could have came back from the ground every time crazy change that it changes
*  He could have got triangle sooner
*  Or he could have finished the guy, you know, you don't know, you know, this is a bunch of what-ifs
*  But it's a bunch of what-ifs, you know, it's also taken into consideration that it is supposed to be one fight
*  It's not supposed to be five fights
*  You know and like to have every fight start in the advantageous position for the striker when he didn't earn a get-up
*  Yeah, yeah after getting yet. No, I mean we do it
*  They already kind of do that right like when you're against the cage or something or something happened and they break you
*  Mm-hmm. They put you right back into that situation. So why would I?
*  Fuck it suck for strikers, you know strikers worldwide
*  I'm sorry, but if this is the way to prove that you're the baddest man alive
*  Sign me up for it brother cuz I'm here for if you take my ass down and and and and I use a I use a bell
*  To get a spec to stand up. That's kind of lame bro. We like you need to get your ass up, you know
*  You're not you're not considered
*  able to get your ass up in a fight that you would have lost under the current rules because you might start standing up in the
*  Second round and this dude says all right, fuck this guy. I'm not gonna clinch with him now. I'm gonna kick his calves
*  I'm gonna move around you need to talk to somebody like I'd be pretty cool. Nobody listens to me
*  Maybe you see 400 they do something. Well, I had all sorts of plans that they don't listen to me
*  And I wouldn't listen to me either there. They've got a great business. Yeah, well successful. You can't make all these changes
*  That's ridiculous
*  My other thing that I would say is you got to get rid of weight cutting and you can do it
*  It could be done with hydration tests and you got to give people more options for weight classes
*  They should have an option every 10 pounds minimum every 10 pounds would be I think every with the weight cutting would be would be fun
*  Well, I don't know we cutting but then we see guys like other promotions and people are missing the hydration test anyway
*  So like people are still trying to do they're just they're gonna get whatever you do
*  They're gonna gain it because somebody always is gonna look for the advantage no matter what it is
*  But there's a way to do it where if you have a big organization like the UFC look think about what they do with
*  Drug fees drug-free sport now used to be you saw that they'll find you wherever you are and give you a random drug test
*  Well, why can't they find you and put you on a fucking scale and hide and make get a hydration?
*  Read on you and go make sure yeah, you're 172 pounds. Yeah, like you're not 145 pounds max. Yeah, you're 172 pound fighter
*  So we're gonna you could probably healthy be healthy and fully hydrated 165. That's probably where you should fight
*  Unless you want to do something crazy to lose a lot like actually lose a lot of weight like go running every day
*  It's funny cuz then a lot of people always ask me or even when I started dating my wife first
*  She's like she went she's like, oh you're that heavy. Why do you find this?
*  I'm like, I only do it cuz everybody else is doing this shit
*  You know if we don't do it if I don't do it then I'll fight one seven year
*  You know, I go imagine my ass stepping in there fighting like like a hose it not a hose it but like a George St
*  Pierre right?
*  Tomorrow you know me Leon is a big boy. Yeah, so it's like it's like we everybody's do it cuz everyone's doing exactly
*  They have to do it cuz you but all those guys are 200 pounds all those ones. Yeah
*  Yeah, they're all those guys like Hums. That's gigantic
*  Hums eyes 91 70 anymore. No, yeah
*  You need 170 remember
*  Well, he's big. That's why I wonder if he could have made it when
*  New York pulled his card because the thing about New York is there they've done stuff like that before like they wouldn't let you
*  Khabib yeah, now I quit it took your place. Yeah, I'm telling you but
*  That's unreal unfortunate, but I could have made that weight though about 100%
*  Yeah, but the thing is it was just it was just stupidity
*  You know, it's ten days. I was with some somebody doing
*  My my nutrition stuff at the end. He did a freaking interview
*  He said how much I was I was super heavy and the freaking Commission saw it and they fucking was on my ass
*  I was like bro, if you didn't say shit, we would have been fine, you know, right, but then that's what happened
*  Yeah, you open people open your mouth. I love like a tight-knit small small team, you know, it's like nothing happens
*  Nothing gets out anything happens. Just like motherfucker
*  Can't say that yeah, especially New York you could say in Vegas in New York
*  Yeah, Vegas don't give a shit and it was also in New York when they just started like they didn't they did it
*  That's what I say. They when you New York was stood against MMA. Mm-hmm
*  like they still was against MMA, you know, and then
*  That happened and yeah, I remember bro fucking guy came in. I
*  Looked I looked sucked out of my life and they was like, yeah, you're not fine. How heavy were you?
*  How much I was like three pounds off bro, that's it
*  Yeah, and we and we had like a bud like we had like I still I still think we had like
*  three hours left
*  You could yeah, it was fine. You know, I think Hums out they pulled him
*  I don't know what he was when they pulled him then he started drinking water and then he waited 178
*  I believe that's crazy. Yeah, he was way over that's crazy. Yeah, but I
*  Wasn't excited about that fight who's he funny ideas Oh
*  Nate yeah, I was like that is a
*  Then what happened who did he fight? He fought somebody else, right?
*  Nate fought Tony Ferguson. Yeah, and he fought Kevin Holland. Yeah. Yeah, which is also Kevin Holland was preparing for someone else
*  Yeah, yeah, they turn the fire Rodriguez. Who's a striker and then also he's fighting this insane wrestler
*  Yeah, and then that's what happened with the with the fake glove touch and he took him down. Yeah. Yeah
*  Hums, that is who's he fighting next?
*  We're it occur
*  Robert that's right Robert. I'm looking forward to now
*  If there if there is someone who can who can kind of neglect the wrestling, I think it's Whitaker
*  Yeah, I think it's Whitaker bro and then
*  Comes out is strong
*  but oh that that that that burns fight like showed a lot like it showed a lot like if you can hit this guy and
*  Continue to hit him. It's gonna be a fun fight and tomorrow Usman fight because tomorrow was winning the third round, bro
*  And he had ten days. Yeah
*  And when I tell everybody like against a Cosmo, you know, like what a Cosmo with the wrestling
*  It's like if you go if you go pull up if you pull up his fight brother
*  If you go watch the Cosmo fight gets Usman
*  The only time he he takes out Usman is when Usman wrestles him back when Usman is like anti wrestling
*  Fighting his wrist not letting him connect his hands. No takedowns, but as soon as Usman was like, okay
*  I'm just gonna wrestle back and like he starts to like grab the stomach and stuff
*  You get taken down you pick it up like brother like you should just anti-wrestle this guy
*  You just beat him in the striking too, but I think it was also tomorrow didn't know what his cardio was like
*  Yeah, so he had to get
*  It just wasn't prepared to go full out and hums on knew that so hums not put that grappling pressure on him immediately
*  Try to wear him out. Yeah
*  Crazy, I don't like those ten day fights man. It's got it. It's shitty cuz no one's gonna talk about the ten days
*  You know, I mean like unless you Tom Aspinall
*  Yeah, right so Tom Aspinall takes it on like 11 days and he knocks out Pavlovich and he becomes the interim title exactly
*  But but then even even with that like this can say the interim, you know, he's right
*  He won the interim. They're not even talking about the day everybody would bring up the tent
*  You know like even with like the Vogue fight you say oh, yeah, Vogue is this the Vogue is that but then oh
*  He got knocked off on this guy and then he got knocked out again
*  I'm like, yeah, but he got knocked on on 10 days, but it's crazy
*  You know, it's like people keep forgetting about that cuz they don't give a shit
*  Also because if you go back before that second fight with Islam Vogue is considered to be the number one pound-for-pound guy in the world
*  And many believe that they thought he won the fight. Yeah, I mean
*  I thought it was real close, but I watched it like three or four times
*  I'm like, I think there was like one round where you you I think it's a second round where it's up in the air
*  You like I think but again at the end of the fight, he's on top of Islam and he's pounding on
*  Just nuts to see crazy
*  To think a 45er who is gonna come up and do that to the guy who does that to everybody in his weight class
*  Yeah, it was insane bro. He's a legend bro. He's a legend brother
*  That's why it's like sucks to take a 10-day fight and then you get KO'd one of the worst ways to get KO'd
*  Brother and then and then I'm in the back. I'm in the back
*  I don't know if you guys saw this clip, but I'm in the back and and
*  Usd is doing this promo thing right after the I think so was no and I after was before I don't know
*  It's before one of the fights
*  But they're doing it promos late when I was warming up and I was watching the fights
*  They did this clip and they're showing like all the old clips problem. They show vogue walking out
*  Yeah, and then the next clip is side by side and he getting knocked out by two guys. I was like what the fuck
*  I was like damn this game sucks
*  What a shitty turn of events
*  Oh look bulk and in the fucking next two clip is side by side of him
*  He's only two is two knockout losses and I'm like wow
*  This shit is harmless brother's gaming for a week. No, it's hard game is not for the week
*  It's heartless how quickly your life can turn around if you're a guy like bulk you go from being the man to being dismissed
*  Uh-huh, you know to being like oh, we're gonna fight but like cuz like you Leah didn't want a grand of a rematch
*  He didn't want to fight nobody in the top fucking 15 brother. Who does he want to fight brother himself?
*  What the fuck I'm gonna play himself bro, what the hell is going on but this guy this guy brother
*  This is the man bro. This is this is the guy we're dealing with bro
*  This is the guy we're dealing with so we had a we had a Bible verse off on Twitter
*  Everybody's like saying freaking 10-8 Holloway cuz the verse I use against them and then um, and then he writes an I don't say nothing
*  That's all I said and he writes like a freaking
*  Paragraph bro to me like I didn't even read that's how long it was
*  He writes a paragraph to me brother, I didn't read it he and I was just tripping out
*  I was like it was like an angry girlfriend text, you know, like my wife don't even text me like that
*  So I was like I read the first to say I'm not reading this
*  Brother I don't know what's going on, but I was like I read the first student and then I saw you had to scrolls
*  I what the yeah, did I make my wife mad? I had to make sure that was a hurry, you know, what the hell?
*  That's hilarious that's funny
*  Yeah, I don't know who he wants to fight next
*  But I mean if I guess he feels like he's a champ he can call the shots
*  But I know that he turned down the perf one the 305 the Volkanovsky rematch. Oh, yeah
*  yeah, the thing the question is like if you're in Volkanovsky's corner, let's say this now because
*  We can say it now, right because we couldn't say it after the first
*  Islam fight but you take a fight like the Islam fight you get KO'd bad head kick
*  And yeah
*  Cuz then cuz then I was like telling Tim damn like brother like if you need somebody let me know like
*  Like tell you see that no and you see came back and say like this crazy mother ever wants to fight
*  You know, I mean, so I think so
*  I think this is him and his team and even with his team like even with um, but he's such a property
*  Yeah, he's so important. Yeah to risk him like that again after a head kick knockout to my chef
*  Yeah, and then and then like you can mentally
*  Or and physically say you're ready, right? But then something wasn't right, you know, like go watch
*  They you know, this guy's a rugby player, you know
*  I played him three times and this guy's head is always headfirst
*  Like he's always like I fought him three times brother and like he like it's accidental. It's not hard
*  But he's like he's like a rugby guy. So his head is always coming in
*  You know, like like we always mean him like headbutted a couple times
*  It is a name not big ones not like career chaining ones, but it's just his head is forward. He's a rugby guy
*  In that huddle shit, right? Tell me why when he fights this fight
*  he's like being uncharacteristic and like kind of throwing and then going back, you know, so it's like
*  It was just a different, you know, I don't want to I'm not taking it's compromise
*  Yeah, I'm not taking nothing away from me. Like it is what it is
*  He fought he fought bulk at a perfect time
*  But like if you can like if somebody can look me in the eyes then I then be like bro
*  That was the same bulk that that that's been you know doing this thing at 45, right?
*  I will call you dead-ass liar brother
*  I'll be like you're a serial killer because you're a psychopath if you think that's the same man you you you get
*  Compromised by knockouts. There's no if-and-swear butts about it. The question is how much time do you give yourself to recovery?
*  And can you get back to 100%?
*  I don't think you can get back to 100% from a head kick knockout in a few months
*  No, bro, and you have to do some sparring to get ready for and that can't be they say nothing
*  And yeah, and and say kickboxing is great
*  Eugene is is a great coach Eugene's a genius and and I'm sure Eugene was probably in his year
*  You know, I mean Italian him but then again, it's just well
*  He's a dominator. He knows how to win and you know, he but you can't run a race with a bad suspension
*  Yeah, you know, you know, let that thing heal up and and but then sometimes you just you're your own enemy
*  You know, I mean like he probably wanted that erased in his mind
*  Thinking that like this nod I'm gonna come back here I'm gonna do this and this is just gonna be forgotten
*  But it just happens cuz then what if he goes out there and he did get it done
*  You know, I mean that that that would have been amazing right and we all would have been wrong
*  but then
*  For head injury rise like I could sit earlier in our conversation with Justin like Justin's taking six months off of that
*  you know, I mean like
*  Bro like six months at least no contact this chill
*  But like this guy like you you probably got a good freakin nice payday for that second Islam fight
*  Even the first is long fight, you know, so you do you know you do you know you do favors for you to see it
*  They carry you you know at the end of the day. I've been with this company coming for a real long time
*  So I know this stuff. So it's like
*  He should I I feel like selfishly he should just rest. I feel like you have to protect you have to protect
*  And not even not even as a fighter bro like as a person like, you know
*  I shared the octagon this guy I'd like to call him my freaking March nemesis people like to make things
*  But I like him as a person brother. He's a father to beautiful daughters, and I mean he got a family
*  So like bro, just take your time off, you know, enjoy go go go with them do that, you know, and it happens though
*  Sometimes sometimes uh, we are our own worst enemies
*  You know, I mean like and being in his shoes
*  I couldn't say because if that happened to me, I would want to be like that like this
*  I want to kill this kid. Let me just get and remind people and then
*  People close to you that can stop that
*  Any any does bro, but like at the end of day is just maybe he just trumped him
*  He was like maybe maybe he had a trump card and he was like look I listened to you guys before
*  But trust me I got this and like how do you not believe a guy in like like him?
*  You know, he had an iron chin before that. Oh, yeah iron chin
*  You see his size his head brother
*  He takes a shot brother, but the fact that toporia put him out with one shot
*  Yeah, part of me was like damn and absolutely toporia is a knockout striker. He has beautiful boxing beautiful
*  His technique is outstanding his power is tremendous. No doubt about it. He can knock anybody out, but it's the way it happened and that
*  That the shying away that we were talking about earlier was perfect shot
*  Yeah, he put his head down yeah, he knew he said it's gonna be there put his head down
*  Yeah, swing to it and that's what the boy does but he swings when he swings he swings all his might and it's nice technique
*  It's not like wild swinging on his might. He's swinging all his might
*  Technique wise knowing that like analyzing like your head is probably gonna be here
*  I'm just gonna throw the toe, you know, the Jai Herbert one was amazing. Yeah, that was that was one after the head kick
*  He knocked him out in the second round to come back after and that's one
*  Yeah, you know he's a small 155 yeah, it's not the really the weight class for 45
*  Perfect, but it's just I mean he could fight at 55 to make no mistake about it
*  Just like you did go up correctly, but I Herbert is a long tall dude. Yeah, he's long
*  I do I feel like for a fighter like Alexander Volkonovsky. He's like a legacy
*  Fighter he's a guy that's like he's a legend
*  He's one of the most dominant champions in any division and
*  For a guy like that, you gotta kind of know the mindset but not don't let him do something
*  Don't take a war right take a fight with my chef on ten days notice when you haven't been training
*  You just been drinking drinking. Yeah and hanging out
*  I know you think you can do it and maybe you can do it
*  but you probably yeah should not be a hundred percent and that and that's the
*  And that's a tough thing you know it's like I hate when like you know he said that and then things happen and then they
*  Talk about what's going on. It's like brother like
*  Skip the man is do you know you took the fight? You know what you did?
*  What a hell of what a hell I gotta tell you what I was doing this whole time
*  You know like at the end of day. I was like well. He's just a better night. You know I
*  Would a lot of fighters like the most irritating thing there's two things that irritate me about fighters, bro
*  Sore losers and in sore winners brought like people that win and stood talk like oh this this and this I'm like you
*  Want the damn fight so what like why you telling us all this shit?
*  You know like I hate guys who do that so and I and I hate that's like I'm whenever you you see me lose
*  Or you see me win, but I give nothing but respect to the next guy because I don't know what they've been going through I don't
*  know
*  What kind of obstacles they had to do because I know what I'll be excited to I'm not gonna say shit
*  But if you want to say stuff like even Justin like Justin anything, but he's finally doing
*  He's doing all kind of media now, and he's the same acts of dog. You know congrats to him
*  You know I'd yeah, we went out there a fight like even with him people trying to be like oh you lost your title shot
*  Like how do you feel like I don't care. That's a BM. That's a BMF Justin is wired different
*  Yeah, we were different. You know I mean like a lot of us fighters like even people tell me why you doing this problem
*  Why are different, but I want to fight the best guys. You know that's just it
*  I want to fight the best guys in the world if you guys think this is the best guy
*  Why you think I've been calling DC's badass out for so long
*  He's the best guy brother. I fight him and DC and then DC had the audacity fight week to tell me if he made 45
*  I was brother you make 45. I'm killing you right now. It's a fight, but DC you try to make 45
*  I'm going to kill you brother, but right now. It's a fair fight because you're so heavy
*  You know chop both his legs off. I still wouldn't make 45. He would have to do so much, but he looked like mr.
*  Potato head can you pull your body apart like mr. Potato? I think DC could have made 85
*  I think he could have yeah when he was 205. Yeah, I think I think he could have yeah
*  If he really wanted to but he loved food, I know imagine that guy at 85 good Lord
*  Oh my gosh, good. That'd be his that'd be his normal weight class
*  He'd actually be the height wise of people at 85ers. I mean there there is some toy 85ers
*  Don't get me wrong, but he oh him and heavyweight brother. He's like I know he gets dwarfed. It's crazy brother
*  He's the he's dwarf that's insane that he fought it every way
*  One one and he knocked out steep a steep it the
*  Heavyweight goat that people consider he knocked them out bro crazy crazy crazy
*  You know then you see the second fight. He's really not a heavyweight. Yeah, I've seen the third fight like it's not it's not right
*  Yeah, yeah, you can tell right he just he just he just loves to eat, but he's a Louisiana boy brother
*  He loves those he loves those little there
*  They're freaking when they make their pots their crab oils and stuff
*  It's gonna be interesting though to see someone at 85 that's that caliber of wrestler like so someone who's of a DC caliber of wrestling
*  Does rise up through the Olympic ranks and then gets into the 185 pound division and has the same kind of punching power
*  Is there anyone that that is there not that weight class not in the UFC?
*  No, is there some real good wrestlers like Johnny Eblen is really good like a like a like a Olympic wrestler too
*  He's that caliber he was that caliber but Bo nickel, you know, he'll tell you he's got a lot of work to do
*  Yeah, he was very upset with his last fight. Oh, yeah crazy. I saw that
*  But you know Cody Brunch is good and he gave him some troubles and yeah, he gave him some trouble standing up
*  You know, he's gonna have a real hard time with the elite strikers at that weight class if they have good takedown defense
*  But his wrestling is a far above and beyond most people in that division
*  But then that's the but that's the beauty of our sport, right?
*  That is the beauty of us
*  But I never did any type of wrestling and I feel like I could wrestle with the best of them in an MMA fight
*  Yeah, I mean I'm even crazy enough to be like brago wrestle you had to wrestle practice. I don't give a shit
*  You know, what was the worst you gonna do? You're gonna ragdoll me? Okay, perfect
*  Yeah, that's what you supposed to do
*  But what happens when you don't and I make it a wrestling and you're like, holy fuck
*  This guy's actually pretty good, you know, so at the end of the day, that's why you just gotta be great
*  I love MMA bro and one punch one kick one knee one elbow one takedown
*  You know I mean like even take down like how much time you take someone down you show the land in their stomach change the whole
*  Fight. Oh, oh, oh, you're breathing hard brother. What's going on there? You know, you just you start laying on guys
*  It's uh, that's why MMA is a beautiful bro. You don't know what is going on
*  You know what's gonna go on and it's it's so many different things can happen
*  How about that? John weight Lee yon Shao non fight? Oh crazy, but we watching in the back
*  They're good bro
*  when yon Shao non decided not to tap and went out and then woke up at the end of the first round like when the
*  Bell rang and John way Lee let's go over and she's like what's happening?
*  And she goes right back to her corner and like is that legal she's out. She was out cold
*  Man, bro. She was out cold. Can we see that clip? Yeah
*  She was out cold, but that's that's insane, right? She wouldn't tap that's insane
*  I just saw I just saw a lot of like I didn't see that part
*  But then I saw like the second maybe the third round and on and like it was bad. Oh, they were battling
*  It was a crazy fight man. Yon Shao non is a beast. She's good bad
*  She's good. She's so gangster the fact she wouldn't tap fully locked in
*  But I think she'll goes to sleep these guys is like I don't dishonor my family, bro
*  They next level bro. They're these guys are they're they're warriors
*  People don't understand they get a lot of these other out-of-country fighters, bro
*  They're insane, bro
*  It's in it's insane when you see an outside fight like a out-of-country fighter quit
*  Cuz a lot of them don't they come from almost like you know like Charles and to come from the slums and China to come
*  From places where it's like you must get bred into being a fighter. You know, it's like this is what you're gonna do
*  This is it. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah crazy
*  Crazy bro, apparently fought that fight with like a broken foot or something is something wrong with him this last fight
*  Yeah, I'm not sure with Wonder Boy. That's why I took him down. So yeah. Yeah, bro. Yeah that guy bro
*  Oh my god, he's he couldn't strike cuz he had something wrong or even when he fought Neil. Yeah, bro
*  What is his name? What is Jeff? Yeah, Jeff Neil, bro
*  I think he's a who does that to him, but you know how strong gotta be to do that to Jeff Jeff Neil
*  Jeff Neil's 200 pounds that night they say
*  30 pounds bro. Yeah. Yeah. Oh shit, bro. That guy is weird strong, bro. They just I know it doesn't look it
*  No, that's no, but to squeeze someone's neck off like that standing standing. That's like one hook in that was like a
*  That's almost like a bully like a bully. So I got you say uncle, you know, like that's crazy
*  Yeah, that's insane. They might I was looking at it that way like that is insane and how you do it to Neil
*  Neil is a tough son of a gun bro. He punches hard and he landed hard shots and
*  Okay
*  No, I choke you. It's a wild time for talent. There's so many guys brother and and you know, it is cool
*  It's it's a wild time for talent and it's it's in every weight class
*  You know like how certain weight classes like ah, yeah, they got you know this and that whatever
*  But it's like in almost every weight class. So here it is. This is the end of the round. So yawn shall not is
*  Fully out here. Oh, yeah, John. Well, he's got look at it's a perfect rear naked
*  She's fully out like out cold right now bell rings
*  Let's her go out cold
*  Lucky she woke up look at like man. She don't know what the fuck's going on. Whoa. I did not know that
*  Yeah, she was out out. So if you watch the
*  Dead she's dead like 12 seconds. Yeah, if you watch the road, I mean that is a fully locked look at that
*  Seven seconds to go look at the palm placement. Yeah the back of the head. I mean she's doing it perfectly five seconds right there
*  She's out out. So look at her hands are completely limp
*  So she's out and
*  The referee puts his hands on her
*  She gets up
*  And she's like what what's going on?
*  She literally doesn't know where she's going to the death to the death to the death to the death. Yeah, whoo
*  whoo
*  Brother imagine you gotta fight someone like that. That's next level. Well, that's a BMF
*  Yeah, you know, it's wild about that BMF when somebody acts Dana Dana was like, uh, it's like a what about the BMF
*  Are you gonna make it for girls and Dana was like the BMF is forever. I was like, wait, what the fuck?
*  I was like what they say? Yeah, exactly. He's like anybody can fight for the BMF. I was like
*  What does that mean? Can't be telling me?
*  Is gonna try to challenge you
*  I
*  Can't be saying that shit down what that is. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Don't say that
*  Don't say that. Yeah, that's crazy. They might have a female BMF one day. I should brought there
*  Oh, well, he's up there. Yeah, John is up there. You can't be a motherfucker for your girl. Oh
*  You call the BDF?
*  Well, I guess you could if it's a lesbian wins it oh my god, you know there I guess yeah, yeah, you're not
*  I mean, what are we saying? Yeah, I mean obviously a motherfucker is a different thing
*  But if you didn't understand our language and you said the baddest motherfucker like what they're looking at you
*  What is this? All right other countries that like have to translate the BMF. They're like, what are they saying? Yeah
*  brought it bro, I
*  Forgot was fighting for the BMF to you know when when when proof is I never ever got an end-new brother
*  I don't know if you're I I think I told you before and never got an end-new
*  Yeah
*  So when I won the when I won the interim title, right it was like and now
*  So when I beat Pettis and then when I fought although it was and now again
*  I was like, oh you owe me an end-new so I never
*  Gave Bruce like a hard time about it and then I got my end-new now
*  But I was tripping out when I was going there and I was like in there waiting
*  I was like fuck is proof taking so long. They not to see the knockout, but I want to say I want
*  I get my hand raised and then he was like
*  I was like, oh shit. Yeah, I was like, oh, yeah finally got it
*  But we need an undisputed and new so so are you in a holding pattern now?
*  How does it work like in terms of what what happens for you in the future? We see what happens man?
*  We see what happens. I mean where so you see what happens in New Jersey. Yeah. Yeah, we see what happened in New Jersey
*  We I I couldn't tell you to be honest
*  I all I know is they know I put my ass after fighting big brother things are about to change so I'm waiting
*  I'm waiting for the change Dana. Let us know let us we be we be sitting we're waiting right now
*  They gave me like a 30-day no contact, you know, like the normal thing that they do after a fight
*  I like people don't know that everybody's like what does it mean 30 days? Are you okay?
*  I'm like brother. This is just this is just regular stuff that we got to rest after a fight
*  So I got I'm doing that right now me and Tim didn't hit us about anything really, you know
*  Like I said, Ilya writing paragraphs over to us on Twitter
*  That's what did he say? Can I see what he said? I didn't know what he said. I want to see what he says
*  I don't even think you're gonna reach you the whole thing
*  You might read half of it and just stop reading
*  He's an interesting guy says he gets drunk the week of the fight like the night before the weigh-ins
*  I saw that he drinks drinks wine drinks wine. Does he get a buzz you relax?
*  Because if it works, he never missed late. So no, I mean, I guess you could do it
*  Dehydrating yourself to make weight is horrible for you. Yeah, you're already doing that. I don't think
*  Whether I finish you by KO or submission, I just beat the guy that beat I was doing math
*  Not one exactly twice, but three times, you know
*  I have one thing that keeps you relevant and that would grant you a money fight the BMF belt
*  I no longer fight for money, but for legacy already
*  Is already fighting for a legacy no longer fighting for money, brother
*  He got gifted after and Martin or something that I saw somebody told me
*  While holding my title will cement me as the first the first to hold both belts the first to knock out bulk and what?
*  Most certainly will happen when we fight the first one to put you to sleep
*  Something to calm you down is this God doesn't shame anyone. You will have a worthy defeat against a champ
*  Wow, this is like Roman shit. You'll have a worthy worthy defeat against a champion who will be remembered for eternity
*  I decide who when and where if you don't like the terms, I'm sure or Ortega will oblige
*  How you are you calling our table right right now? How's our table like?
*  Even ranked in the way he just beat that year, right?
*  But then he was like away for like three years and he I even see him calling for a shot. I'm like, yeah
*  He's one fight against a year. Yeah, you're just lost against bulk. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah years wild
*  I love watch that dude fight like that guy kicks like nobody else in the sport brother if he if they're like jabs brother he can
*  There's like a switch bro. If he flips it he's gonna be like way more like he's a scary dude already
*  Mm-hmm, but there's a there's a switch that he just needs to flip it and he's gonna start figuring out and like it's gonna be problem
*  He's caught a problem, but when I walk away, you know, it's funny cuz when I fought him I
*  Think that was the best year that anybody ever saw when we found the apex
*  I think so there's fighters that I feel like when you go in front of a crowd
*  They they're not fighting to a full capacity and then there's some fighters when you fight apex where it's like in the gym
*  They just gonna shine, you know
*  And like yeah year is like when we fought there and I hit him with couple shots and before like you'd seem get hit
*  couple shots in different fights and kind of like weather away and be like
*  Oh, yeah, whatever and like the fight this, you know
*  Kind of like get in there and then almost like gets finished because of the fights not going his way or whatever
*  Right and I was hitting with some shots and I was just thinking in there like what are you doing?
*  Like why are we making this so much harder? You know, you're making this fight so hard
*  I don't think I have to take his ass down. I was like, what are we doing here, brother?
*  Why what where the hell did this fucking superhero? Yeah, you're come out of you know, but uh, well you gotta remember
*  Year you go back to the Frankie Edgar fight, right?
*  So yeah, you're gets dominated by Frankie Edgar on the ground and then you get your 2.0
*  After that and is much better take down defense really good at submitting guys off his back
*  It's just like more of these fights. He's still a young guy. He's young. Yeah, yeah
*  You're still hasn't reached his potential yet. But when it comes to kicks that dude is nobody
*  I see the best kicker in the sport. I think like I said, bro nose to nose brother
*  We're like great. Yes, pow
*  Oh
*  There's a clip of me like like he kicks through my hand
*  I was like, I never see him to I was like this motherfucker so fast
*  Oh, he hit BJ Penn with a 360 roundhouse kick brother crazy. Yeah crazy, bro
*  360 roundhouse kick on legend crazy, bro. Yeah, bro. Yeah, bro. I'm telling you bro. Like I said, bro. Yeah
*  Yeah, he's gonna be a problem, bro
*  There's one switch that he's gonna flip it's gonna see and I'm gonna and if you're a guy who likes to stay on the outside
*  And you fight that oh my god change everything is those kicks his kicks is like jabs like you said, mm-hmm
*  You know, he got kicks yet spinning shit. Yeah, he got he's fucking he got hell elbows, but he got everything
*  He's your elbow stupid. It's so even when I was fighting him, bro
*  Like we knew he's gonna try stupid up L. Wet places and I get fucking caught by I'm like what the fuck like why?
*  Why I knew it was coming and it hit me. I was like no what is going on?
*  This guy's is so freaking he's this he's out of the box. It's so dynamic
*  You can't find a guy that's gonna spar like him bro
*  Nobody's why cuz nobody's willing to take chances like it's good because when we were spying with it for him
*  Like I said, like we wouldn't really hit guys
*  And he does that to that left kick and then that right overhand yeah, those kicks are coming from everywhere
*  Look at this. I mean that that left kick to the body and then that right hand behind it. Yeah. Yeah
*  Josh Emmett's a scary motherfucker though. Whoo that knockout of
*  My god that dude he's got Harris for fist
*  But he's one of them load-up dudes, yeah, everything's coming for death every shots death
*  Yeah, I know that's why that's come an even Germany fought the two cook to two hammer dudes brother when they meet but they collided
*  That was a crazy fight yeah crazy fight
*  Yeah, I saw I saw somebody claim that as I thought of the German cuz I saw somebody claim that Josh was like the
*  Hardest-hitting 45-er and hit German like what someone say something
*  He's a bad man Stevens had some crazy crazy
*  Half held Osanjos. Oh, yeah, five. Yeah
*  Can crack
*  He's a wild dude. It's a crazy sport man. I mean there's there's really nothing like it in terms of me
*  I mean, I know I'm biased but in terms of excitement in terms of like when you go to you want to be entertained
*  Go watch some fights. Oh, bro for sure, you know, you know, it's funny because like a lot of people they can they can
*  Almost like put themself in a fight cuz we all fought
*  It is in our DNA like we all fought some point in our life
*  Like even if it wasn't like like a fight fight like you fought your siblings you fought your cousin
*  So everybody know that feeling like oh, this is nuts. This is crazy
*  You know like whoa what there so you had that feeling in you of like fighting you to say that you didn't fight your cousin
*  Or even your friend like even if there's a little slap fight whatever and you guys hugged it out after like you fought somebody
*  At some moment in your life and that's come that's like I'm so draws it and you can feel the emotion
*  And then when guys get into it, they're like, oh man, I would have did this do that do this
*  I'm like, yeah, okay
*  Talking about most people like grossly underestimate their abilities brother
*  But that's the game, you know, and that's why everybody loves it because it's so entertaining cuz it's like, oh my gosh
*  Yeah, you know, but then it's like almost sometimes some guys is just like just false hoping themselves. I'm like brother
*  Don't do that, you know, you know like guys guys calling out like a deep
*  Calling out Demetrius and then I call it on my mouse and then they showed it my most like rolled up that guy
*  and his you did to turn around like brother and
*  And even when even when we talk about this fake like it's like oh in a street fight when everybody's like, you know
*  Street like I'm whatever turn on your pond. It's true. Oh, yeah, she thought kick you right in the dick
*  The first thing I'm doing I'm like, I'm gonna kick you right in the baby maker
*  I'm gonna gouge your eyes. I'll bite your ear off with this is a street fight, but I'll have a gun
*  I'll shoot you who cares? I want to win in a street fight, you know, like no rules brother
*  Like come on the idea that if you give a guy no rules all sudden becomes lethal
*  Why what what you're not gonna scare me real angry when I would talk to karate guys
*  They'd say your stuff is good for sport, but what we do is for the street
*  I'm like, what are you talking about? Like that is the dumbest thing you could ever say you're practicing street techniques
*  Is that we did you not watch you see one?
*  But
*  There's so many people that just wanted that's the beautiful thing about MMA as well and all martial arts is that the training humbles you
*  Oh, yeah, the reality. Oh, yeah, I'm bulls you know, but you notice the most hilarious ones is when it
*  Does it like you see these guys troll they come and get their ass kicked and they're back on. Yeah
*  I'll just kick your ass. That was just one day, you know, watch when I started training
*  I'm like brother, but that wasn't it though. The conversation was saying you could kill me now, you know
*  It is funny. Yeah, there's some guys is a they need to do some study on their brains. It'd be would be amazing
*  Well, there's so many different kinds of mindsets that allow someone to get into fighting
*  But when they get to a championship level like what I try to explain to people
*  Did you understand the kind of human being that's capable of fighting the most skillful fighters in the world and rising above them all?
*  That's a rare person. There's a lot of things that had to fall in the place to make a max Holloway
*  Yeah, a lot of things for sure. Yeah, you know, and you're just like this peace loving like easygoing guy real friendly
*  I love it confused. Yeah. Yeah, there's a monster inside that head. You know, it's funny. So
*  When we train this is a while back when we training at our old gym
*  Some guys would come visit my head coach Ryan Lizards and then he he he and I'm around like wrestlers
*  So these guys like stack, you know wrestler bodies there is stack big small whatever and I'm just this little skinny kid
*  You know, this is when I started my UFC career
*  I'm the skinny kid if you look at the pictures like no chest having ass, you know
*  I look like a dork, you know, I next to this guy had some tattoos and then they asked them and they hit it
*  I had asked him. Oh, he was like if I told you you had to you had to fight one of these guys
*  You had to fight any one of these guys to leave the gym. Who would you fight?
*  Would you choose and then the guy chose me? He's like, oh you chose wrong cuz I got to kill you
*  He's like all these other guys you might have a chance cuz they might take you down and hold you down
*  Maybe grind upon you but that guy's gonna just straight kill you in any any way you could find
*  So yeah looks can be looks can be deceiving but looks like I said, I know I love I love harassing DC
*  But that guy looked like a bag of potatoes about that and he was a double champ and number one pound for bond in the world
*  But it's not looks right. It's a mindset and it's what you gotta do. Well fade or fade or do yeah
*  That's example that they always had a muffin top brother always always stood there
*  Make 205 oh, yeah easy easy, bro. He might be able to make 85 fade or walked around about
*  235 pounds to 20. I think so one time he was like 230 to 25. Yeah. Yeah fat
*  Never was ripped never was it fucked everybody up fucked everybody up
*  Crazy broke crazy and then crazy. It was crazy how Dan handle didn't like that
*  They got this is late, but like for Dan and do that and any point in their career is insane, bro
*  I know it's Dan Hendo is a man, but he's a bad motherfucker
*  If he was around during the belt, he'd be one of the guys fun for belt suit. Oh, yeah, he's a BMF, bro
*  I'm true. Oh, he's here his logo like I was like, oh you look so good his logo so good
*  I love I love this big one, bro. I know that's iconic
*  Well, it's iconic and that that knockout of fade or was iconic too. Cuz he's how is he fighting him at heavyweight?
*  What are you doing? No, why are you why are you fighting fade or at heavyweight? Who the fuck?
*  Any chaos
*  Yeah, poos not the back door escaped on the ground and hit him in an uppercut
*  Yeah, he was a monster man. Dan Henderson was a bad man. Oh bad man in the early days
*  I mean, he's a pioneer. I mean that guy is fighting in MMA in the 90s
*  Mother what 90 cuz I wasn't I was born in the one
*  Yeah, he was fighting MMA before you were born brother crazy you guys were in the same era
*  That's insane. That's insane. Yeah
*  Holy I know look there
*  Cuz your era started when you were 20 years old. Yeah, and while you're fighting Dan Henderson was the man
*  Yeah crazy fighting. Yeah crazy and he was fighting before your you were even conceived
*  Yeah years believe it thought up brother. I was even a thought not even a thought you were in another dimension waiting any day now
*  Yeah
*  And now here you are
*  Listen man, you I'm it's beautiful for me as a fan of you and as a friend to see this Renaissance and to see
*  People just giving you your due and you know, that's the thing that happens when a guy loses a couple of fights
*  They just they sleep well, you know, we were talking about it during the walk. I'm like max is only 32 years old
*  You have to understand he's in his prime right now
*  Like this is this is a guy who keeps getting better every time we see him and
*  They counted you out man, and you came up big
*  Brother I was just I you know, I shout out to Dana them Dana hunter charge the Sean Shelby bro behind the scenes
*  I'm sure we know what he did for this fight. He's he's a man, bro. He's the man and guys are great
*  Yeah, I couldn't I couldn't that pro yet
*  Just wrapping your head around but just to just to have that fight at USC 300 bro was oh
*  You see Tion just huge all around, you know
*  You know has a big card and then to get that finish like a lot of people saying it's the movie type finish
*  Against Justin Gaethje a guy who's supposed to you said it best outgun me too big too strong
*  Yeah, it was supposed to fucking Tony 2.0 me whatever the hell that means
*  How much of a favorite was he at fight time brother when I fight them? He still is 2 to 1
*  I believe he was like 2 to 1
*  I think said it open at like 260 and then I think so he closed at like 2 3 I might be wrong
*  But then I'm wearing that people told me it was like state 2 to 1. So is it I'm just happy
*  You know a lot of my fans. They don't really get me a bond the dog
*  So, you know, thank you for rocking with me for many years
*  There it is. Well, it was the biggest challenge of your career and it was the best performance
*  I mean you're you were on point man
*  The strategy the movement everything that jump spinning back kick cuz DC kept saying like this is a new skill like the way he's
*  Lazy my friend, bro
*  New skill I've been doing this from like my third USC fight ever you have but it was way better now
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's way better now. Yeah, it's like it's it's like anything right? Like it's going to get better
*  I can't we can't probably sing it well
*  Like like you said you bro, you know how devastating this kick is
*  Thank you can change even if you if you if you landed on the liver, you're gonna even if it doesn't hurt it
*  It's gonna like longevity. It's like I like saying what Teddy Atlas say, you know, you put water in the basement
*  I land that good in in your stomach. Yeah, it doesn't feel it doesn't feel nice brother
*  Even if you look normal, yeah, you know, it's and then I touch you touch you there
*  It's just gonna shock your whole body and it's going to hurt. It's going to hurt. So that's spinning back kick brother
*  Like I said the video game watching you bend the bag brother if you could put up that clip that bro
*  You was bending that bag and I was like what the fuck like how did this kick is strong as shit?
*  Like I was just thinking of like breaking people spleens with it, you know, that was my best one
*  Yeah, that's me. Now is an old man though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The other one was a younger one. Yeah, but it's still I
*  Do it right look at that
*  Yeah, the thing about old people today like that's what's interesting about this Jake Paul Mike Tyson fight
*  Old people today have hormone replacement hormone replacements a game changer. Oh, yeah, it's a different thing
*  Oh, yeah, a 57 year old man today like Mike Tyson. It's like that's not a 57 year old man from 1994
*  This is the one. Yeah, that's the 360
*  So the idea the idea to explain that was that I forget who used to use that a lot Oh
*  Cungley boom look at this, but that's the over. That's this the cup. I saw holy fuck
*  I think what the hell is your roguing drogues on drugs?
*  Oh
*  Bro look at that look at your full extent. Look at the hip positive when we're in he brought to
*  Freaking land on the bag, bro. Look at the full extension bro. You hit so
*  Yeah, look at that. Look. Oh my gosh. That's where you get the man
*  Our yeah, that's crazy. That's maximum amount of power
*  He'll facing them your head looking at it and you're landing with your heel and I'm looking over my right. Yeah
*  Turned away so I got full extension
*  Pushing off the back leg kicking with the front leg brother
*  It's crazy power and it's not utilized that much Dennis Seaver used to have a good one. Oh, that's it was really good
*  I liked him. Yeah, you had a real good one
*  And then we're going back to what you saying brother with the with Mike Tyson like did you see the clips of him like moving?
*  Bro, yeah, he looks good, bro
*  To prepare imagine he go in there and just
*  It's a guy bro, what is going on he's gonna be hell on wheels in the first round for sure
*  He's gonna be hell on wheels, you know, because I don't know how long he can go
*  I don't know what his joints feel like or his back feels like I don't know what's really going on and you're watching clips
*  Have a guy hit that's not yeah, let's hope he gets something crazy and then yeah
*  He say his back is broken that iconic speed
*  Get another iconic speed from it's gonna be interesting and it's the only time I could ever
*  Remember where I was I would be interested in watching a 57 year old man fight a 20 year old man
*  Yeah, for sure. Like you said like even bro like cuz everybody saw him walking around the cane, right?
*  He's walking around what if he trolling everybody? What if he knew bro?
*  What if he knew something we didn't know what if he's wearing or seeing us all over, you know, but but even that bro
*  They had the new video of him moving. I'm like, this is not fair. What is he doing?
*  They're gonna do everything to him. They're gonna give him all the hormones all the recovery everything
*  They're gonna do everything they can to get him ready for that. There's a lot of money in this
*  That's a lot of money, and it's only an exhibition, right?
*  It's not even a real fight, right and they have 16 ounce gloves and they they have to fight two minutes
*  Yeah, but you can still kill someone with 69 if you're Mike Tyson fuck. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah, if you're Mike Tyson, you know
*  I mean, I mean even Paul bro pause pause not a small guy. No, he's big like a lot of guys think he's tiny
*  He's he's a huge boy. He's a big dude and he can crack
*  Yeah, and I always say that people look at him like a guy who was a youtuber and they're denying
*  More boner before when he first was coming out. That's the way that's the way you should look at him
*  But now he got like he had like a love in his corner like love is his main trainer
*  Oh, what is it? John love or he's one of Floyd boys
*  That guy is he was like a legit world champion at one point
*  So he knows the training that he has to be done like before I was like, yeah, whatever
*  When you see Paul dedicate himself and how he's training getting ready for these guys like he's a businessman too
*  Don't get me wrong, but he's training
*  He's not he's not freaking cutting no corners, but he got the right guys
*  You got a right team strain conditioning probably eating right eating good fighting on his terms, bro. Yeah
*  Guys, what did you think of Anthony Joshua and Francis and Gatto? Oh
*  brother brother crazy, right sucks, I thought I thought if if
*  Anthony was gonna be able to like really shock the world
*  This was I was like I give him Anthony Joshua first
*  I I was thinking that like he he could have Andy Ruiz
*  Like Joshua is known for like kind of getting caught and he gets rocked
*  so like I always thought that Anthony not Anthony, but the gun who had the
*  Opportunity to be like oh you can probably strike him, you know, you can hurt him
*  You can probably hurt him with a hand especially cuz nobody knew anything about
*  Yeah before the Tyson fight but I think sort of Tyson fight shook up the world and and these guys like even like what's his name
*  Joshua was saying that there was a gimmick fight and he's the next guy
*  Yeah, how you called? How you call no God no gimmick fight and you fight him next and well any trained
*  You know, I mean like you could tell bro
*  He was like not like what he did to Tyson brother like a lot of people I
*  Thought he won bro when I watching it I was like bro this guy
*  He won I think this guy's about to shake up the whole thing
*  But of course it's boxing there, you know, it is what it is
*  But yeah, and it's when Francis went out there
*  He was saying that like he was tired the time whatever right and like like the thing
*  But Anthony Joshua looks so good. He's so good, bro. It's just a difference in skill
*  Yeah, caught him with that right hand the first round. Yeah and rocked him
*  It's just a difference in skill level like Anthony Joshua is an Olympic gold medalist
*  And you can see you can see look the faint look the thing look what he's doing. He's already he's already
*  Even dropping his hand, you know, he's also shooting that jab to the body
*  Yeah, and looking for Francis to counter with that left hook. Yes can't Francis leans back and throws that left hook
*  Oh, yeah, he goes like this. Yeah, and that's what he caught and that's what he caught Tyson fury with
*  Look, look, he leaned back there too. Look he leans it back. Oh man
*  Yeah, it was a big win. Oh, this guy is some big dudes big win for boxing is
*  Yeah, big win for Josh was so fast, too. Yeah
*  He's so fast and he's he matches him strength wise. Yeah. Yeah. Yes different than Tyson few
*  Yeah straight and and speed, you know, but much faster. Yeah, that right hand. Oh right over
*  That right hand over the tie. He was fucked here. Now. He gets up. He's in real trouble here. Yeah, and doom
*  I mean that right he never even moved bro. He didn't even see it. No, he did not even see it brother
*  Oh, he was already out here like he's but
*  But you saw how that set up because if he was doing the jab to the body like you said jab to the body
*  Yeah, so he's he just sat down and stuff kind of froze going back. I mean this got overhand perfect beautiful boxing boxing exhibition, man
*  Beautiful boxing you ever think you're gonna do any boxing matches?
*  I don't know. I don't know. I would love to it'd be fun. Yeah. Yeah, I would say who you know
*  But like like I said, we got a lot of I got it's not even worth calling out or doing anything cuz I didn't
*  They I'm with the UFC and if the UFC don't see it making money
*  They're not gonna give it and then all I'm gonna be is be one of these dumbasses on the internet calling out
*  Stupid fights for no reason. It's not gonna happen. You know, I mean, right so at the end of the day
*  It is what I would love if personally if you ask me, I would love to box but I would love to
*  To to I I have some boxing some boxing cousins that's coming up in the boxing world right now
*  Even even a friend he just fought on the 20th. He just won
*  JJ Benito, he's the man and
*  And in my cousin and they're coming up they're fighting my cousin them and I would love to box when I box in them
*  It's fun. It's having fun
*  I have a great and then to go in there and actually box someone to see the difference. I would love to see it
*  You have like right now like at 32 years old do you have a timeline for the rest of your career?
*  Do you have a thought? I don't I don't I don't wanna I don't want to fight to a 240 for sure
*  You know, I mean like, you know, I always thought like maybe 35 36. We kind of look at it
*  It all depends on where I'm at in my career
*  You know if I'm stood in the top five and and you know, it chat or even championship level if I'm stood here
*  I'm doing what I'm doing here at 35 36
*  Maybe we squeeze out a little bit, but then I I always I tell you every time we talk, you know
*  I want I want I want to retire the game. I don't want the game to retire my ass brother
*  Cuz how much time we see?
*  Not only in our sports but any sports the greats
*  They just don't they don't they don't leave when they supposed to leave and it just kind of like yeah
*  They have a great legacy
*  But it kind of hurts it at the end like even though you can talk about the great stuff that they did it still it kind
*  Of hurts them. I go you kind of stayed you over stage your welcome, you know
*  And and that's come I got a bunch of other stuff, you know that I'm trying to try to get into like like I said
*  With this new brew drink that you're drinking
*  You know, I'm a corner that I the streaming stuff. I love you. I know you love gaming
*  I don't know if you've been gaming but the streaming stuff. I love it now
*  that's great and I love being playing games cuz at the end of day a lot of these guys that
*  they Dennis that identified himself with their sport and
*  When they retire they don't have nothing so they come back anyway because they kind of lose themselves they feel like oh
*  This is my identity. So I'm trying to build these stuff. So I have another venture
*  So as soon as we go I can try and attack this like I would love to stream when I'm older
*  You know even freaking
*  Podcasts or interview or do something like you need these guys need to understand that
*  They need something outside of their sport before they let go, you know, like Kobe was doing it, right?
*  You know, I mean rest in peace to him, but he did it, right?
*  You know when he was getting rid of surfing he started doing his podcast. He started doing all kind of other stuff
*  He started getting more in hand with his daughter's
*  Basketball like he was doing stuff to make himself forget about what he did and he was focusing on other stuff to make himself
*  Great in another way. So that's the main thing, you know, as long as I can compete at an elite level
*  You know, I don't want to be this guy that just hanging on and everybody like oh man
*  I know I'd fucking it would sadden me today that I'm fucking walking out to a fight and Joe
*  This this this but you know, he's a little bit older now like I'd be fucking I would be distraught
*  You know, I mean I'd be like what the fuck I don't want fucking Joe Rogan talking my ass walking out of the fight like that
