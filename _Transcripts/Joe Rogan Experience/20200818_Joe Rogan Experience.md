# Joe Rogan Experience #1527 - David Blaine
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY3Zg37nIHo)
*  This is a great collection. Yeah, this is these are all from plastic cell look even the sunglasses come off on wow yeah
*  It's pretty dope
*  John wick and his pitbull
*  Awesome, yeah, I got Kanye Bruce Lee, but the glasses are big. He's I know well this guy's amazing
*  Shout out to the phone from plastic cell and make some dope shit
*  Yeah, he's amazing not as amazing as that shit you did in the green room man
*  David just did some card wizardry that uh
*  It's one thing that you see when you see that shit on TV like if I was there. I'd see some shit
*  I know what's going on, but when you see it in real life. You're like
*  What is happening here? It's way better like in person than oh? Oh? Yeah? Well at the end
*  I don't give it any way, but the end
*  Literally a man is holding one of his wrists and another guy's holding the other wrist
*  And he still does the card trick, and we still can't figure out what happened
*  When did you get started? How old were you um?
*  So I was about five years old when I started playing with cards
*  But I didn't know what what they were for really so I just had a deck of cards that I carried everywhere
*  But I like the way it felt you know just like it felt like something cool
*  So eventually a librarian was like oh, we got this like magic
*  Self-working card trick book and do you want to learn something and I was like yeah?
*  Of course and she shows me the most this that silly self-working mathematical trick
*  That's a long process to do, but it's still a cool outcome like oh, I found your card right right and
*  My mother I used to wait for her at the library, and she'd come get me when she was done
*  And
*  When she came I said can I show you this trick and the librarian was excited for me to do it to her
*  Which is what I do to my friends kids
*  I teach them a trick and make them really good at it, and I'm so excited to see them do it
*  You know right okay, so my mother comes I do the trick and my mom goes crazy like it was
*  best thing ever
*  And so it like but that began the love of wanting to learn new tricks because I wanted to keep making her you know react
*  You know yeah, so that was basically the fundamental start of it and then also
*  she would take me to Coney Island all the time and
*  You know on the side on the boardwalk there. There's those weird freak show performers
*  So I'd watch those guys and it to me it was all like magical so that that was kind of the beginning of it
*  So isn't it funny how one positive experience when you're young can ignite this chain of events
*  Yeah, that changes your whole life by the way and also so then the librarian when I would come
*  She would give me books, and I would start looking at that little magic section
*  That was between like games and puzzles
*  I thought I always wished magic would be like not there like it should be like an art or so you know just
*  It was always like when you want a magic book
*  It's always like that silly like kids jokey thing, but there's like so in that section
*  I
*  Pulled out a book and I was like six years old and I see a guy
*  Chained to the side of a building staring out looking like death is upon it
*  And that was Houdini and I didn't know anything about what that all meant
*  I looked through the pictures, and he was hanging upside down and stuff like that
*  But when I went to sleep I would have these dreams of this guy chained to the side of a building and that began my
*  Curiosity and love of Houdini and then that began my curiosity of like not just like the magic trick stuff
*  But like this stuff that's to me. It's more like real
*  Yeah, how do those two worlds collide because some of the things you're doing there?
*  They're just insane endurance and mental exercises and then other things you're doing are what you would consider magic
*  Right so so I love both separately like independently like I always love
*  Like I had a karate teacher at the YMCA that used to make us all run barefoot in the snow in the winter in
*  Brooklyn and all the kids really you know we're young we're like six seven and all the kids like ah
*  You know and afraid they were gonna cut their feet on glass whatever and I would run in it
*  And I felt like I could do this because I wasn't good at other things
*  Physically like I was more at my feet turned in and stuff like that
*  So I felt like this I could do these things so then I
*  Learned how to hold my breath and the reason I learned how to hold my breath was simply because I was on the swim
*  Team at the Y also and the other kids would swim back and forth and they'd destroy me because my feet didn't function perfectly
*  well
*  And what I learned is that if I didn't breathe if I just swam it would save me time because I didn't have to move
*  My head dip it out and you know mm-hmm, right?
*  So I would just swim and a coach would gallop me, but suddenly I was no longer in last place
*  And sometimes first and that began my like oh god
*  You can actually do what the coach doesn't think is possible you could swim there and back without breathing and then the older kids would
*  Come to see me do that and I would like challenge them. I'd be like um
*  Let's see you could stay under the longest and go up and down five times
*  I didn't understand the physiology of it that like going up and down doesn't help
*  It's more effective to just sit through the pain and just kind of chill
*  But I would just sit there and they'd go up and come back down it which makes it worse that they'd be out
*  and I'd make it worse because
*  The breath holding thing is all about like a co2 buildup in your bloodstream, and it's about a tolerance level to it
*  So if you relax and efficiently keep your oxygen not make this co2 buildup more extreme
*  You can actually hold more efficiently so when you have that feeling everybody has that feeling where you need to breathe
*  Yes, it's not an o2 deprivation
*  It's a trigger from a co2 buildup which is giving you an alert that for example in
*  20 minutes from now you will not recover and I didn't believe that either some a magician friend of mine who's amazing
*  and and one of my like
*  heroes in life
*  He
*  He told me a story as I was doing like buried alive. I'm listening
*  He said you know you know the Navy SEALs, you know, they black them out underwater
*  So they're not afraid of drowning and I'm like that can't no way like because it seems so abstract to me
*  You know
*  So but it's stuck in my brain and then when I wanted to do the water tank stunt and I started learning about
*  freediving and stuff like that I suddenly
*  Realized blacking out is pretty straightforward like you black out and then you get your head above the water
*  And if you're supervised you're fine
*  So when I went to San Diego with the SEALs
*  I watched what they do and I actually did it but I didn't black out
*  I went back and forth a few times in the pool
*  but they have that viewing pool and they rope the SEALs up to some 45 pound weights and they have to walk across the bottom of
*  the pool and the instructors are swimming above them and
*  When this when the SEALs black out they cut the rope bring them up to the top and they're fine
*  but what that teaches you is that you do not need to worry about being underwater because if you're with a team and you
*  By the way, nobody should try this, you know, there is extreme dangers to shallow water blackouts which lead to death
*  but if you are in
*  Somebody that's training and you have a team and you want to push it as soon as you black out
*  It's like getting knocked out says but it feels better. It's not like getting knocked out with a punch
*  It's like you get a knife. It's your for no, but no, yeah, but it's your fork, right? Yeah exactly
*  Except this one's even better and then you have all these dreams. No
*  Exciting that part of it when whenever I wake up from a blackout. I'm like, whoa
*  That's how people wake up when they get choked out really the same. Yeah
*  Yeah, when people get choked out they wake up almost like they were dreaming like sometimes they think they're at a disco. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, it's amazing
*  It's not the best thing in the world for you, but it's way better for you than getting knocked unconscious
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Yeah choked out is just a just shuts off the blood to the blank brain right and the brain shuts off
*  Yeah, and then it comes back online, but there's no trauma, right? Yeah, but it's not yeah
*  So it's like a she and blacking out on the blacking out underwater thing
*  Probably not a good idea to do too many times though, right? No, you could do it
*  I mean I've blacked out underwater a lot. I mean
*  By the way, so okay times. I don't know like between
*  20 to 30, I mean I have to wow by the way you guys were talking about me on the thing about the breath hold
*  Yeah, yeah one time I went 20 minutes and two seconds
*  I almost did what you were talking about the length of a show but I did 20 minutes and two seconds and I had
*  Telemetry there and I had pulmonary experts and everything like that and my heart rate dropped to eight beats per minute
*  Holy shit, and they pulled me up because they were freaked out like you were dying
*  But back to what I was saying is the reason besides the Navy SEAL story that I knew that it was it made sense was because
*  You hear about the kids in the news like in 1984 or whatever. It was a kid was under an icy river for 45 minutes
*  Yeah
*  with
*  Nothing blacked out unconscious underwater for 45 minutes. They rescue him out pull him back
*  recover him and full recovery
*  So there's something that the body does that we don't understand it
*  but if you actualize so because he blacked out and because it was so cold the blood something occurred were all like the same as
*  when you get cold the blood rushes away from the extremities and protects the vital organs and
*  Because he didn't inhale the water because he was completely out of it when they recovered him
*  They didn't even have to get water out of his lungs and he was perfectly fine
*  So but but that just shows you that there's like certain levels of of what the body can tolerate that we have no idea
*  so you
*  In learning how to swim and learning how to go all the way back and forth and holding your breath this started this idea of
*  Holding your breath for an extreme long period of time like what had been the record before you had like 20 minutes and how many seconds?
*  Two seconds. Yeah, that's what you did. Yeah, but that's not the right done
*  You done before that would have been your record
*  Okay
*  so when I was a kid I heard as I start reading about Houdini his like proud record of his lifetime and he's the
*  underwater escape king for a hundred years ago and he had he was around the best swimmers and he had access and
*  He got up to three and a half minutes. So by the time I was like
*  Teenage early teenager I got to three and a half minutes
*  Think that that was a barrier that couldn't be crossed it
*  Well, I came I blacked out as I came out, but I didn't know what that all meant
*  Right, so I blacked out was that so I was like, okay that 330 seems like the edge
*  but then
*  When I started working on the actual concept of like how long can you hold your breath for then?
*  I started looking into them like oh wow
*  there's like people that can do five minutes six minutes seven minutes and then there was a hypothetical record of
*  A
*  Hypothetical
*  13 minute record but no evidence of it and that was on puro 2
*  So it was a hypothetical puro 2 record of 13 when you say on puro 2
*  What's your process if that flushes everything out? So you start to make your own to you hold on to puro 2?
*  Yeah, I go under I purge really hard on puro 2 so
*  Which is like hyperventilator which gets rid of the co2 and gives you more room for oxygen and by the way
*  I just went up to 25,000 feet in an airplane ascending at 500 feet per minute doors open everything
*  No oxygen and I was with
*  Luke Akins who jumped from 25,000 feet with no parachute landed in that he was with me and two other the pilot and two other
*  guys we just right under 25 as a 24 7 whatever and
*  He's I said, let's see who goes hypoxic first, right?
*  So no, no, no, but we have no but you have to take the ox the 02 you have to take the 02
*  Monters you have to be on them, right?
*  so
*  And I was already in a hypobaric chamber with the FA at Oklahoma City and I started purging just to see what it would do
*  And my levels my oxygen level shot up which nobody believes is possible
*  So I get into the airplane and we put the monitors on and everybody's around the same. I was actually lower than Luke
*  I was like at 90 whatever
*  596 he was at like 97 he's like, oh my god, you know joking with me and as soon as we cross 15,000 feet
*  His slowly is starting to come down and I start doing the breathing technique the
*  Purging out like I said, right my oxygen levels and we filmed all this shot up to 98 and then 99%
*  Is I went up to 23
*  Plus
*  Thousand feet now these guys think I'm a magician. So they're like, yeah, uh-huh like fake news
*  That's what he wrote on the paper next to the levels because he was recording it
*  So I took his monitor off of his finger and he took mine
*  I put his monitor on my finger put mine on his bang
*  His was dropping around 70 and mine was 98 99
*  Then I switch with day I switch with
*  Everybody on the plane and the oxygen levels with the breathing all the way up to that altitude
*  And I'm not recommending this because I haven't tested enough in it
*  but they did stay up at 98 99 and so my evidence for that was
*  you hear about all the Sherpas that go up to the top of Everest up to 29,000 feet and
*  They're not bringing oxygen. I get it. They're acclimating six, but they're still at
*  29 plus thousand feet so they're doing something that's allowing them to rewire their ability to not go hypoxic
*  So this breathing technique you're essentially exhaling more than you're breathing in so you're breathing a small amount in
*  and then and then I fill up everything for
*  full, but I mean full like top to bottom hold for a second and then
*  Exhale slowly and I'd like for example if when we're done here if you have 20 minutes
*  I'll get you up to a four and a half minute breath hold
*  In 20 minutes, and this is just through these breathing techniques. Yeah when we're done with this
*  I'll show you how to do it and you will get up to four plus minutes for sure
*  And how did you so you've learned that you could go three and a half minutes or three minutes plus right and yeah and and blackout
*  And then how did you have it in your head that you were going to eventually get to 20 minutes?
*  Okay, so you really want to hear all yeah, yeah, it's a long. Oh, let's go. Okay, and I forget where I'm going
*  Okay, okay, okay, so you might have to remind me where we're going yeah, okay?
*  I just want to know the process because okay
*  Mission by trade well, but first of all I like Houdini, so I love magic
*  But I like Houdini and Houdini was like king of cards as well
*  But he's a guy that's doing real thing right and then I like guys that are like as I go I go to the museum
*  Of broadcasting because there was no YouTube or whatever
*  So I'd look at like these magic you search magic
*  And I'd find like guys that would like drink a gallon of water drink a liter of kerosene
*  He would float all the kerosene on top of the water
*  And then he would spit out kerosene out of his mouth look like a human dragon and then put the fire out with a gallon
*  of water, so it's that it is magic, but it's
*  It's art it's mind-blowing
*  It's a performance P. It's not like it's incredible now look there's guys that are card guys that are like that also
*  Like lots lots of people I love him or so they do the cards in a way
*  That's like but but that act to me was what pressed a button it was like whoa
*  Like how is he converting his body to do a trick?
*  And there's a guy today performing called Stevie star who's called the human regurgitator
*  But he swallows crazy things like so he combines magic with his ability
*  So he went on Jay Leno or one. Yeah, I think was in or Carson was
*  He takes a you know the little film canisters that used to drink so he puts a film canister empty
*  I closes it for the you know you get the 35 and then he goes and then he swallows it
*  So it's in it's yeah, it's gone. He goes like that. It's gone
*  Then he would take a bunch of water drink that and then there'd be a cup with a goldfish in it
*  Drinks a cup in the goldfish, and then he have Jay Leno signed the cap the the lid thing to the
*  Thing with a piece of tape and sign it right then he'd take that go now everything is gone
*  Then he does these weird sounds and movements which is part of his show right and then he brings it up spits it out and
*  The
*  Film canister is sealed and it is the water and the fish and it's sealed with the signature
*  So to me that's like the coolest magic because you take because when you see a trick, you know like oh, that's cool
*  But it's a trick so it's like you're being removed from being able to like absorb
*  But when you see somewhere somebody's doing something crazy, and it seems like a trick
*  But it's also like wait. This is real because he's really doing this it's just way more exciting
*  You know I understand I understand. It's just
*  Do you know how he did that one?
*  I talked to him all the time. I love Stevie Stevie star
*  You know how it was done, but you can't reveal that right yeah, and okay
*  There's another guy Tom Molica who he passed away, and he was this guy
*  He's the first magician ever so he did a simple card trick, and I was crying
*  I was like good tears. I was like oh my god
*  But and he passed away and I filmed that and and he's
*  I'm gonna do a really amazing piece about him because he is incredible
*  But he also was on like Johnny Carson shows what he would do is
*  He would take a pack of cigarettes throw them into his mouth one at a time like them on fire
*  Bring them back out and then throw them into his mouth one at a time eat all the cigarettes yes
*  There is
*  Watch he eats a cigarette wow that's great how fast they pull that up. It's not day. It's young Jamie
*  Oh is you he's a wizard. Yeah, he's a wizard
*  Yeah, look so he takes by the way the sack killed him so that's how dedicated to his crafty. Did it really yeah look
*  He he was eating a pack of cigarettes every night on stage
*  I mean just think all of them and then all those 20 cigarette
*  Yeah, and then but wait he also throws them into his mouth like oh my god
*  So now he's chewing them what was he chewing
*  He's just amazing, but holy yeah, I get to where he's throwing them into his mouth, too
*  Oh boy. Yes, he throws them into his mouth one at a time. They're lit
*  He chews them up swallows them his mouth is lady look at the lady
*  Fuck am I doing here? Oh my god look at that stack
*  In his mouth and then look the whole thing goes in by the way
*  He also throws him one at a time does all that puts the paper in oh
*  Jesus Christ and swallows it all oh
*  My god yep, he's so how did this kill him?
*  Every single night just one he shares a night at a bar doing cigarettes in your mouth on fire eating them swallowing them
*  He died cancer yeah, yeah
*  Boy yeah, but wait so so he spits them out eventually or he just swallows them
*  I'm not gonna give away his genius
*  Yeah, see that's the thing it's like this is a guy that died for his art
*  Yeah, wow
*  So another the guy was telling you about that's like my favorite card magi the guy that taught that showed me the Navy Seal
*  But just an amazing just as a library he he's like this genius that if he came here
*  Which he never would because he would never show anybody anything
*  But if he did and he showed you a couple of moves like the first move
*  He showed me was actually a card move called ascension
*  Where he makes the card float right through the deck and like the greatest magician of all time like card magician said it was one
*  Of the greatest tricks ever done you won't be able to find it anywhere because it's not a video
*  But he he only does it to a couple of magicians so he performs for like you know a handful of his friends
*  he shows a move and it's mind-blowing and luckily he showed me stuff when I was young, but
*  He'll never ever perform. He's like does a painter paint so he can show people it does a painter paint to paint
*  but whenever you're on the phone with him, you just hear cards like he's like
*  And he's doing it. He's doing it. He's doing I'm telling you like 13 day long 13 hours a day
*  He's doing card moves alone, and I said, but I was like Bill. What do you do? Do you like do the trick to yourself?
*  But he said he doesn't believe that it's not to him. It's not a performance to him
*  It's it's just about the technical love and feel of of that well
*  That's that there's a Japanese phrase for that about doing something
*  Over and over and over and over the exact same thing over and over again to you achieve a level of perfection
*  That is almost
*  physically unattainable to mere mortals you
*  Bypass what a person thinks the the body would be capable of doing. Yep. Yeah, that's that's it
*  That's it. That's what he's doing. That is the thing or you can
*  You know James Nestor is yeah, of course the book. Yes. Yeah deep is amazing
*  I don't know deep but that's a book you're a thief
*  Yeah, breath is the one that I read and I had him on the podcast to talk about it amazing
*  I was talking about this monk that was literally
*  meditating and doing breathing exercises all day long for 30 years and
*  Could do these insane things with his body like vary the temperature from one hand to another change the blood flow
*  Change it literally from one finger to the other shore and that yeah
*  you the only way you could get to that place is you have to be that guy sits in a cave and
*  Does breath work all day long for 30 years and most people just aren't willing to do that
*  But if you do do that, there are some levels that you can reach that are just unattainable
*  to a normal person and even
*  If you would talk to but I agree with the scientists and doctors know but it is a table to normal people because
*  When somebody gets paralyzed or something, right?
*  I've seen people that the doctors say you're done
*  And they spend all day of every single waking moment trying to get like a little moment
*  Just like a tiny bit of movement in their little toe and eventually if they do what you're saying if yes
*  So it it is that yeah, it is that it's but most people are not willing to get to that place
*  Most people are not gonna sit there shuffling cars 13 hours a day like your friend
*  Yeah, but there's people that can do that
*  Like when I was watching you move the cards around it's interesting like you ever watch a movie where a guy smoking a cigarette
*  You know that guy doesn't really smoke you can kind of tell by the way. He's holding the cigarette
*  You're moving these cards around like your your edge detection like your understanding of where the head
*  It's very interesting to watch your fingers move because they're so they're so educated, you know
*  Because of all the commentary that I do with martial arts and my years in martial arts
*  It's I'm fascinated by how different people move and they do the same thing
*  They it looks different when other people do it
*  There's certain people that will throw a punch and you just walk out of here you go Jesus
*  There's something about the the fluidity of the motion that's stunning even to this day
*  And that was when I was watching you move your fingers and watching you move the cars like this motherfucker
*  Shuffle a lot of cards. There's a weirdness to the the movement of your hands, but I think it's what you're saying
*  It's like the punch thing. It's like there's yeah. Yeah, but it's it is
*  But it's it's the you you the mind
*  Forces the body into moving over and over and over again, you know you do it to this level of perfection
*  That you did for a person like me who doesn't know anything about cards. I don't know anything about card tricks
*  I don't know how they work. I can't shuffle if you watch me shuffle you'd fucking laugh at me
*  But I watch your hand movements. I'm like oh
*  This is amazing
*  It's amazing
*  But now there's guys that I'm around that I wouldn't even pull a deck of cards out of my pocket if they're near me
*  Because they're that guy that does it 13 hours. Yeah, like like like the guy just
*  Fascinating though, but but yeah, but there's also different aspects to it. So like you know, there's also guys
*  I'm not gonna go into details. Okay, but I met it
*  I feel like I shouldn't even say this but it's fine because it's fine. So I met a kid once
*  Who moved to Las Vegas?
*  When he was this is a crazy story to tell
*  Damn, but it's a good story. Okay, I won't go into details. So he moved to Las Vegas and he was 12
*  He moved there because he wanted to meet a specific person who was considered
*  The best card sheet ever
*  Meaning the guy this is a guy that the reason that Vegas has those instead of like the dealer peeking the
*  Down card they have to put it into a machine and push a button
*  He's the guy that the movie casino was built around with the computer in the shoe. Like he was the the best
*  card sheet ever but among magicians
*  He's like a phenomenon because he's working on moves not to entertain anybody
*  He's working on move so he doesn't get his hands smashed up against the wall binions
*  Right. So he's working on moves. So he's not gonna get killed survival. Yes. Yeah, so he right so
*  This kid at the age of 12
*  Knows about him
*  Moves to Las Vegas and buys a craps table
*  He puts the craps table it's him and his mom right as my single mother and him they live in this small apartment
*  very close to the man I was telling you about and this kid throws dice
*  15 hours a day on this craps table, by the way, their little bed is like under the tape
*  You know, I mean, it's a small space and it's a real craps table like a nice one
*  The only thing he does is repetitiously throw this and he can helicopter spin the dice
*  Helicopter spin the dice so you can't see them doing this
*  They have such force going around this way that when they hit the wall
*  One die won't break the number and he can throw it exactly to this part of the of the table
*  Missing this from across the table so that one died locks and every time he can guarantee that number
*  He did that every day for almost a decade until he could throw dice better than any other human being in the world
*  Then he went and got a job at one of the casinos that text for car cheats and worked in the craps tables
*  It's all he did and as soon as he turned 21
*  He went out travels the world and wins the exact amount of money that he should win playing craps where you're not detected
*  But but you can what is the exact amount? I mean I'm under you know, probably a million
*  Yeah, I probably a few million a year. So I'm saying it's not like he's going in and getting ready
*  It's it's very smart and structured
*  Yeah, and that's all different places and he can throw dice like I've never seen anybody throw dice. It's crazy
*  I know that they take people that are really good at cards
*  Like my friend Dana White has been barred from casinos because he wins at blackjack. He's probably just counting
*  I don't know what he's doing. Yeah, he's counting but they've kicked him out of casinos because he's won a lot of money
*  But he's also lost a lot of money
*  Which is bizarre to me that you can go to a place and do really well and they're like you're doing too
*  Well, you got to get out of here. Well, they also it says mine every day
*  We have the right to refuse anybody which is important because they do that with dice is the question
*  Get that how they would do that with car. Do you want to hear a nice? Yeah, but this isn't me doing magic
*  This is luck. Okay. Okay, so I don't believe it is I don't like the way you paused
*  But I'm serious, I know but I'm saying that because I'm trying to be convincing. Okay. Okay, so because I'm telling the truth
*  But anyway, I go to the palms, you know the yeah, okay and
*  they had a bet on the craps table called the fire bet and it was like a
*  Game where you have to hit all the numbers open and close without but crapping out
*  So when I walk up to the table
*  Right away the the pit boss and everybody they make a big deal like you can't touch the dice and they're like I said you
*  Can call up I can touch the dice them because you know, they invited me so I could touch the dice
*  and
*  Because I wanted to throw right. I don't want to just gamble and a rant. So anyway, I am
*  Because even though I'm not cheating I still feel like, you know, maybe I'll get it
*  I have a little bit of an ability that's given you know what I mean, right?
*  Not a cheating ability, but maybe I'm a little better than a random person. I don't know right got it. So
*  The pit ball they make a joke and then the woman pit boss comes out
*  She says well if you take your shirt off, we'll let you throw the dice joking
*  I so anyway what I do is I bet for everybody at the tennis I go to the low stakes table always so the high stakes
*  It was that Super Bowl team right over there and they're like, ah, they're all crazy, right?
*  Like all excited with these big bets. I'm here with this table. We all have little bets
*  Right, did I say let's put a fire bet down for everybody
*  So I put the fire bit down for every single person at the table including the dealers the pit
*  I mean the pit ball, you know the you know with the dice and
*  I'm throwing the dice throwing the dice and this goes on for two and a half hours. I keep throwing the dice
*  I didn't hit us. I didn't crap out. I hit sevens in between each number
*  I don't know how craps work. So you have to roll like a five let's say and then I'm like, oh no
*  I need to roll another five which is
*  Statistically much more difficult than a seven because seven is the most common number to come up
*  So if you roll a five you're like, uh-oh that's hard because you can only get a two three or three two on both
*  Dice or a one four or four one. So you have a four out of 36
*  So it's a one and nine. So you're probably gonna crap out before you get the number. That's why the game is to their favor
*  so
*  throwing the dice and
*  it's two and a half hours later and
*  they stop everything and
*  they're like
*  Your fire bet just hit
*  And the table goes what does that mean? They go? Well, you all just won like ten grand each and they all go
*  Everybody's go they gave me the taste. Everybody's going nuts and we hit the fire but which they've now removed from the palms
*  By the way, but it was it was a pretty unheard of like the odds of hitting that bet is pretty rare
*  But it's just luck
*  Nobody should hit that bet I mean statistically it's unlikely and I wasn't cheating so yeah
*  So do they but the question I'm lucky for some reason I'm like I'm lucky with dice
*  Right, but I'm not I but I can tell you I would be if I was great with dice
*  I tell you I was great by the way, I actually have a die on
*  The story for this reason but I do have a die on me have you practiced with dice
*  No, yes, but I'm terrible at it
*  But it does make sense that
*  What that is that that's a physical thing and then if you develop a touch you develop a feel you do something over and over
*  And over well, this is different. But here look take the die. Okay, and and
*  can you like
*  Put it between your hand or whatever like and can you mix it like that?
*  And then squeeze it when you're done or no keep it hidden but put it on the table
*  But make sure you can't see it and I can't see it. It's a you greet like no one could see that right?
*  Are you sure?
*  100% do you want to do it again? Try it again? Just know because it could be weighted. So just or you're done. You're good
*  Yeah, you're good. Yeah, okay
*  Say a number between one and six like pick a number up to six
*  Okay, that five is what I said on the craps table, right? Yeah, but but I already know that it's a four
*  and
*  The five is here basically
*  Probably not you know, we'll do stop but stop whatever you want
*  Yeah, cuz it could be like a way to die by the way, that's how people cheat with dices
*  They also take the die and they flip it and they want it to be you know, so it's like you throw the numbers
*  So you said you wanted a five, right? Yeah
*  Good
*  That's so weird that must be a rush for you though just to blow people's minds like that all the time
*  But see so it's not you know
*  I don't think of it so what happens is the digital fixation part of like the love of just like learning something new and exciting
*  That's like really the the stimulus is like that that fixation almost
*  Like the meditative thing that you're talking about but but as a magician that is performing and trying to make TV shows
*  it's really difficult because you have to like keep coming up with new things which is
*  That's hard to do. How did you first get on television?
*  How'd you convince someone to let you try this on television?
*  Well, so back in those days the only magic that you could see and like I said
*  It was pre you couldn't go watch it or get it or any so there's no way to see magic
*  You were me with a single mother in Brooklyn or whatever how you gonna go
*  There's no magic show. I never went to a magic show
*  so
*  What happened was all those world's greatest TV?
*  Specials were playing and they were called world's greatest man and I would watch them and they were like the opposite of that
*  they were like not that they were like
*  Hard to watch, you know, it was like glossy big like dynamic and illusionist is so far away from the whole thing
*  So I'm like, there's nothing magical about all this and then um
*  so, okay, I
*  think about it and I'm like I
*  Go through up so but I'm doing magic everywhere all the time
*  So I'm one of the ways I'm making money is I'm going into those fancy restaurants in New York City
*  Like those upper Park Avenue and I do magic to the you know to the manager to this and I'm like if
*  It can I do magic to the table and it's like what I did to you there like do the magic like oh
*  That's great. I say could I do magic to the people eating and I won't ask them for anything
*  I bought like a nice suit at century 21 like a hundred dollar jacket was tacky, you know
*  But anyway, so I go up to these tables and that's a hard situation
*  Because it's very difficult to approach people that do not want you near them and try to figure out a win with magic
*  It's a cop and it's like even on the street wherever you do it
*  It's like a complicated scenario once the camera comes up it changes it because now they go. He has a camera
*  It's fine, right?
*  But you'd have to walk up to a table of a peep a bunch like us were sitting there and some like, you know
*  Sketchy magician kid right comes up to us like a can I show you card trick and you and I are gonna be like nice
*  To him probably but not really water her out
*  What I had to learn quickly was like little things that are so important like distance
*  Like how close should you be to the table or how far and then you start to really understand the psychology?
*  Of the magic is way more important than the tricks, right? So if you're too close, you're like
*  Over they don't want you near them. So you're like they're like no, thank you
*  If you're too far away, it's easy for them to say no, thank you, right?
*  So there's like a balancing point just on where you stand and then who you do the first trick to and then what the first
*  Trick is and so by doing all this I started to really figure out how to get reactions from anybody really fast
*  So I could walk up to anybody
*  anywhere and just do magic like one time I was in central booking because I jumped the subway thing and they were sweeping everybody up and
*  There was four guys sitting in the middle playing spades the only other like kid that looked like me that was in there
*  Got the shit kicked out of him, right?
*  And I'm like, I'm gonna get my ass kicked because I was with a button-up shirt like, you know
*  Anyway, so the guys are sitting in the middle that were playing spades. I grabbed it
*  I go let me show you guys something I take though
*  Come on
*  I grabbed a deck of cards and I start doing magic to the four toughest looking guys in the cell, right?
*  Within two minutes they're erupting and once they're erupting the whole everybody because it was central because you moved here
*  Everybody's standing around going nuts and then all of a sudden the guards are there and now everybody's watching together and I'm like
*  This is what the magic show needs to be
*  Whether you're like here this whether you're this that what they're young old which poor black white whatever
*  You're all wants to see it. No, no, everybody's got a good side
*  Like there's I want to show the that people are all the same, you know, like sure
*  There's some that are horrific and do horrible, but at the core of everybody
*  There's like an innocent kid somewhere. Maybe you got really far lost and magic just pulls that out of people
*  Mmm, you know and that's why and the people say well, how could you do magic?
*  I do magic to anybody because whether it's like visiting underage kids in prison that like you don't know what happens them
*  And you see them come walking up with their eyes down
*  They don't want to look at you because they don't like anybody there. That's authority, right?
*  That's what ruined their life. And then as soon as you do these tricks suddenly, they're like
*  Little happy sweet kids
*  You get you get that and that's what and that's what magic did originally to my mom
*  I go do it to her and she'd be like reacting and even if she had a terrible day, you know
*  She was working three jobs. It was a this made her happy Wow
*  That's that's a cool origin story
*  That and it makes sense that that feeling that you get like when you show so many like in you like the car trick
*  He did in the other room and everybody's like
*  That that oh the oh that you get out of people that that rush that's that that is because at that moment
*  No one's thinking of anything else at that moment. They're like what the fuck? How did you?
*  And by the way, I've walked many times when people were fighting about to erupt into big fights
*  I walked into the middle of those fights started doing magic and those fights. No, I know but and then the fights were done
*  Done everybody's like what do you want to hear the funniest non magical magic sure sure
*  Okay, so after the TV show come that stuff like that. I get more known by the way
*  So world's great city, but then I was like, okay
*  Let me do the opposite of that
*  So I called it street magic because I was trying to come up the lowest name like I was trying to come up with
*  Set the expectations as low as possible
*  because the world's greatest like
*  So I come I'm doing like card tricks, right?
*  But anyway, so I'm like driving with my friend that his what are those those smart cars in New York?
*  And it's like the coldest day in New York. It's like freezing like a February like 12 degrees out type situation and
*  We're stuck at a red light and there's a car with these four people outside of it and there you could see they're like struggling
*  Like they couldn't get the door open so they realized they and they didn't they lost their keys
*  They couldn't figure it out. They couldn't get into their car, right?
*  But I know that that's not what's going on. Like it's freezing. So I understand this is raising
*  so I could Doug stop one second and I
*  Walk up next to these this group walk up to the car pull the door open
*  But I like it made it look like I'm just pulling it but I was giving it for the door opens up
*  But it looks like I did nothing it that I get back at the car leave and I hear they go
*  That's like the best trick ever did but it was just opening up a door in a frozen night because I knew that it was just frozen
*  But that's the same as what magic is right it's like and what yeah
*  So that and the whole so that there's a book called magic and showmanship
*  Which is all about like what makes magic effective and it's called like the ham sandwich
*  He says if you just said reach in your pocket now, there's a ham sandwich. That's a good trick
*  But if you were like man, I'm hungry I would love a ham sandwich and I had already put it there and I'm like reach
*  in your pocket and then there's that's
*  Real magic so it's just context. That's where it's so baffling because then when people walk away
*  How the fuck did he know I was gonna say ham sandwich?
*  Like the folded car that you somehow another shoved into Jeff's wrist into his below his watch. We're all okay. What I
*  Mean I know there's something to it. I don't know what you're doing, but that oh
*  The result the oh is pretty pretty phenomenal, but in that moment no one's thinking of anything else
*  Yeah, but it's well sure no, but there's also a lot of people that are trying to figure it out
*  Yeah, there's all they're still going. Oh, they're not even if they're trying to figure it out
*  They're not thinking of anything other than that trick
*  Right moment something yeah, it might be trying to figure it out, but they're still they're not thinking about I gotta feed the dog
*  They're thinking about their like good friends of mine
*  I
*  Yeah, we can all get a to accustomed to things yeah
*  So you you first get on television you first do these things and then your magic?
*  Evolves and your magic goes from being just magic to some of the more insane things
*  You've done like standing in a block of ice for how long did you do it for 70 like 63 hours?
*  Always late, so I showed up late, so I missed like what the length of time are supposed to do
*  So that's all but I'm always late. I made it here on time though didn't I you were early. Yeah, yeah, perfect
*  But I wrote the motorcycle here and was flying because I had to make I wanted to be in time
*  So I flew you were on time. Yeah, um the the ice thing
*  Why would made you decide to stand in a block of ice okay?
*  60 plus hours well
*  So I'll tell you that the see you were saying how do you go from the magic tricks like to these extreme?
*  Physical endurance and so studying Houdini and all that stuff and then there's a poster of Houdini that I loved where he was it was
*  He was buried alive, but he never did the stunt
*  He died before he got to do, but he was gonna be buried alive underground in a coffin
*  So I stare it I love that poster since I was a kid. It's like in the magic books you see that poster
*  Yeah, and anyway so bill again the guy told you about Bill Kalush comes up to me
*  And he's like what about this and he shows me an image of an Indian fakir that was buried alive for a month
*  He's like what if you pretend to be buried alive in Central Park will sneak you out
*  And you'll come back a month later, and I was like I always wanted to do like Houdini like things
*  And but I never wanted to copy but that one he never did so I was kind of like well
*  That's interesting, but what if instead of doing it the way he did it
*  What if I did it and everybody could see that I was buried alive?
*  So what if I was really just buried alive like it can't be that hard
*  He's like yeah, you can't do that and I was staying at his place
*  So we got a coffin from Queens where actually Houdini was buried
*  I bought a coffin we brought it back to his house
*  And then I would just practice sleeping in the coffin then suddenly I know but then suddenly I realize you don't eat food
*  And then if you have a little thing to go to the bathroom
*  I did four days like nothing so I'm like okay
*  I can do a week and that was it and then
*  Then I pushed the idea of doing the bird alive and convinced people to let me do it publicly you know what's funny is
*  like
*  Firemen and stuff like would come to the stunt in the middle of the night
*  And they would shine like holograms at me and their lights and stuff and they oh, that's the ice
*  But and then they would assume that I wasn't actually in there okay, so here it so back to this one
*  Well, but let's go but let's not jump around so the buried alive thing. Yeah, where did you do it physically?
*  Where um that was in New York City on the west side?
*  Trump had like this bunch of properties that it was developing and
*  I was like I want to be buried alive on one of your properties is that possibly like sure
*  He just sent me his driver, and I went around and that's where I did my first stunt
*  And it was how could they see you though, and then Jimmy?
*  Who I do who like oh there is like that yeah?
*  So it was see-through, but right night, and then we put six tons of water on top of it
*  So that's basically it and then so is there and how you getting?
*  There was halt see those two big holes so the oxygen was being see the holes above my head
*  So the air was being blown in and out, but it's pretty straightforward like it that one's not to me
*  Not that impressive like if I said to you just laid there for a week
*  Yeah, but you know what the harder the hard part. I mean sure you body and the illusion
*  I was but the hard part of it is um
*  And you wouldn't you would never anticipate this being the hard part
*  But if you're not used to like peeing while standing in front of lots of people staring at you
*  It's actually really hard so so I'd be buried alive, and I had the truckers to bond and all that stuff
*  Which is like a con with a cath or whatever uh-huh and um and people are there the whole time?
*  Like it suddenly became like an event so there was never like and I was they were like oh we'll cover
*  It's no one can see I'm like no then people are gonna think I'm sneaking in and out
*  So I had to learn so I would close my eyes like when you were a kid sleeping
*  You'd have those dreams I'd have matches and it would take me hours
*  I'd finally be able to pee right but then and by the way I didn't eat for a few weeks before so I had no
*  Foods that was the other was an issue, but um what happened by midway through the stunt I'd be waving and smiling
*  And it was like nothing you know but these are things that you don't consider when you're practicing in your
*  Coffin in your house, so you you didn't eat for how long two weeks before yeah?
*  Yeah, but I was always into fasting I read Siddhartha as a kid
*  And I had done like a
*  Week with just water and you know knew all that knew the body's really good with that
*  So you were comfortable with the fact that you were able to fast and that wouldn't be an issue
*  Yeah, and you were comfortable with the fact you were getting air and where you drinking water from how you getting water?
*  Oh, I had like a little bit of water in there that I could suck through a thing like that and that was fine
*  It was like it was enough how much water you think you drank over the week that you were in there
*  I don't know they always say it was like just a little bit, but it was a good amount was like I don't know probably
*  Probably three liters a day or something okay? Yeah, they say he did tablespoons or but no it was it was it was like a normal
*  No, so was then by the way I did 44 days with nothing
*  But water and I did nothing but pure h2o
*  So it's not even like it had minerals in it and body was full recovery and my starvation
*  Expert who's like one of the top guys in the world in London my doctor at the end thought that I was cheating
*  So they put me on an IV water
*  So it's a company called h2o and their things. It's just pure. Yeah, this exactly distilled right so I had right yeah, which
*  Which is irrelevant by the way, but so I had nothing but pure h2o for 44 days lost 60 pounds
*  BMI bone mass index dropped 33%
*  Yeah, people get that's what I was yeah, no no it was bad. No. It wasn't good. Yeah, it wasn't good, but
*  Doctor thought I was cheating because he's a magician by the way my friends that were with me that are you know magicians and the guy building
*  They're like you need to take these vitamins
*  And they hand me a handful of sugary vitamins, and I'm like no it's just because I if I'm gonna do it
*  I want to like actually do it right right and um if I would have taken those vitamins
*  I feel like my metabolism wouldn't have gone into starvation and I might have had irreversible damage from it
*  So the fact that I actually did it I went into starvation mode and the body protects itself
*  That's what I was saying is the starvation expert that now I have a paper published in the New England Journal
*  Medicine with them which I'm pretty proud of but um he he didn't believe me
*  So he put me on an IV and right away the phosphate levels reacted, and I almost went into shock
*  So I almost actually did die when they refit fed me so his paper is called the refeeding syndrome
*  They say like after World War two when they rescued the from that from the camps the Jews and everybody was starving camps
*  And they a lot of soldiers gave them like candy bars and stuff and all of a sudden their systems
*  Went into shock and they died from not being refed the right way
*  So what is the correct way to refeed someone if they haven't eaten?
*  Slowly bring them back so that you don't have what happened to me was just phosphate levels go all crazy
*  So very small amounts of food yeah
*  but then two days later I somebody sent me a trunk from Harrods full of food in London like a friend and
*  And I was giving it to all the nurses and doctors because I knew I shouldn't eat it
*  And I was trying to write them like in the middle of the night
*  I woke up and had like a bag of potato chips, right and then I'm a bagel a creature
*  Right it was like the most piece I also didn't go to the bathroom for a month and a half
*  What think about that?
*  So how long does it take you to recover from one of these things?
*  That one I feel like a never fully recovered from but also I
*  Don't know I wouldn't recommend anybody does that like goes like super super long with no food
*  But but by the way so the recovery you don't think you ever recovered
*  My body always goes like this now
*  It's always confused when I like train I go up down really quick really easy, and it was since that so
*  You're like your body freaked out because I feel like yeah, I feel like that yeah, you know
*  But there's no way to prove that but that's a common thing though with people cut weight for fights really yeah
*  They get to a certain point when they have kidney failure, and yeah, yeah, and then that's what exactly that's what happened to me
*  And I keep having problems with my kidneys yes
*  Yeah, yeah, and I have a spot on my kidney right now mm-hmm yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a that's a real common one with guys Daniel
*  Cormier actually had to drop out of the Olympics because that I didn't know that his kidneys failed
*  Yeah, kidney failure is a big one with fighters kidney stones too for a lot of guys with cut weight
*  So you that was probably in your opinion the one that damaged you the most?
*  Or left the most residual so the most difficult one was the ice
*  by far the the ice was a monster and the reason why was because
*  And now there's also something great about it, so it was a warm November
*  So the air coming through was like you know it happened to be a 68 degree three day spread which led to the ice keep
*  Dripping the cold on me, and it's radiating this way
*  But I'm also standing up in one spot completely still and you can't sleep because if you fall asleep
*  I'm present ice you get frostbite you have to cut your skin off right so I'm staying completely awake the entire time
*  And it's a difficult situation on hour 55
*  Exactly or if I look back at all of it my friends knew my eyes just go out and I'm now hallucinating like
*  You could never ever there no hallucinogenic drug will ever give you those kind of hallucinations like what was it?
*  First of all it's amazing, but it's also when it goes into that nightmare part
*  It's scary
*  But there's also that amazing part of it
*  And if you have people after that stunt now whenever I hallucinate on stunts
*  I have friends there that I say I'm gonna start hallucinating just talk me through it
*  But so here's when I started realizing that I was hallucinating because you don't know when you are right
*  And by the way the one stunt I never did was sleep deprivation if you remind me I'll explain that whole thing
*  but I'll forget but so
*  So what happens is when I started realizing it is I need to know
*  Like what time it is because I'm done at 10 p.m.. Because it was live on ABC
*  So I'm like I need to know how much longer I got to go through this right because it's getting tough
*  so and it's there the glad by the way and my doorman would come and like
*  News or whatever Fox News said David Blaine is not really in the eye
*  They did a special on it an hour-long special on Fox saying that I was never in the ice
*  And I had a double of me that was in the ice
*  I'm switching up and down with them while eating burgers and reading the box
*  Fox TV station
*  Oh, yeah, so they did but they did a one-hour special that I was never in there
*  So my dormant how they get away with doing that I don't know I don't care
*  But listen so my dormant my doorman who comes to this is the funny part though
*  So my doorman that comes to see me he he's um
*  He knows me so well. He was it buried alive, and he's so nice right so he comes to visit me in New York and
*  He walks up to the ice and he sees me. He's looking at me all weird. I wasn't hallucinating it
*  So he got me all weird then he leaves it there, but I go back. I was like what's up. He's like
*  We
*  That are you sure that that was you a nice could that have been you?
*  As like what do you mean Eddie? He's like okay? Well? It's you know so he we go on
*  That special heirs now. He's convinced that it wasn't me and I especially is why you're still no no
*  That's after but he already thinks because he doesn't believe it my friends my best friends when I was buried alive
*  They didn't think I was really doing it
*  They thought it was a trick right so so he he asked me
*  He's like there's was that really you because they said that you were a double of yourself
*  And you were switching it as like Eddie, but you looked at me like
*  How could if I have a twin brother like where is that identical twin brother?
*  And why why would I switch up so anyway?
*  But it's so back to the back to the when I get to 55 hours
*  So I'm looking around and I need the time so I go like this
*  Like what time is it and the guy goes?
*  402 yeah, so he shows me 402
*  So I'm like okay. That means we have like another six hours or whatever it is right by the way my time estimations
*  Are so I'm like okay wait. It might have been too. Oh wait wait wait wait
*  And I wait, and I'm in door. It's hard. I'm like things are moving
*  Everything's weird spiders walking up people are like sitting in the ice
*  I'm waiting waiting voices are talking to me that I'm talking back to right, but I'm waiting
*  I'm waiting and I wait for like a few hours
*  before I ask anybody the time again, I
*  see somebody I'm like
*  And the guy and the guy goes
*  Four oh three oh
*  And
*  That's when it all crashed out
*  It was like when that when I that connection and then the hallucinations were just rampant and my eyes were all crazy when the
*  Drill was when the chainsaw was coming through I tried to grab it. Yeah, so yeah see look at that. Oh, you're gone
*  But okay, but so but now that I've learned that sleep deprivation is one of the most
*  Amazing ways if it's controlled to go to another place, it's like that
*  But I want to get to that before we get to that like while you're in there
*  What are you doing to occupy your mind like how are you did you have?
*  Were you using meditation were you just thinking were you just winging it like so okay?
*  So for some of them what I do a big first of all yeah a lot of things you get to your free time to think like
*  There's no phones no distraction, so
*  Aside from the physical but but the one thing that I use with everything is kind of like a breakdown of numbers
*  I'm like okay this much I have to get to this point then when I get to this point even when I run on a treadmill
*  I'm like okay have to get to this point which means let me get to the halfway point
*  I'll consider that when I'm holding my breath. I do same thing like okay. I need to get to 15 minutes
*  So let me get to seven and I'll start at seven then at seven. I'm like okay. I'm at seven left
*  I have to get to another three and a half and three and a half and then what I always do is whenever I'm training
*  I always go past it, so it's the same thing so like when I'm running a treadmill
*  I'm like if I have to do let's say like you know
*  3.1 whatever it is I set that as my target
*  But then I always go like another half a mile past it because I won't you can't quit before because then you'll be in
*  The mindset that okay
*  I can stop before so like anything that I do I use numbers to get there I get halfway
*  And then I push the goal further every single time no matter what hmm
*  Which is so it's a mathematical system ironically
*  So you're you're you don't necessarily have any sort of meditative techniques. You're just concentrating on the numbers meditation for breath-holding all the time
*  Right every time I do a breath
*  Now the ice was kind of there was like a breathing thing and I didn't really know much about it back then
*  But I was like more like fighting it like what is it like on your ankles or your knees and your back?
*  Everything swells up like a demon really bad and all that stuff and the pain is excruciating and unbearable
*  But yeah, I mean you're waiting and you didn't have any residual effects of that just my
*  Ankles and legs were really swollen just for a few days or so longer than that, but yeah, yeah
*  Now has anybody ever tried to break that I?
*  Don't know I hope not and then not cuz I want I don't care about how I just don't anybody hurt themselves
*  But I would imagine like someone does something so high-profile like you did that that people would be like hmm
*  I'm gonna try that I
*  Mean I think it's too weird so people aren't really like oh I want to do that
*  There's billions of people I would imagine that someone would step in and try to emulate that obviously was so I pray not and that's why
*  I pray my daughter never becomes a magician even though she's so amazing at it because if she started doing these things
*  I like if she's gonna bump her knee of like I have a heart attack
*  Yeah, the things that make you amazing are your ability to overcome adversity and then you shelter your children from adversity
*  It's all my favorite people are all they all came from a very tumultuous childhood
*  They all came from like turmoil and no one wants that for their child you want to protect your children. Yeah
*  Weird it's very weird. So what are the ones have you done where like?
*  While you were doing it you were thinking what the fuck have I done?
*  Because you committed there was one that don't go don't pull this one up don't pull this one
*  It was called the dive of death and I started to get cocky. I done like the thing in London
*  I've done like the water tank. I've done so I started to get too cocky, right?
*  I didn't have time and ABC wanted to show really quick. I was like, okay. I'm gonna go upside down for
*  60 minutes and I was like, okay
*  And ABC wanted to show really quick I was like, okay, I'm gonna go upside down for
*  60 hours three days whatever right I was gonna be upside down and then um
*  And then I some guy was in a parachute upside down on a tree in Italy and he was in the hospital because he was
*  Three days upside down in the tree and I was trying to speak to him, but he was like not
*  Didn't want to talk at all and then they were like it's his situations really bad
*  So it kind of like set the tone before I did the thing
*  Situations really bad like that from being upside down for that long what happened to him?
*  I think he's the blood I think it I think it does I
*  Don't know cuz he didn't I didn't get to ask they wouldn't tell me but he wouldn't also engage in a it was bad
*  That I know it was like in the news. It was bad
*  I don't know what the permanent repercussion but so when I did this thing upside down in New York, I didn't practice it
*  I thought I could just wing it my stunk guy who taught me to jump off the pole
*  He's like you can never ever just go wing something and not dial it in and rehearse and figure it out
*  You can't just go do it. It's a you'll you can't hope for luck
*  And that was the first one ever and last one that I was like, okay
*  Let me just hope that I can do this as soon as I went upside down remember
*  I said you could never prepare for certain things
*  Yeah, I had that catheter hooked up and the first time I peed it just went upside down all over me
*  So this way and I was like I'm done. So the whole stunt went down over there
*  That was like that was a great learning lesson because I learned you never just dial it it
*  Don't you make it through that one? Yes, but it was terrible
*  It was a garbage stunt is but you were asking me like what things so that was one that was like, oh
*  You're but all the others that they were amazing the team that working with the best people all of it
*  And this one is the most amazing like I have a team that's the one you're doing right now
*  I have the most amazing I've never been able to have a team like this ever. Yes
*  Okay, explain this. Okay, so I went to YouTube with crazy idea who by the way, this is YouTube and they've been a blessing
*  Beyond beyond so I'm like, okay
*  Here's what I want to do like I want to grab a bunch of balloons and go floating up into the sky and disappear
*  Like okay, great. Okay, sure
*  But so now I need it to ascend. This is all hypothetical
*  I'm not like a skydiver like that has a thousand or ten thousand or twenty thousand jump. I'm not a balloon pilot
*  I have no experience in any of this stuff
*  I just know that I want to do this and I've wanted to do it forever
*  But I I had drawings of it made fifteen years ago
*  But now you have to get for real
*  So there is a guy that flies balloons and there's a guy like lawn chair Larry that went up on balloons with like a lawn
*  Chair and a bunch of beer that was his balance and he like pop balloons with a guy
*  So
*  There are examples. So it's not like a complete hypothetical this one has like, okay
*  So what if I could take the balloons that idea and just have the innocent image of a kid like we all dream of just
*  Holding the balloons and drifting up and into the sky here. I'll show you
*  What's that what's that one from
*  From whose website is that Jamie?
*  Right, so that's that's my balloons
*  Is that you up there? Yeah. Yeah, we did. Um, we did short flights not big in public. We kept it small
*  Can I show these to Jamie?
*  No, I don't know
*  Yeah to him and I can show
*  Can show I'm not sure and then don't wait. That's my balloons. Yeah. Oh, well that's on but that that's the end
*  I'm doing it. Yeah, right
*  But anyway, so
*  So, okay, so it starts with just the idea of that
*  But now I have to go get a hot air balloon pilot license. So I go meet with the best hot air balloon pilot
*  instructor and also flyer
*  Isn't that the different situation on a hot air balloon because you don't have the ability to control you have to first get your hot air
*  Balloon pilot license so you have to learn how to fly and land the balloon, which is amazing, right?
*  It's like so app and then you have to take that written test and I don't have time because I'm trying to do so much
*  Well, so I had to cram study the whole written test in eight hours with a guy helping me
*  I studied the whole thing went to the airport took the test got that then you need to go get your gas restriction lifted
*  Which means cuz and very few people even ever bothered to do this because who's flying hydrogen or helium nowadays
*  So I went and met this guy Burt Padel who's the best gas balloonist in the world
*  He's the one that built around the world in 80 days
*  He's built every balloon that's done the longest flights and you fly now a hot air balloon. You're like
*  Right, you have to control it and it's
*  helium and hydrogen
*  You're just part of the wind
*  You're literally just floating away and it'll keep going up to
*  84,000 feet until they pop there like you are just floating like I
*  Can't explain that feeling of floating
*  anyway, so I had to go learn how to fly and land hydrogen balloons and
*  Use hydrogen because helium is more expensive and stuff like that now
*  We have to go test the whole rig. So now
*  And at the same time I have to also try to get as close to 500 jumps out of an airplane
*  Because I need to be really comfortable in the air if I have to jump out and land I need to land safely
*  Right and when you're up at 25 plus thousand feet, you don't know where you are, right?
*  So yeah, so now and by the way the video did you see the video I made for you?
*  You didn't see it. No, you made a video for me
*  Yeah, because when you did the thing with post and you were good and post was like he's not real and you were defending me
*  I was like, um
*  Hold on I made a video I sent it to Matt I texted him I didn't get a video
*  He didn't show it to you video. No, hold on. I made you this video
*  So this is me yelling from the plane and by the way, this is after the wingsuit guys jump out of the airplane
*  So remember I'm also
*  Crushing lots of jumps really fast
*  This is when I ran into a fence and almost killed myself and the Luke who's the best in the world that has 25,000
*  More jumps jumped from 25,000 feet without a parachute and landed in a net. I saw that. Yeah, so he's the guy coaching me
*  so he's the one filming this and
*  He landed at the state troopers patrol thing because we were so far lost and I ended up trying to make it back
*  Almost hitting the trees really really close and then crashing into a fence
*  My legs are all bloodied up ripped through the thing flipped over landed. I was fine. That was recent
*  And the reason why is because I was making you this video I complete true
*  But I'm gonna explain it to you to make the video
*  I had to wait till the wingsuits were out of the plane because they're last right
*  But that means and by the way the conditions you'll see what they were like in a second
*  So the plane's moving really really far away, right?
*  Because it's still going that means the drop zone is way over there
*  Well, I made the video and it was longer than I said
*  And then when we jump we're like lost in the clouds and I see the only hole so I fly through the hole and now
*  Because I flew through that hole
*  We're so far away from everything and I should have followed Luke and went to the state patrol thing
*  But I was like no, I'm gonna make it just back and but so here's the video. I made you though
*  Can we play it for other people? Yeah, why don't you airdrop it to Jamie? Oh, yeah
*  Okay
*  Hair drop isn't that funny though? It's pretty wild
*  But you don't you bummed out that I didn't get this before oh well
*  Yep, so I was gonna like post it or something
*  I asked him if I should and he's like well wait cuz maybe you'll just do the show
*  So I think that's why he didn't maybe or something. Mm-hmm
*  Maybe it got lost in the email or something it might have gotten to one of those
*  That the email dumps get pretty big sometimes the point where I can't keep up is it young James
*  Okay, so that's that one but then I'm gonna show you the rest of the shot
*  but you might have to scroll through it to get to it, but um
*  I'll show you but by the way, it's the most amazing thing
*  So I'll show you the rest of that shot and then you'll see where he landed and where I landed
*  I'm gonna send you first the pretty version of it you guys can like cut through or whatever
*  Sure. Okay. Yeah, so I'm gonna edit. I'm gonna just send you like the full and then you'll look through
*  So here's another one
*  When is this one supposed to be in two weeks two weeks
*  Yeah, and do you have to take any consideration the wind the like what what the car? Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, that's why we can't like confirm a location because we determine everything
*  Yeah, so even though now it like, you know almost 400 jumps the wind still decide where you go. Oh here
*  All right. Here we go
*  Well, that's the first one so we I can come back sure, okay, okay check this out
*  Oh
*  Jesus Christ, okay, but so you see the clouds now. Hold on this one's gonna come
*  So you're hanging on to a plane how high are you there? No, that was just sound
*  13,000 nothing no, but I went to know that I went to 25. I know I remember you tell me yeah
*  Yeah, but still but that's 13,000 feet off the air hanging on to a plane and you jump off
*  Maybe it's another one. Maybe it's this one
*  It's hilarious that you're like, oh, it's only 13,000 feet
*  Hang on to the wing of a plane and then I let go on video. I
*  Know but you need to see that I can I can't play it here though, right and show you like this
*  We have to air job because it's going air job is better because of first going slow
*  Why just want to send this one that shows like how spectacular but I could just
*  Explain what's going on? So hold on now which one because there's three young James
*  Now when you decide to do something like this do you get an inspiration and then you
*  consult people to see if it's feasible like
*  Like well, so so that's where I was lucky
*  So the thing is I come up with the idea and then I find a guy his name is Jonathan trap
*  he's the one that tried to cross the Atlantic with healing for balloons and
*  But I mean he has it's like a full system. He has a basket
*  So it's like a real balloon like a hot air balloon system with so nobody's ever done it where they just
*  Float where their bodies are the basket, you know, I mean
*  So he had the whole system and then he came and tested out and I was like, could I go try it like this?
*  And he's like no, we're not ready. You'll kill yourself or whatever. You're hanging on to the rope
*  Yeah, but I'm gonna make sure that I'm not gonna have a parachute on and I'm gonna I'll have a system
*  So I'm completely secure
*  So I'm not gonna fall off
*  But I'm not gonna wear the parachute because I don't want to be I want it to look like a kid just holding on to
*  Balloons so like that visuals the important part. So the parachutes up in the balloons, but once I get above like a
*  A
*  Thousand feet or so. I'm gonna put the parachute on oh
*  So you're gonna put the parachute on while you're up there. Yeah, and then I want to see if how high I can go
*  see
*  You can go well
*  So the highest thing on earth is Mount Everest, right?
*  so that's kind of my goal, but I have to be careful because if you if you if you don't come back down your
*  So if you can't get down from there, that's that zone is like the death zone. So from like
*  25,000 to 30,000 is very very dangerous. You can blackout like this. So
*  I'm gonna do a couple more hypoxic tests and see if I'm right
*  I'll have emergency stuff up there like oxygen if I need it
*  But I don't want to go around with you up there in the balloons. Yeah, we have like the
*  I
*  Wait, it's not dude your loved ones panic when you start plotting things like this. My daughter asks questions
*  How old is she nine and she has great questions and that the plate the tail number the plate is for me and her so it's
*  And for number but nine for her age 47 for my age and then DB for me and her were both
*  dessa and David Blaine but um, which is the balloon that has I
*  Made this has to be a registered aircraft. So we had to get it registered. We had to fly it up
*  We had to prove that it's completely safe. We had to land it with nobody on it. So the body
*  One time that I went wasn't me. It was sand that weighed exactly what I weighed
*  We had to remote dump the sand we had to use squibs to remote pop the balloons fly it over and this is at
*  22,000 feet and fly it. What is what is control?
*  But is it radio yeah
*  Okay, I have the whole team helping me that did like Alan useless when he jumped and Felix Bumgartner when he jumped from the edge
*  Of space so we have Don day the best meteorologist
*  So you do they have to weigh you before you get on it's exactly precision
*  And then so we had to fly it all the way up to 22,000 feet as proof that this aircraft is actually
*  Completely doable and then remote land it exactly where Don day predicted we were gonna land it
*  We've done that multiple times. We've flown it we've deployed the the imitation
*  Time involved in constructing one of these things and orchestrating it
*  Time and team and yeah team is everything
*  so it'd be like you when you have like the best trainers if you had like your
*  Five best in the world like tweaking you before fights like that
*  So when when you plan on doing something like this did you bring this up to these folks
*  These are the first people the people that you're doing it with these are the people that you brought it up to the first time
*  Yeah, nobody said get the fuck out of here with this
*  No went straight to YouTube and I was like I have these guys and they hesitate at all
*  No, they're they're amazing that that's crazy. That's one of them
*  Right. It is also crazy. It's just a hypothetical idea. That's insane
*  Yeah, true and they did let me like but there were stages I had to prove each step
*  So I had to prove that number one the balloon is doable number two
*  I'm not gonna hopefully kill myself number three
*  I can actually get the job and then for the skydives by the way
*  Because I had to get 500 jumps really quick and this is all during the last year, right?
*  So insurance wouldn't cover that. I mean they would cover but it's not affordable
*  So I had to do five almost five hundred four hundred jumps or so with no insurance
*  So that's a whole separate thing that's not related
*  So I had to go do them from my own as fun and do everything through my own
*  So crazy, it's all nuts because and because you think of skydiving think like oh you have the best coach
*  It's fine, but there's still like when you're trying to do 15 jumps a day. It's like you can
*  Do what I did which is try to avoid hitting an airplane in a hanger and turn too low come whacking down
*  I'm like did you come up with this idea?
*  I
*  Mean, I think it was like inspired when I was a kid
*  I think like the idea of like the little boy drifting right balloon
*  So I think it was like but I never really thought of it as a reality
*  But then 15 years ago or so I had drawings made of it. So I started having draw
*  I'll show you the drawings. I can't open it on there. Whatever. So when did you put it into motion?
*  Like it was never even possible until YouTube said okay, we'll back this because the idea is like all of my other stunts
*  There's like the budgets pretty very you know, you couldn't afford to do something like this
*  This is to build test the flight build an actual aircraft fly it land it
*  Get all the jumps learn how to do everything get all the skill set have this in so this is but that's the first drawing
*  Oh, wow. Yeah
*  So you drew this when you were I didn't draw it someone else did yeah Mark Stutzman
*  Who's an amazing artist that did my poster for this thing, which I'll show you so that I send this to Jamie
*  Yeah, it's not working but you can try a job not working
*  I can but maybe the picture will go if not, I can restart the phone and maybe it'll work
*  Was it shown up for you Jamie no, right, let me restart the phone there's a lot of okay now it says it's waiting
*  There's like so many macbook pros, yeah, yeah, there's three of oh it went yeah
*  Okay, then I'll also send oh but wait so shy also show you the poster that I had made which is okay
*  So you you come to YouTube powerful YouTube they come up with this I mean they
*  That's the original but this is the latest one so you send that one Tim too
*  Yeah, I'll send it to you Jamie
*  It's coming through it now supposedly
*  I have to accept them for some reason doesn't just go
*  Is it showing up for you? No, I think I should restart the phone because those videos too. I want to send
*  Okay, how did you get it to go though? Which one did you press? I don't know. There's so many of them doesn't make any sense
*  Your phone is being monitored by the government. They're cloning
*  Hold on. I want to try to send this video so I could explain making your video if that's possible
*  But
*  Did when you oh now it's preparing it so now it's beautiful
*  Now it's going through you have it coming right now
*  Because it says it's converting so it might be coming
*  Okay
*  So you bring this to YouTube on how long ago was it
*  Like a year and a half ago or something they say yeah, let's do it. We're fucking crazy
*  Yeah, and also it's probably gonna have a hundred million people watch it so it seems
*  I don't know. I don't know about that. Oh, I do. Yeah, I don't know float around in a fucking balloon
*  I don't know if that's true
*  I'll bet on it, but this one by far is my favorite that I've ever done
*  It's the most visual the most colorful and it's the first one that I've ever done where my friends are like I want to do that
*  They're not like why do you do that?
*  But you know all the other sense I do people are like like that's it's great that you're doing it
*  But that's crazy or why you doing it this one. They're like I want to ride the balloons
*  Because it's such a childhood yeah
*  It'll be like that wow that's pretty cool, so it'll look just like that and how is it are you harnessed?
*  it's like a yeah, it'll be like a little thing that connects at my wrist which like the way the
*  Aerialists have a connection. I'll have a connection to your body your torso somehow. Yeah, it'll be connected somewhere crotch
*  Yeah, hopefully like a nightmare something yeah, because when you get up to like minus
*  You know 20 degrees or whatever you'll be non-functional up there, so right you can't just rely
*  Well, you can't really rely on your hand no I no no no I no no I was practice
*  I if I had to do this up to like you know two to three thousand feet I could because you holding on yeah
*  Yeah, you can ascend you can also do what you know just put something around your foot like the the wires could come down
*  Okay, so something around your foot would just take away. It's to help yes
*  Yeah, do well right and then and then how long can you actually hang though like I mean?
*  It's really hard to hang more than a couple of minutes. It's hard to hang for more than a minute
*  I think like the record is like two minutes, but what I'd want and you yeah with one hand
*  But this has to look the whole that this has to look like the one-handed right of the person floating
*  He has to be exact so right you'd have to some freaky. Yeah, I'm Popeye
*  Yeah, so I'll have assistance built, but so I won't have a parachute or any of that stuff
*  That'll be above me, so it'll look really clean
*  But I'll be supported now if there's a balloon failure or something like that obviously I'm in trouble
*  Obviously but once I get the parachute on once I get to 5,000 feet then we know okay
*  He's not gonna die. He has a parachute on I can get away and now the big challenge is how high can you go?
*  So once you get how are you gonna know do you have an altimeter on the I'll have an altimeter, but I'm also gonna have a
*  Communication okay full everything okay, I'm gonna have cameras with me for the using a watch for the altimeter
*  Like what do you use well? I'm using this one called the kunu right now, but it's big so sure no
*  But I was I've been jumping with suuntoes and things just to check
*  How accurate they are and they're not bad?
*  They're like off by like 200 feet or something like that mm-hmm, but on the landing you don't want to be off
*  You know especially if you're like me you don't even you only have 400 jumps not even right right
*  So and you're landing in dicey areas because you don't know where you are right so gust of wind can throw you here or there
*  Anything, but you also have to like not hit a power line or a building or an obstacle or anything wherever you are
*  Right if you like if you come down into a mountain you're gonna whack into that it looks flat from here
*  But if you didn't adjust you're gonna come in hard, and that's it you'll eat it right if you hit a power line
*  You're dead, so yeah those types of things we have to like and which is why?
*  When I'm controlling balloons and going up and up and up and up and up
*  I'm gonna
*  Hopefully be fine hopefully
*  Scaring the shit out of me already so at 5,000 feet you how do you get the parachute?
*  It's up there and the balloons, and I'm gonna pull it down
*  It's on like a fishing wire thing I pull it down and then I put it on that's the only like really difficult thing
*  As have you done this already you've practiced that aspect I've pressed it and that's like really scary to everybody around oh
*  Yeah, they're asking me. Why won't I just wear the thing like everybody? Yeah, they're like you you have to wear it
*  And you don't want to wear it and my brother's really obsessed with it my daughter's new question is how come you're not wearing the parachute
*  But I'm but I'm telling her it's fine
*  But you haven't have you done this transition yet where you go from floating to putting the parachute on no
*  That'll be done live the first time oh
*  This whole thing will be done the first time live, and I've never done it in completion
*  I've done all the elements of it, so I've done the jumps. I've done the balloon flights
*  I've flown the rig, but I've never put it all together. That's all gonna happen for the first time
*  And so once you get the the vest on once you get the the parachute on then the goal is to see how high you can
*  Get up yeah, and once you get part that I'm obsessed with when you get to the area of 30,000 plus feet
*  No, no, you can't cross there. I mean I just want to get the goal is if I get up to like
*  Twenty five thousand feet I'm excited okay, because that's where the ice I want to disappear like I actually want the visual to be that
*  I disappear into the sky
*  Okay, so you get up to 25, but I'm not gonna kill myself doing it
*  I hope not I won't okay. I believe you, but this one is different than I have the O2 things by the way
*  You can't send the O2 pulse oximeter signals down, so they won't know if I'm hypoxic, but I'm gonna have the O2 monitors in my pocket
*  I'm gonna put them on I'm gonna show them to the camera they can still communicate with you
*  Yeah, now if they can't that's a big issue so if communication fails
*  Then this is for me communication is done through what?
*  RF this this incredible guy that builds all the communication for every skydiving stun movie
*  So he's the same way that a plane can communicate with the ground
*  Yeah, yeah, it's something yeah, and I have I have a transponder up here. I have everything so the planes
*  I'm visible everybody knows where I am
*  Clearing everything with the FA the ATC so everything is gonna be you know completely organized as it needs to be we have a wind
*  Path in every location that we're gonna possibly do this in of course
*  New York is a dream and there's some other dreams that we have so you know this is still we have a couple of
*  key points that we're dreaming about doing this and
*  Depending on wind and weather that's where we'll do it, and how do you get how do you descend?
*  Um
*  Just let go of some yeah, just completely
*  Yeah, so you're gonna skydive at 25,000 feet
*  Yeah
*  by the way when I did when I did the I told you when I did that a test when I went up to 20 almost
*  24-7 or whatever I had the the helmet on the first breath
*  I took the entire thing was ice right away, so and I was flying down looking through like a little hole in the hell
*  I'm gonna home it. Yeah, I couldn't see
*  Jesus Christ and
*  so
*  When you land you have to land I mean you're from 25,000 feet you have to make sure that you're conscious
*  You have to make sure that you can see that's right, but usually by the way even if you are hypoxic and you're dropping
*  You clear up at like 10,000 feet so Luke Aikens the who you watch
*  he did a jump once where he was jumping with Felix Baumgartner who we trained and
*  He was um out of he was hypoxic he was blacked out
*  But when he got to about 9,000 feet or so he woke up and then from yeah
*  But from 9,000 feet down you have you know 40 seconds to figure out where you are and what you're doing
*  Okay
*  It still seems fucking terrifying
*  And so then you're you're floating down and you have to find a good spot to land
*  And when are you gonna do this like what's the official launch date is it August 31 100% depending on wins depending on when
*  So the winds are fucked on August 31st
*  Exactly, and that's the other thing YouTube's been amazing on there. It is David Blaine ascension YouTube originals August 31st
*  Yeah, that's basically what I love that YouTube stepped up to do this
*  Yeah, it is amazing. It is amazing look at you floating above the cloud in that image, and that's literally what you're gonna be doing
*  That's so fucked
*  but also the thing about this one aside from like the technical part of it is like
*  The visual on it so far is my favorite one yeah
*  It's like up like when they do yeah
*  But when I look at the balloons I become like giddy like in all these adults are working
*  We're all like laughing cuz we're like little we're like kids
*  You know it's like it's iconic. It's something that every kid has kind of thought of yeah
*  Yeah, grabbing a balloon and floating away like Mary Poppins. Yeah
*  Yeah, wow man, and that was my daughter's nickname when she was growing up
*  But we called Mary the real Mary Poppins
*  She was a real Mary Poppins and we put a balloon up and we'd always watch it and dream and talk about where it goes
*  And stuff like that
*  What is it like for her to when you discuss things these things? She's so am I I run ideas by her? She's a really yeah
*  She's amazing by the way the reason there's pink balloons in this one is because I was showing her all the balloons
*  They're gonna be pink and I was like of course there's gonna be fake and now there's fake
*  Wow
*  now you have you been doing live shows this whole time or you are you able to with co-not during COVID no but right up to
*  code I was doing live and that I
*  Haven't been promoting there anything, but it's like my favorite thing because I've been working on the live show for
*  20 some years and I've never done one until like the last few years like started like
*  Three years ago is the first time I did that
*  Which is crazy, right? Yeah
*  But I finally felt like I had the right material to make a good show and the show is so
*  It's so it's like I open it with the mouth sewing so the first thing is like it but I bring people up
*  So it's also comical. It's like funny right like joking around something you see people like that
*  Yeah, when you say mouth sewing you actually sew your mouth. Yeah. Yeah, and you do that at how many nights a week one?
*  No, so I so I would do two days on one day off
*  But every day of a show it means you can't eat for 36 hours before the show because I also have to
*  Put a gallon of water in my stomach. I have to put a cup of kerosene
*  But now I don't swallow the kerosene. I put it in my mouth down spit it
*  So I don't swallow but on Jimmy Jimmy Kimmel. I drank this stuff and it's like really really that's how the guy died
*  Haji Ali that told you so now I just put it in the mouth spit it
*  See and then I do the frogs in the stomach I put the hanger all the way down the throat to fetch somebody's ring
*  I um I do the breath. I do the breath hold every single night and
*  And then and then I push the eye and then I have them push an ice pick through my arm every night
*  Which is like you don't want to hit a break you know anything
*  Yeah, or an artery or anything of course so but I and I let them choose a spot by the way
*  Also brought the ice pick if you do do want to see cuz I I know that you know it's real
*  But I should oh, I believe it's real, but I still you wanna see it
*  Really yeah itching to do it
*  I'd like you to do it just to see that it is like pretty straightforward
*  Oh, I believe it's straightforward, but I brought one with me, and I got the alcohol from the so here is
*  Leave that girl
*  And so you're stitching that's exactly yeah
*  But so see that so what I was able to do with the stage show is I bring people up on stage
*  And I have the cameras with the big screen so you see people reacting to this stuff
*  So it's the magic plus the reaction so you get that whole and this girl's really into it look at her
*  So you do this all the time the stitching the mouth shut
*  I would imagine you would accumulate some scar tissue now that one's easy, but this one's legit this one
*  I used to do it through the hand
*  This one I used to do through the hand and I developed so much scar tissue that like when I move my fingers a certain
*  Way I get a shooting pain, so I stopped doing the hands and I switched to here mmM. That makes sense
*  Yeah, I would I would imagine that would really fuck your hands up
*  So wait, but so I might have to sit next to you or something do you want me to do this to you?
*  Is this what's going on here? Yeah, I can come over to your side, okay
*  Okay, all right, but wait don't you need the or you can put those on I'll just come walk over
*  If I take the thing off
*  We'll both be basically talking into the same no, but we can do it sitting yeah, but can you put those ones on yeah?
*  Jim now this mic work okay, Jim will turn this mic on
*  Okay, so you want the left or the right let's do the right since it's right next to me
*  Okay, do you want them to come in and see it as well? No good enough, okay, so now
*  This is not a new ice pick and usually I do with new ones
*  Which means this isn't as sharp as it needs to be so it means the push is gonna be a little more difficult
*  I guess why do you like to do this seems to be your are these ones that she gives these pure alcohol?
*  Yes, yes
*  I
*  Mean they're just the standard ones you get it's fine. I'm sure yeah
*  Yeah, well you want to make sure there's no scent in it or anything. I want to make sure that there is no bacteria right?
*  But I mean on the alcohol strip. Oh, yeah
*  Why do you enjoy this you seem you're excited about this well first of all it's amazing that you can actually do something like this
*  Like it's nothing so there's a guy named Mir and Dio. Can you pull up Mir and Dio you think so Mir and Dio?
*  It's this guy and nobody believed he was doing it for real and he would take
*  Rapiers and he would have them push through it right through the middle of his body
*  His lungs and everything he would show on all sides, and then they would pull him out
*  And he'd be perfectly fine he and every every doctor and saying oh you can't do that
*  But so remember when Steve Irwin died you know why he died
*  No, because he pulled the stingray thing out of his heart the stingray
*  He pulled it out right crocodile
*  So if he kept it in there he would have lived right after that a 70 year old man was on his boat and a stingray
*  Jumped up out of the water stung him in the heart and then stingray was gone
*  But though I didn't even yeah
*  Yeah, look at that isn't that crazy?
*  But the fact that you can actually do this is what's crazy like the body can
*  With your mind you can override it
*  And then the thing is he got so cocky though that he thought he could do anything
*  And then he ate one of these things he swallowed it and killed him internally died
*  But see he got really cocky with because he was like I could do anything
*  That is fucking insane
*  Is he going through his liver he can go through anything and that's what I'm saying so the 70 year old guy
*  That got the stingray to it stabbed him in the heart
*  Instead of pulling it out which it's like a corkscrew
*  He waited till they with doctors till it beat out the other side, and he was fine
*  You see wow
*  So instead of pulling it out he waited until what happened the doctors waited and with the heart
*  They let it beat out the other side, and they slowly let it come out it went through his whole body
*  They could if they would have pulled it. It's like a corkscrew would rip him apart
*  He would die how long did it take for it to beat through?
*  But I know that the doctors what they did is they let it go through
*  How many times this guy get stabbed like that one by the way right there
*  That's a safe place. That's like not an issue, but when you go through the lungs and stuff. It's crazy
*  Look, it's great, but this is too much. I don't show it's too like too much fucking sword man
*  But that's what's like that one listen. He's
*  But so what happened was he started to get too cocky he started to think he was fine
*  But okay, so Joe but if it listen to the origin of this trick though, that's not a trick
*  No, but I know but listen so the origin of this is as a kid
*  There's that trick where they do needle through arm yes, right and it's like the rubber some you know the stuff
*  And it sticks your skin together looks perfect
*  Looks like it's really through your arm, and then they like squeeze blood out of the thing they pray
*  So I saw that and then I was like but maybe that's like actually doable like maybe that trick could really be done
*  So like the same exact trick, but for real
*  Right so that's this okay, okay?
*  So you take that okay?
*  Like I said it's gonna be a little tricky to push through just because the it's usually sharp in this time
*  It's not as sharp, but how do you know where to do it?
*  We're gonna pick there's no
*  How do I know I'm not gonna hit an artery that I don't know I can't kill you
*  So you want me just right here anywhere sure what's where do you prefer?
*  Like right there well sure no, but I yeah do it there where you want do it where you when you say well sure
*  I swear do you like it to go through the bottom like no I liked where you were going right?
*  I mean, that's that's fine, but you're gonna go like through
*  Well, what do you want me to do? Yeah, you're gonna push through okay?
*  So hold on you here. Yeah, keep like a straight path
*  Okay, like that no it goes true like that. Yeah, I'd go straight through yeah, okay ready slowly and go slow
*  Yeah
*  You're listening see that yep see
*  So it's hard to believe that it's real you keep pushing keep going
*  Keep going
*  Wait oh
*  Hold on
*  Whoo what happened?
*  Yeah, but what if I fuck your arm up man, and then you can't hang from the balloon and then YouTube's mad at me
*  Okay
*  Okay, okay
*  Okay, so by the way honest to God I never go in this direction
*  I which way to go I always go this direction why inside to out
*  I'm just saying of like that of the all the times. I did it. I've always gone this direct
*  Do you want me to go that direction? I'm just telling I've never got better no, so what's the difference?
*  I'm just saying I've never done it this okay, so it's a groundbreaking
*  No, I'm saying it's nuts looks definitely nuts
*  I'll hold my ears again, okay good no, but from the bottom like this like that
*  Yeah, and then I go again, and I would I would try to go like a straight path through like right there
*  No, I would go like lower and in like just like that
*  Yeah, okay, yeah, I'd go like that and keep hold on
*  Wait wait push
*  Yeah, like that like that that's good
*  Yep, we're on a clean path. We hit something, but it's fine now
*  It's something that's this I use the skin here, and I push so you can see it come through push
*  That's it see all righty
*  Super unnecessary
*  But it does seem like a magic trick it definitely doesn't seem like a magic trick
*  Definitely doesn't seem like a magic trick to me, but hold on there's blood vessels and everything yes, there's no blood well
*  It's a very small hole in comparison to it's no it's a good sign there is blood on the other hole
*  Yeah
*  And your body's healthy, so it's clotting out pretty quickly okay, I'm sure I put it out
*  That's it okay
*  So here this is for you to keep I
*  Can't say I enjoyed that that was very uncomfortable
*  But it's weird to me more than anything is that you seem to enjoy it
*  You enjoyed the freak out well you know I like what I said
*  I like that you can override your body with your brain to do things that seem like they're not real
*  Yeah, it doesn't seem you know it's real because of what you do to your body
*  But most people see all the things they do and think it's a magic trick right they think it's a trick like okay
*  It's a trick if he's not holding his breath, and you've done that thing with a sword. Well. You've gone through your body
*  Yeah, but it was not very thick and it was through right here
*  I didn't go okay, so you can go through the organs like this guy did no, but but I think you can I
*  Obviously he did it right and swallowing this is what killed him
*  So he got really he thought he could do anything
*  So he's like I'm gonna swallow this type of thing and then I'm gonna bring it up
*  He swallowed it, and he couldn't bring it up, and then he fell asleep, and it ruptured his heart
*  He woke up. They found him cold. Oh boy internal bleeding
*  I
*  That is the thing about these extreme feats right is that you're you possibly might be pushing the boundaries of what's physically possible
*  Which means you could die like Houdini like Houdini died from getting punched yeah in the stomach
*  Yeah, how does a punch to the stomach kill you well so normally like I had Kimbo slice punch me in the stomach
*  Did you really yeah ouch? Yeah, and then I had him do it again, and then I felt bad
*  I don't want to make him keep doing it because it wasn't you know right because you guys you know you can train to take
*  A punch yes, obviously so I basically had my trainer rich Beretta throw
*  Heavy balls kick me in the stomach do everything and I trained for a long like a year just to take a punch from anybody
*  And oh yeah, how's Kimbo boom? Oh?
*  And then I said to him do it again, so and by the way
*  I'm not even in top physical so I said do it again, and then I but I could obviously could have kept going so
*  And I did that based on Houdini right right so but here's the thing so Houdini
*  Would do this on stage every night, and it's a it's a great thing in the show
*  it's like look bah-bah every any ten strongest people in the audience come punch him and
*  So the end these kids think he's invisible invincible right like he could like this is Houdini man of steel whatever right
*  So he's sleeping in his dressing room these two college kids one kids like watch how strong and they punch Houdini in the stomach
*  Really while asleep yes, and and as you know that's dangerous because you don't have a wall up
*  So he ruptured something, but he's a workaholic so the guy is in a lot of pain whether he might maybe it wasn't related
*  Maybe it's something different. Maybe he had you know appendicitis who knows right? He's in a lot of pain, but he wouldn't let the audience down
*  So he wouldn't quit his show so he did his show and at the end of show
*  He's upside down the water tank everything else when he shouldn't have been he should have been in the hospital
*  But instead he did the show that night
*  Collapsed it on the stage was not from the water tank
*  But right after the water tank was rushed to a hospital and died in the hospital, and what was the diagnosis?
*  What did he die from well?
*  1926 right little voodoo
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, wow so when you mean that
*  That's the thing about someone who does something that pushes it to the edge like that
*  I mean when someone sees you hold your breath for 20 minutes. What's fascinating about is not just that it's hard to do
*  But that you might die
*  Yeah, right yeah
*  Yeah, or some people say oh, what what's how's he doing it? What's the trigger? You know so there's all different interpretations
*  But the worry the thing that thrills people yeah is like the you know that well
*  Yeah, the the idea that something could go wrong
*  That's why everybody watched the evil Knievel because he might wipe out on and he often did wipe out. Yeah, yeah
*  What do you this?
*  thrill of getting to that edge is very dangerous right because you keep pushing there's a danger
*  But I feel like if you rehearse and practice and put the best team and don't just do crazy things without like a plan
*  Then I feel like the danger is like sure the dangers there, but I also rode my motorcycle here
*  Which is also stored and I've lost a lot of friends on bikes. Yeah, right so
*  Sure, I get what you're saying and I understand all that you seem to like thrills
*  Well, I mean I'd like adventures
*  It's I mean I look at people that do it every day, and I go that's a
*  Brave and California you're allowed to like weave so that's that's kind of amazing
*  Where do you see this do you have like a
*  Grand vision of your life in terms of like these stunts that you do like would do you have?
*  Like some ultimate threshold that you'd like to get to
*  We have to take a break. I want to make sure that I'm okay, okay?
*  We bleed yeah, yeah, we'll take a break. I'll be right back
*  So we got to clean up your wound. Yeah, it was fine. Yeah, you're you seem to enjoy it
*  You really do you were laughing while they were cleaning it up and checking it and like it's good. We're good
*  There's just what was it the blood what was it that was bothering you?
*  He's drinking all the water prepare for swallowing a frog. I just felt you know too much
*  Of the magic becoming real
*  How much water do you have to drink?
*  Do what you want to do?
*  Do you have to drink it at that certain speaks I've seen people that can chug these they just shove the whole thing down their
*  Face it's almost like a magic trick itself they can drink it. Yeah, those guys are just I had like the guy that was the fastest
*  work on it with me, but
*  How many do you have to drink?
*  You've drank three so far. Yeah plus the two out there, but yeah, so fives you have to drink eight total
*  Do you need a bucket or anything to throw the frog up in do we have a bucket ice bucket?
*  That doesn't seem like enough fluid though
*  Bucket can this is an American flag bucket in the back that big one oh
*  Perfect oh look at that how convenient this poor frog has no idea
*  Well if it is it's amazing you should sell these to people that don't want biological frogs
*  So that's a fucking live frog
*  I mean he's looking at me. He's moving around he's bobbing his head. He's trying to get the fuck out
*  He's making the thing with the throat. We're gonna be trying to get out. That's a real frog kids
*  No doubt
*  When did you start doing this the frog thing is that enough?
*  Look it over flows
*  There's a guy called
*  There was a guy called the human aquarium
*  And it so the thing about most of the acts that I'm doing by the way like night after night usually the people that
*  Did them it was like they're one act so there's one guy called the human aquarium
*  And he was a guy could swallow frogs and bring them up
*  But he would do it you'd see him swallow them and then you'd see him bring them up
*  So it wasn't magical it was like a skill set I would
*  Usually what I do is I'd put them in my stomach keep them in there for like two hours
*  And then bring them up and freak you out right and I'd have a gallon of water in my stomach, so I have an aquarium
*  That baking soda gets rid of the acid no food 36 hours
*  And then
*  Once I drink this we're at a gallon. We're at four liters, so just under a gallon so
*  So did you not eat for 36 hours in preparation for this yes?
*  That's a lot of not eating for this poor frogs worst moment of his life
*  Let's poor little dude Jamie
*  Just in case you don't think he's real he's real. Oh, there's more than one in there. No. That's just him
*  It's just an illusion I
*  Thought there was a little one there
*  It's a decent size frog too by the way you wouldn't want to swallow a frog that large
*  Mark Twain has a quote he says eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse could happen for the rest of your
*  day
*  By the way back to the James Nester book the way I sing deep
*  Or sent me talks about that's really amazing which is in one of my favorite parts in there
*  He talks about how coral communicates
*  Can I read this thing? I sure yeah sure
*  So he talks about it's one of my favorite things
*  He talks about it's so amazing so let's see where deep
*  Okay, so
*  Like a bunch of notes
*  What app are you using to read from iBooks just because you could keep all the books there and you highlight things
*  Yeah, with iBooks. Yeah, of course. I didn't know you can yeah. Yeah, and then you keep all of your books here, right?
*  Oh, no, I do that on my phone, but I didn't know you could highlight I
*  Rarely read on the phone too. I usually you know
*  Yeah, I only use this is the thing I like live by so it's like ruined my life, but also also had
*  Helped it somehow I guess some way
*  Let's see. I'll take me a second
*  Pull it up. I just like the kindle because it looks like paper
*  You know the paper white ones. Yeah, and they're yeah, and they're easier on the eyes. Yes, that's what I'm saying eyes
*  as well
*  Okay, so
*  Can I just read it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it's part of what the aquanauts and Aquarius are trying to find out
*  They're also trying to crack the more mystical marine riddles like the secret behind corals telepathic communication
*  This is so crazy. What do you write to it every year on the same day at the same hour?
*  Usually within the same minute corals of the same species all the time
*  The same species although separated by thousands of miles will suddenly spawn in perfect synchronicity
*  The dates and times vary from year to year for reasons only the coral knows
*  Stranger still while one species of coral spawns during one hour
*  Another species right next to it waits for a different hour or a different day or a different week before spawning in
*  synchronicity with its own species
*  Distance seems to have no effect
*  If you broke off a chunk of coral and placed it in a bucket beneath a sink in london
*  That chunk would in most cases spawn at the same time as other coral of the same species around the world
*  Which is crazy like you could take a piece of coral break it off
*  Put it in london and another coral of the same species will in synchronicity spawn at the exact same time
*  From they have no idea why?
*  The synchronous spawn is essential for coral survival
*  Coral colonies must continuously expand outward to thrive expand outward to thrive to remain healthy and strong
*  They must breed outside of their gene pool with neighboring colonies
*  Once released to the surface the coral sperm and eggs have only about 30 minutes to fuse
*  Any longer any longer and the coral eggs and sperm will either dissipate or die off
*  Researchers have found that if the spawning is just 15 minutes out of sink coral colonies chances of survival are greatly reduced
*  Coral is the largest biological structure on the planet and covers
*  175 000 square miles of the seafloor and it can communicate in a way far more
*  Sophisticated than anyone ever thought and yet coral is one of the most primitive animals on earth coral has no eyes
*  No ears and no brain
*  Is that crazy that's insane. Yeah, that's why I thought it was easy
*  But it's fascinating too that you just have no idea why or how?
*  I mean, what is the what's the mechanism for their communication?
*  The fact that if something's under a sink in london
*  It syncs up with coral the same species on another side of the planet
*  Like what is happening like one of the most futuristic minds of our lifestyles is jim cameron
*  I think like avatar and terminator too and like the machines taking
*  I think he's like is that I think we're gonna look back and be like wow
*  He really predicted a lot. He knew some shit the trees all communicating with each other. Yeah
*  well you've have you read about the mycelium and the
*  The fungus underneath the soil that actually the the trees utilize it through their root structures and they communicate through that
*  Yeah, there's some sort of a
*  There's some sort of a micro riser relationship that fungus has with with these trees and they they actually somehow or another
*  Communicate through each other as well. They're like using the soil like this. That's crazy
*  Yeah, we think of soil as being dirt, right? Just but it's there's life in there
*  Yeah, all sorts of biological life living in that soil
*  Yes
*  and these trees and different plants actually through their root structure communicate and use the use the
*  Fungi that live in the soil and it's very very paul stamets
*  Who's a wizard when it comes to mycology and and talking about fungus and he's got some amazing work that he's done
*  Just his whole life studying mushrooms
*  It's like so advanced when he talks to you about it
*  Like you just really get this feeling like there's something going on that we don't totally understand
*  Like the largest animal they but fungus is kind of an animal it breathes oxygen and it breathes out carbon dioxide
*  So the that's great. I didn't even know that yeah
*  So the relationship is fungus that mushrooms have with the earth is in some ways more similar to us
*  Than it is to plants
*  Because plants are breathing in carbon dioxide obviously and breathing out oxygen. So the fungus are closer to func
*  Yeah, then they're living with these things and there's a
*  Group of fungi I guess in the pacific northwest
*  It's the largest living creature other than I guess like biological organism
*  You'd say was a coral reef, but there's something in the pacific northwest
*  That's fucking enormous and it's just one interconnected mushroom structure
*  Wow, it's very heavy. Yeah, and obviously
*  The right ones can bring you to god the right ones can connect you to alien life
*  And yeah, you know the future and tell you what you're doing wrong with the planet
*  Yeah, yeah, so there's some there's something going on with these things into a different part of your consciousness
*  Well, we're just very egocentric and arrogant in our ideas about what the human race means to the rest of the planet because we
*  Have this ability to manipulate things and send texts and emails and it's just about our proportions basically
*  Just because our fingers right ability to like yeah
*  But we think that's so important because it's so important to us because it's so significant
*  Like the ability to watch a television show or not be able to the ability to fly in a plane or not
*  Those things are so significant that we think of them as being the most significant things in the world
*  But meanwhile, there's some animals like like when you see a flock of birds
*  Fly in synchronicity and some sort of strange dance and you're like how the fuck are they doing that?
*  And no one knows they really don't know there's all this guesswork. They're not really sure exactly what's going on
*  How do they know how to travel thousands of miles every season and go back to the place where they spawned?
*  Like they don't know they don't know like how to salmon salmon figure out a way to get
*  All the way back to where they were born
*  They they make their way all the way through the river to the ocean
*  And then when it's time to rock and roll they get all the way back and they have to get back to that one spot
*  They can't get to just any old river. They won't they won't make it. They won't survive. They won't spawn
*  They won't do it
*  They have to get back to the place where they belong and something in their little salmon brains or in their salmon biological system
*  Let them know and we don't know what it is
*  We don't know what it is
*  But we fuck up and we damn these river structures and then they die and they die off the pacific northwest
*  Is it they had a huge problem with that?
*  And they they didn't understand it when they first put these dams in place these salmon would just
*  Pool up and they try to redistribute them to other places and then they're like, nope. I need to go back to where i'm from
*  It's weird man. Biological life is weird and it's it is amazing and it's funny, right? Yeah, we think we're so
*  Because we can do things that other ones can't do but they can do things we can't do
*  Yeah, we just don't put a high priority on what they can do. Yeah for whatever egocentric reason
*  Yeah, but I was I was like I was swimming in a
*  Tonga in the pacific northwest and uh, I was with humpback whales
*  And I was with my daughter and we looked at the mother and the calf, you know, I mean
*  You know swimming we're watching them
*  and um
*  It was it's it's the most beautiful
*  overwhelming moment
*  I'll show you after uh some footage of but um
*  Then I was alone
*  And I was like holding my breath and kind of free diving next to them and and you know when you're not on school
*  But it's not
*  They're happy to be around you
*  And i'm free diving and swimming with the mother and the baby
*  And i'm looking at the mother and i'm certain
*  certain
*  That she's just looking at me but in the nicest way
*  Like in the most peaceful. It was just it's not like a shark eye. That's like, whoa. This thing is like, yeah
*  so
*  I'm like certain that she's like
*  Being trying to communicate something like that. So i'm still on the same breath. I'm communicating and I I go like this
*  And I I go like this I open my arms up and turn to the mother like this so I go like that
*  And the mother mimics the the humpback mimics me and turns right towards me and goes like this, right?
*  So now we're swimming together and i'm like this like kicking i'd fins on and
*  The the humpback is doing the mother is doing that to me and i'm swimming in synchronicity with with the mother
*  And and the baby's following her and then as soon as i'm like done from here and I go back down
*  She goes back down and it was like I wanted to cry
*  But yeah, it's like you think like sometimes of course
*  But also their brains are so much bigger than our but of course they're so
*  Yeah, I still have all this water in my stomach. So if i'm gonna do this, I might let's do it
*  So you need another one of those
*  What is the reason why you need so much water to do this? Is it so that the
*  Frog has a place to be
*  So the frog is safe, you know, i've never injured a frog or anything
*  I'm sure he feels very comfortable knowing that here he goes
*  Oh, Jesus did he hop right out? Yeah, he's like, I know what the fuck is happening here. Oh, hey buddy
*  Okay
*  Hold on let me just okay. So hold on. Okay. I just usually like to give him a little get him a little bath. Oh, yeah
*  Okay, so this is basically the technique and i've put up to 10 frogs inside look so he come
*  So
*  Need more
*  And now we could hang and talk for you know, so how long does he stay in there
*  Um, what's the lungs you've kept him in there and they live like three hours or so and none of them have ever died. Nope. Wow
*  That's pretty mean how bad you have to pee right now on a one to ten
*  Anytime anybody complains about needing to pee i'm going to show them this video
*  Tenth tenth water and what are they eight ounces 16
*  It's more than a gallon of water, yeah
*  Now
*  It's the magical parts I got my mouth empty
*  And I have to like get him to swim up to the
*  How do you do that
*  I don't know
*  I just like did it and had fluoroscopies and looked where they were and then saw that then I forgot how to sort I did sword swamp
*  to like
*  Do you feel them moving around inside you when there's a lot when there's 10
*  Shame of your face
*  Here he comes no, I got no first I like to get a little bit of
*  You force them out now can't talk
*  Just get some more water
*  When's the first time we did this one
*  Um
*  I
*  I worked on it. I started like
*  Three or four years ago and it's been a you know, the first time you put the frog in your mouth
*  No, I didn't swallow the first time. I just wanted to get comfortable with the frog
*  Yeah, and then I got it again after I tried it the second time and then I built up a resistance to salmonella
*  Oh jeez, let's good if you like sushi mouth empty right
*  Here he comes
*  Uh
*  This is so bizarre here it comes
*  It's because I drank so much so it's like I have to like locate it you have to locate it kind of
*  Uh the sound what would you call this jamie asmr?
*  This is so strange
*  So for people that are just listening I highly recommend you go to the video
*  because you're gonna have to
*  Condense. No, no, no, no, no, we're gonna keep this up exactly the way it is
*  People need to see oh
*  Yeah
*  Take out like a liter of water
*  God it's so strange
*  Oh, I spit on biggie
*  Oh
*  That's called the water spout that's how you see put out the fire. Oh my god
*  Hold on
*  The frog is probably like what the fuck did I do deserve this I bet that frog was just like an asshole person in another life
*  That's a gallon of water do we need another bucket maybe go get that plastic bucket in the back
*  The the the I don't know if that's good enough, but for now we'll just use that for now
*  It is, uh quite preposterous to wash the amount of water that's coming out of you
*  Oh, it's just good
*  Better
*  Oh
*  Where's he out right now
*  Boy
*  You got him in there put him in my hands, okay
*  Okay
*  There he is
*  Little fella
*  You've had a road you've had a road buddy
*  So that's the frog trick. He's alive
*  And perfect. Yeah, he seems fine. Oh, don't lose him. I don't want to lose him
*  Hey, you want to put him back in the jar?
*  Water fresh
*  Okay
*  I think i'm gonna need more than paper towels, jamie
*  Yeah, i'm gonna wash my hands eventually
*  Oh, there is handcuffs here. Oh you have a pair. Yeah, jamie real ones. I don't know
*  Yeah
*  But is that just coincidental no, no, no, there's a guy ed calderon
*  He's a guy used to work with the mexican police at the border
*  May take a few paper towels too. Oh sure and he uh
*  He brought us some handcuffs to teach us how to get out of them, right? Yeah
*  I just noticed that they were there random
*  That seems planned yeah, but that's really they were just here
*  He gave them to me and uh, he gave me like a little tool to show me how to uh,
*  How to open them what's this plastic thing? I have no idea
*  But he gave you tools to show you how to open them like how I don't remember
*  I have to go back and watch the video if I ever get caught
*  Yeah, how to get the fuck out. You show like how to pick them
*  How to shove it through the thing to kind of like uh,
*  Go past the teeth of the lock to make it open up so how to pick them. Yes, exactly
*  Is it not gonna work I don't know what you're trying to do there so let's see like
*  What are you physically trying to do oh I just want to see if I can actually break them
*  Break them. Yeah, like break the metal so like really break them for real
*  How do you usually do that I don't know
*  You don't know. No, it's like really hard to break
*  Was it usually easy to break them? No, it's always very difficult to break handcuffs because you're breaking the handcuffs, right? But you're trying
*  Yeah
*  Because there's some sort of technique to it or something using leverage
*  Okay, that's what i'm hoping but I don't know if you
*  How many days of your life do you think you spent fucking with handcuffs if you just
*  Boil it all down to time
*  50
*  Yeah, but this is probably boring for like anybody that's the thing
*  Yeah
*  So you're just trying to use the way the attachment as a leverage point just that yellow thing, yeah
*  That thing might be weird that yellow thing, but yeah, i'm trying to use like, uh
*  What is the yellow thing I don't know
*  I don't know. This is just how ed brought them to us
*  Yeah, I don't know if I can get these things broken
*  Hmm
*  You want to keep talking? Well, I now i'm like i'm gonna be stuck on this. Yeah, but you'll be so preoccupied. Yeah
*  That frog's like what the fuck just happened. Look at him. He's just sitting there breathing. He's showing
*  Yeah, imagine them being a frog. You're like, well, this is it. I knew it was coming one day
*  That's why i'm so scared of bass
*  By the way, they're yeah, these are the the ones I get are like normally they would be like used for bait
*  First I asked the guy I was like could you give me some here and uh, they became my daughter's pets
*  So i've never i've never
*  Never ever injured or hurt a frog
*  But how'd you know that that was going to be the case when you first swallowed one?
*  The first one you swallowed you probably had to be like no I didn't start the fire started with like bingo balls and things like that
*  I would put them inside so you could come out. I started playing around
*  So it started with like, you know
*  How much water could I put in then?
*  How could I spout the water out to use it to put out the fire then could the kerosene float on top then I went to
*  That's gotta be so bad for you. What is kerosene like inside your body? Do you feel it burning?
*  No, but like the problem is all that's no the problem is all that stuff has a residue. What is this guy doing?
*  Jamie it's oil based. This is the kerosene
*  It's water spout thing haji ali egyptian fire eater in human fountain
*  Do you know this guy? Yeah, that's the guy i'm talking about. Oh there it is
*  Yeah, he's a boy
*  There's a really funny clip of see he's spitting the kerosene and then he puts it out with the water which is underneath
*  Because it floats on top. Yeah, look how much control he has. I saw that act and wanted to like figure that out
*  What year is this?
*  Um like almost 100 did 1925. This is almost 100 years ago
*  I mean that guy haji ali. Yeah, he was called the human fire hydrant. That had to be a rough way to go
*  However, he died because he probably did that every day. Yeah
*  Forget those do these after yeah
*  We don't need to do they're very slippery
*  So let me get back to the question that I had before you ran off because you got you were worried about your arm
*  Do you do you have like you've done so many insane stunts?
*  And so many really of these uh bizarre things
*  That require so much of you
*  Do you do you like have a thing in your mind that you have to keep ramping it up and that do you have?
*  a place that you would ultimately like to
*  Get to with these with these things
*  No, I just constantly like kind of try to figure out like what things have been done in the past
*  Historically, and then I try to figure out how to make them interesting and then I figure out how to make them kind of
*  modern
*  so it's not like a
*  you know, it's like
*  It's a it's a small step by step
*  Process and I think about each thing and then I try to put them all together
*  But do you feel like you have to keep pushing the envelope?
*  um
*  well, I have like a few things that i've been trying to
*  work on to
*  Get to that place. So there is like a
*  It's not a push the envelope. It's just I have a bunch of things
*  I've been trying to how many do you have like on the back burner in the back your head?
*  I have two more crazy ones that i'm trying to can you share them?
*  uh
*  I the the thing I will tell you is that if you put them all together the the letters all equal out like my name
*  so that
*  That's all you can say but yeah, I think that's I don't want to go too into it
*  What do you enjoy most do you enjoy?
*  Like if you talk about something too much and then you talk it away. I understand
*  Yeah, yeah, you take away the magic of like what he's gonna he's gonna do what?
*  Yeah, like when it gets announced. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Do you enjoy doing these big things or do you enjoy the live shows or do you enjoy?
*  Freaking people just random people out with magic like all of it
*  So it's not like one specific thing. I kind of love doing card tricks. I love doing magic
*  I love doing things from history. I love looking like the the human aquarium guy
*  You know the the frogs and goldfish and some of that came from houdini writing in miracle monger is all about his act
*  So it's like you look into the history of things that have been done like haji ali the human fire hydrant
*  And you find these there's a great book that ricky j wrote who was an amazing magician where he discusses and explains everything
*  You learn all these things put them together
*  And then what I do that ricky thought was amazing is and insane is like actually take these ideas
*  That that seem impossible but magical and that's what the amazing part is taking them from a
*  Hypothetical image and then learning how to do them. So that's like what's amazing about the whole process to me
*  And ricky's book called learning pigs and fireproof. There's so many bizarre but amazing acts that exist in there
*  So it's like you look at them. You're like, no that can't be real
*  But it was real if you believe it was real how many of their how many of you are there out there?
*  Like this must be a like I always think of stand-up comedians as being a very small
*  Group of people that kind of understand each other. There's there's a good amount of amazing magicians. How many?
*  a thousand
*  There's a planet
*  No, there's a lot of guys that are on me. Yeah, and there's different categories
*  But the stuff that you're doing is not just magic what i'm saying is like this sort of like the crazy
*  Yeah, you're mixing it all you're transcending magic into you go into this weird realm of what the fuck is he doing?
*  I like to use the body as the prop
*  so I like to figure out how to do things where like your body is magic and I think that comes from like I didn't have like
*  You know a lot of many resources to like oh go get which is lucky because then I was like, okay
*  So what can I do with like what's around? Okay an ice pick or a bunch of water or force you be industrious?
*  Yeah, yeah, not yeah, but like you have to figure it out
*  But you also have do you balance it out with like I mean you obviously develop some problems from not eating at one time
*  And you know you've you've got these stunts where they they have this possibility of physically injuring you
*  Permanently. Yeah. Yeah, so I worry to balance out the risks and the rewards
*  Yeah, there's not that many of those people out there. I hope not. No, that's what i'm saying
*  Like the people I would worry about them
*  But you don't worry about yourself. Well, I think i'm careful, you know
*  Yeah
*  I'm still like so we did one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
*  ten five five liters basically that's like a
*  I think that's
*  In one shot. I think that's a record. I don't think i've actually ever done that many
*  You never drank that much water before I don't think so. I think I usually cap it a gallon
*  Well, it's dangerous, right? You can die from drinking too much water intoxication. Yes
*  Yeah, but I think that's if you like flush it out too much but but
*  When you combine that with other things then it's dangerous. So that's well kids have done like in uh, like for torri
*  Fraternity when they have to do those hazing rituals, right?
*  They've died from drinking too much water and there was a woman in san jose. Yeah, it is possible. Of course
*  It was san jose where she was on the radio and there was a thing like how much water can you drink it?
*  She wanted to win an xbox for a kid and she died
*  Yeah, yeah, I think that's when your electrolyte levels get messed up
*  Is that what it does? Yeah, because yeah
*  So you your water becomes too much water in your system and your body doesn't know what to do with it
*  And yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah
*  And it flushes out and to put the imbalance off on your electrolytes
*  So when you do something like this, do you make sure that you consume a lot of electrolytes beforehand?
*  Because you know because I couldn't eat or do anything if you're gonna do the frog
*  Frog
*  And why is it important my friend told me do not do the frog out here
*  So it sounds gross. I don't want you to have to do that because i'm gonna have to listen to it
*  It definitely does sound gross
*  But you you you feel okay after drinking all that water that quickly. Yeah, but I spattered it out. That's true
*  That's right. Most of it right? There's gotta be a lot. Yeah, which is on purpose. Yeah, Jesus
*  You're a weird man david blaine you really are that's what I was getting at like when i'm saying
*  There's not a lot of people like you out there. I'm glad you're there
*  I really am i'm glad you're out there first of all because I think you're very entertaining but also because i'm I
*  I love when there's a new type of person that I meet
*  You know and you're there's not i've met a lot of people but you're you're in this new like oh and then there's this guy
*  You know, this is like a totally new frequency of human
*  Frequency of human or just freak
*  Take out the quency
*  both
*  but
*  I mean, it's it's a very strange path that you're on
*  I mean ultimately it's like at the end of the day
*  It's it's trying to just figure out how to make things that seem as as close to magic as possible
*  And the process is really difficult and tricky and and laborous to get to
*  But eventually you start to figure out this could look magical
*  That's this or this could you know, but you seem like a very joyful person because of all this you you clearly love what you do
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, look at that. You're sparked up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's why I do it. No, you love it
*  Yeah, that's what's interesting. It's like such a strange thing to love to do
*  Stand
*  Crazy you fight
*  Take it down a long time, but that but i'm saying that's crazy like it is maybe but that's the same
*  It's the same you're pushing your body to do things that most people but you're basically you're living in a place where you have to override
*  Discomfort and you have to override what your body's trying to tell you not to do and you push yourself, you know, it's and then
*  And it's that whole journey of pushing yourself to do things that you physically don't think you can do or
*  To set a goal that that's the best part
*  I think i'm just i'm fascinated by people that are really far down on a path that seems really
*  Do you ever we ever brought up that woman stephanie millinger on the podcast before?
*  I follow her on instagram and i know i've posted some some of her stuff on instagram, but she's like a contortionist and um
*  She has like incredible balance and and core strength and she's this very small woman who does insane things with her body
*  Like she did this one
*  She's on a handstand and she bends her back so that her butt touches her head
*  Like her spine is so flexible that you look at some of the things that she does and they don't
*  Seem to be like watch this look at this
*  Yeah, watch how she does this and look and also she's balancing on these posts, right?
*  So but look what she does with her back. Wow, look at that. That is amazing amazing
*  Yeah, and then she stands with one hand and and she by the way
*  She does this like off the side of cliffs and she's incredible like look at the way her body is contorting
*  Yeah, that's incredible. She's pressing her butt
*  Against the top of her head in the craziest way
*  Like it doesn't seem like a person should be able to do that and the amount of physical strength that it takes
*  To move your body like this and balance while you're doing it. It's just
*  It's the the years and the amount of time. Yeah
*  This is what i'm saying like she's so far down the path
*  See if you can find the one where she bounces on the plates that one in the middle where you see the the plate watch this
*  So she takes a this is like a standard olympic weightlifting plate, right? So she puts it down so it's on its edge
*  And then she stands it on top of a bar
*  Right, so you got this like this bar that was it's like a like a small chin up bar
*  So it's a round thing bouncing on another round thing
*  And then she lifts her whole body all the way up and over and does a handstand on this fucking thing
*  I mean, it's amazing. She's amazing. It's unbelievable. And again always smiling always like joyful
*  Loves loves this but the physical strength that it takes to do something like that and the kind of balance
*  That's what i'm talking about
*  Like someone who's on this crazy path where if you you asked someone could someone do that you'd be like no
*  Your body doesn't do it work like that. It's not how body works
*  But it does you just have to take these little baby steps for years and then you look back and you're in a different place
*  And then also you find a version of it and then you figure out how to make it your own
*  Yes, yeah taking something and then made it like a whole yes new art right poetic
*  Yeah, yeah
*  She's or like cirque du soleil like whenever I time I go to see sir
*  I've seen most of the cirque du soleil shows every time I go i'm like what the how the fuck is that possible?
*  What are they they're aliens like yeah, but they're on a path. They're just really far down on this path of extreme dedication
*  Extreme focus and that's what you're doing. You're just doing it with bizarre physical feats and magic
*  It's very interesting. It's very interesting. I'm really happy that you're around. I really am
*  I enjoy the fact that a person like you exists. Well, thank you
*  And uh, I want to thank you for being here too, man. I really enjoyed the fuck out of it
*  It's very cool. Very cool to talk to you too. I've been wanting to meet you for a long time. Oh my pleasure
*  My honor. Thank you very much. Thank you
*  So one more time this will most likely be taking place august 31st
*  Weather permitting weather, but we will let everybody know we'll put it on instagram
*  We'll put it on twitter and if there's if there's any sort of a change
*  Let me know and we'll let everybody know great. Thank you brother. Appreciate you man. Goodbye everybody
