# Joe Rogan Experience #2205 - Legion of Skanks
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b4bQdJ1Vv8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Boys, good to see you.
*  What's happening?
*  What's up, Joe?
*  Um, you have a little adventure coming over here.
*  We did.
*  Got a little lost.
*  Got a little sweating.
*  This one-
*  Did we ever drop down to the wrong spot?
*  This one might be on me.
*  No, no.
*  About halfway-
*  We dropped this off at the completely right spot in his mind.
*  The amount that I cursed him because we thought it was the wrong spot, I mean-
*  That's on me.
*  That's on me because I should have got you guys the car service.
*  We have the car service.
*  It takes guys all of the- I figured you guys were already here.
*  You had transportation-
*  Well, what was funny was when we were at about, I don't know, three quarters into our three
*  quarter mile walk here, you sent somebody over to come get us and he pulled up in a
*  car and he goes, he goes, you guys for Joe, right?
*  And we said, yeah.
*  And he goes, follow me.
*  And then just drove away in the car.
*  No way.
*  He didn't let us-
*  You know what?
*  You were too sweaty.
*  Yeah, that's what it was.
*  We were just having a shirt on still.
*  You could see him blistering.
*  My eyes were going, my hair product was in my eyes.
*  Hey, are you guys here for Joe Rogan?
*  He told me to bring you this heat lamp.
*  Here, you can carry that with you.
*  The sauna is ready when you get this.
*  Pocket warmers, guys.
*  Can you guys carry these kettlebells over to the studio?
*  I was in Utah where it was like 50 degrees and then I came right here to Austin.
*  It was like 98 when I got out of the car.
*  I was like, yo, I forgot.
*  Summer doesn't end in Texas.
*  It lasts a long time, but it does get winter here.
*  It's hilarious when the Austin people don't know what the fuck to do when it snows out.
*  There's no infrastructure at all.
*  I got stuck in Houston for maybe four or five days because they had, I mean, I want to say
*  a light flurry and there's a little bit of ice, but Texas doesn't have like trucks.
*  No plows.
*  No salt trucks.
*  When we had the big freeze the first year I moved here, they did nothing.
*  They did nothing.
*  They just let it thaw.
*  I was the one flight that was able to get at one time to go to Dallas for a gig and
*  they had like, it was three inches of snow, but the whole place shuts down.
*  Thank God, because the car that picked me up to drive me to the hotel that night, if
*  there was other cars in the road, dude, it would have been ping pong.
*  Every time he stopped the car, it would turn sideways completely.
*  But he was just calm because there was nobody else in the road, so it didn't really matter.
*  Telling the sketchiest feeling is not when you're in Edmonton or some shit and they have
*  to spray that stuff on the wings.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The ice in the wings.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You're like, yo, like there's a real, because it's kind of a misty freezing rain thing
*  going on.
*  You're like, there's a real possibility, like, you know, fucking one in a thousand,
*  one in a hundred thousand chance that those fucking things aren't going to go up because
*  they're frozen stuck.
*  So they have to spray it.
*  And what would happen if those things didn't go up?
*  You're fucked.
*  Is that it?
*  There's no control of the plane.
*  I just don't, I don't want to know anything.
*  I'm like, they got to back up.
*  That's my thing.
*  I always remember talking to, I think it was Ben Bailey years ago and I was like, you know,
*  so funny, the more I fly, the more I'm afraid of flying somehow.
*  I go, but I have to just assume planes are designed that like if all fails, like they're
*  designed to kind of be able to be able to be glided to safety.
*  And he was like, no, if you lose all the engines, you know, if you lose all the engines, it
*  nose dives directly to the ground.
*  Well, that's why it was such a big deal.
*  The miracle on the Hudson.
*  It was a miracle that the guy was able to land the plane when the engines went out.
*  That's because that guy was like a real serious pilot.
*  Yeah.
*  That guy really knew how to fucking fly a plane.
*  He was a real hero.
*  I love the argument that he's not.
*  It always makes me laugh.
*  They're like, he did his job.
*  He goes, sure.
*  Well, he's, but I mean like, he was a survivor on his own.
*  If he was a trans woman, if he was a trans woman from a third world country, he'd be
*  the greatest hero of all time.
*  I remember when it landed, I was rooting for him to be drunk.
*  Like I just wanted him to come out and just like fucking did it.
*  I also wish there was like a drag queen that would do something heroic.
*  So everyone's got to like praise the things of like, you know, like cunt lips, thunder
*  tits.
*  They always got stupid names.
*  How weird is it that it's an argument whether or not drag queens should be reading books
*  to kids?
*  It's what's the upside of that?
*  Yeah.
*  Like why?
*  Whose idea was this?
*  Can we talk to the first person who came up with this idea?
*  You know what kids lacking these days?
*  The most aggressive gays yelling at them.
*  Yeah.
*  Sit and listen to the story, honey.
*  At the very least, I've met some very nice drag queens, but at the very least, it's an
*  odd choice that might be one that someone's out of their fucking mind chooses.
*  It's a possibility, right?
*  It's not zero.
*  Absolutely.
*  Well, I went to one.
*  It's also like, it's almost like a, we actually did a sketch.
*  We did a thing called Legion of Sketch where we performed dirty comedy to kids in the library.
*  And that was the whole point is that we were like, you know, it's an adult job.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's not meant for little kids.
*  So somebody wearing makeup and even though it's not inherently sexual what they're doing
*  in that moment, it's like what their whole thing is meant for a nightclub for adults.
*  Well, the people who defend it, they always go, I don't know, have you ever been to one
*  like it's just a guy in a dress reading a story?
*  It doesn't have to be weird.
*  But then you're like, you know what would be even less weird is a guy not in a dress
*  reading a story.
*  Or just a teacher.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like whoever the person.
*  So I guess the argument for it would be this is what makes these people happy.
*  We should normalize the fact that they want to dress up like very flamboyant women.
*  We should normalize that.
*  The argument, if you want to make people happy, you shouldn't have porn stars reading books
*  to kids either.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you wanted to take the other side's position, like what would you say?
*  You would say, hey, this is fine to do that.
*  It's fine to do that.
*  But it's still a biological man who's dressed up like a woman who's reading things to kids.
*  It's like the odds of this being 100% like really rational, fascinating person that's
*  going to read books to a kid or someone who's out of their fucking mind.
*  It's not like a 0% thing.
*  It's like something you should be kind of concerned about.
*  If it was a stripper reading books to a kid.
*  Or an ex-convict.
*  Yeah.
*  You would just go like, yeah, it's just not like...
*  The whole thing that's interesting about it is you take this fish out of water and I just
*  don't think you should be experimenting with kids.
*  How about guys on parole for violent crimes?
*  How about have them read to kids?
*  They give them puppies now.
*  How about corrupt politicians?
*  Have them read to kids.
*  That I object to the most.
*  How about CEOs have been arrested for embezzlement?
*  How about them reading to kids?
*  How about all kinds of like maybe cool, maybe cool, but maybe super fucking sketchy people
*  reading stories to kids?
*  There's a lot.
*  There's a lot of them.
*  It's reading time with Day Sean.
*  I don't know, dude.
*  I was...
*  Mary.
*  People convicted of violent assault, but they wouldn't do it again.
*  It was a bad move.
*  How about reading to kids?
*  I was on one of those apps to hire a babysitter recently.
*  And it's a very weird that I'd never done it before.
*  And it's almost like a dating app.
*  Like you're swiping left and right, but it's for babysitters, for your kids.
*  And I will say, and I'm on the Legion of Skanks.
*  I'm a comedian.
*  I hang out in a pretty seedy world.
*  It is amazing how judgmental you get when you're just judging a person off their face
*  over whether they're going to watch your kids.
*  Nose ring.
*  You'll never be more racist.
*  Tattoos on the faces are no go.
*  It's not like being an MMA fighter.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like you might be cool.
*  You might be a cool person.
*  Sugar Sean O'Malley can pull it off.
*  Post Malone can pull it off.
*  But not the fucking babysitter.
*  I'm considering getting a tattoo on my face at Skankfest.
*  Like how about if there was...
*  That's a good idea.
*  That's the one we said.
*  Guys with tattoos on their faces that wanted to read stories to kids.
*  Would that be cool?
*  Who would be cool with that?
*  I would be weirded out.
*  If it was Post Malone, you'd be like, of course.
*  He's so cool.
*  Let him read the stories to kids.
*  That'd be really fun.
*  But would you be weirded out if your kids had like a face tattoo teacher at all?
*  Yeah, I'd be weirded out.
*  I would not like that.
*  Listen, like Jelly Roll is the coolest motherfucker alive.
*  He's got face tattoos.
*  There's a lot of people that do them and wish they didn't do them or do them and are happy
*  with them and like them.
*  It's cool.
*  But the possibility of you being out of your fucking mind is in there.
*  No, no, absolutely.
*  But I also just mean the idea that like, even like I said, I don't think a teacher with
*  face tattoos might be the best teacher in the world.
*  I just think it's like as a parent you'd walk in and be like, this motherfucker is cute.
*  It's possible that they could be though.
*  They might be the best teacher in history.
*  They have to be so good in spite of it.
*  They have to go so far above and beyond.
*  If someone with a face tattoo is an excellent teacher, then let them teach inmates.
*  But stay away from my children.
*  I don't have time for this.
*  Isn't it funny we have no problem with sleeves?

*  running, training, you know, but your gut health is just as important.

*  Like if my kids teacher had a sleeve, I'd be like, oh, the teacher's cool.
*  But I think thirty years ago they probably did.
*  If you showed up as a teacher thirty years ago, people were like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
*  OK, biker Bob, now it is a sign of cool.
*  If you see someone with a button down shirt and like this part of the arm you see is completely done, you're like, all right.
*  Yeah, I think there's probably it's probably conservative America would still feel like a little weird about somebody with a sleeve teaching a little girl in kindergarten as a representative of conservative America here.
*  I will say I was at my daughter's T ball game and there was one of the moms pregnant and one of her kids is in the T ball game.
*  And she's in shorts and just has two leg sleeve tattoos.
*  Now, no judgment.
*  It was fine. But there was something where I was like, it's just a little odd.
*  That's our generation.
*  I'm judging the town for letting the girl play T ball.
*  It's crazy.
*  It is. It's dangerous.
*  I'm judging you for coming out as conservative.
*  I now I know, Joe, this is my new grift.
*  I am now Mr. Conservative.
*  We've got to get Trump elected.
*  You've given up on this libertarian stuff.
*  There's no money in it. I figured out.
*  There's definitely no money in it, but that's why they let it exist.
*  You know, if there was another legitimate party that was actually challenging to the Democrats and Republicans, they would attack it.
*  They don't see a peep about the libertarians.
*  Those are in their eyes.
*  The libertarians are just vote stealers from the Republicans.
*  Yeah, they were mad when Trump came this year.
*  But aside from that, they don't really they don't see us as a threat.
*  Yeah, they don't know political party gets mad at the libertarians.
*  They're fucking furious.
*  The Republicans, the Republicans are furious at the Democrats.
*  Nobody gives a fuck what the libertarians say, including me.
*  Dave speaking at the thing was the funniest when he goes, Donald Trump's going to come up here and we're going to show him that we know how to act and behave.
*  And because we are the right party.
*  Fuck you. You fucking putt.
*  Well, I knew I murder a rapist.
*  I got off stage and I passed by Angela McCardell, who's the chair of the libertarian party.
*  And I walked right by her and I went zero percent chance they listen.
*  She just went back and go, now let's go watch the shit show because this is going to be so how much of a shit show was it?
*  I was awful. I mean, just the way we watched like a little bit of it.
*  So I went they kicked me out of backstage because it's like a Secret Service like checkpoint thing or whatever, because they're real on top of that.
*  Not so big on people with rifles on buildings, but they got me out of there.
*  And so I go out and I come back around in the main room and I'm just I walk into the middle of just all the people like that.
*  And one of them at one point, Trump goes, he goes, I fired Comey and one of the libertarians goes, because he was because he was on to you.
*  And I just turned to him and I went, that's not even the right heckle.
*  And then the guy goes, oh, what's the right heckle?
*  I was like, I can't I can't give it to you right now.
*  The call was a wild scene.
*  The Comey thing was what would they they were alleging, first of all, that the Clinton campaign was spying on the Trump campaign, right?
*  Yeah, it was it was after that.
*  He was trying to blackmail him and fucking Trump caught on to that.
*  We fired him. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure.
*  Yeah. How do you know?
*  So OK, so if here we go, guys, so you know, like, well, you know, the current about the GES,
*  they're really human. He goes, he did.
*  He definitely fucked everybody and and did this and raped everyone.
*  And then we're like, well, how do you know?
*  He's like, I read.
*  I mean, you're always reading somebody else's book.
*  So what is but that's what you can do in comedy is that is enough to checkmate most comedians.
*  I read and you know, you're not worried. All right.
*  Yeah. Well, it's also it's just a funny thing to say.
*  You could also be like admitting the ridiculousness of yourself.
*  I'll say I read, you know, because it's kind of an admission like I'm not there.
*  I didn't go to the freak.
*  I was one of these parties and man, he did.
*  He was like, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go fuck Meek Mill in the butt.
*  But like that's never going to happen. No one comes out.
*  So if you're like if you're looking at that, what like what makes you conclude that he definitely was doing that?
*  Because he basically the first time they ever met, he presented him with the steel dossier, which had all of the like dirt, the pee pee stuff.
*  Yeah. All the pee pee shit in it. I shouldn't say shit.
*  There was no shit alleged. Just piss.
*  Russian piss. Yes. Alleged Russian piss.
*  Yes. That's the aspect.
*  Is that what collusion means?
*  Something like that.
*  And then he plays so dirty.
*  They play dirty like a movie.
*  It's it's pretty crazy.
*  Yes. It's really wild.
*  I don't know. I mean, did you see that?
*  That was the number one fear of having these big agencies have so much power that they would never want to relinquish it.
*  They would never want to say like, hey, look, we're patriots.
*  I think we should fall by the rule of the Constitution and let the people decide.
*  It's like everything else, man.
*  Once you start running shit, you don't want to stop.
*  Well, I've seen friends of mine have way less power go to their head.
*  It's weird, right? I wouldn't trust these two with power.
*  But it is a weird thing to watch, right?
*  Yes. It's bizarre.
*  That's human beings, though, man.
*  Now imagine that, but with no showbiz.
*  No showbiz. So you get in that rush.
*  But now the rush is controlling the world.
*  Well, isn't that the way we feel about like crushing on stage, the way Hillary Clinton feels about crushing Libya.
*  The game we saw, he died.
*  I fucking crushed.
*  Wasn't that L. Ron Hubbard, though?
*  L. Ron Hubbard was like, hey, this will be funny. I'll start this and go into this, start a religion.
*  And then like years later, he said when his friends he told that to hit him up like, this is crazy, dude, you did it.
*  He's like, you know, you ran that scam.
*  And he's like, scam? You better get your feet and his levels checked.
*  He just started eating his own shit because like.
*  Well, he was.
*  Do you know that he's the most prolific writer in human history?
*  Sci fi was, yeah.
*  More fiction.
*  Yeah.
*  Than any other human being ever.
*  More than Stephen King?
*  More than anybody.
*  And one Bible.
*  And not a second draft amongst them.
*  Everything he wrote was nonsense.
*  Everything he wrote was hot nonsense.
*  If you read it, it's like these are the dumbest stories.
*  Well, do you remember the Dianetics commercials?
*  Do you remember the commercials with the.
*  Yeah.
*  The volcano, like the lava was going on.
*  Yeah.
*  And he gave you like, like the most generalized things anyone feels.
*  He goes, are you sometimes tired and sometimes awake?
*  It was like, you did it before, right?
*  Lewis, when they had the time square.
*  Because I you just it was just kind of cool.
*  I was like a dumb kid.
*  So like, hey, do you want to test your stress levels?
*  It's like, boy, do I.
*  And I went over and I held these dumb things and like.
*  The ones that go like that.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, you're stressed.
*  And I was like, I am right.
*  They're like, come on inside.
*  They brought me into this weird thing.
*  They tried to sell me a book.
*  I don't really remember.
*  I remember that too.
*  And I did that in San Diego.
*  I was down there filming something.
*  And we were in the park.
*  And it was like at a time where I could, a lot of people didn't know who I am.
*  And I could sneak in and I sat down at this guy's table and he gave me the meter.
*  And I put my hands on the things and he told me what it was reading.
*  I'm like, how does this thing function?
*  Like, what is it?
*  What is it reading off my book?
*  And the dude was like, I don't want to explain.
*  He didn't want to really be there.
*  He's just a member who got roped into doing this thing.
*  He had zero enthusiasm about the.
*  They have the street team job for.
*  It's the lowest level.
*  It's the lowest level job you could have for is having to go out and bark people into your church.
*  Have you guys read Lawrence Wright's book about it?
*  I don't think so.
*  It's called Going Clear.
*  Oh, I saw the documentary, the HBO thing.
*  Yeah.
*  The book is the documentaries basically tells you all you need to hear.
*  But it's so it's such a strange religion.
*  But here's the thing about it, man.
*  This is what's weird about religions.
*  It's this is my you know, I'm a moron, but I occasionally have to go to church.
*  I occasionally have these moments where I'm like, I think I know what the fuck is going on.
*  If you really believe it, it benefits your life, even if it's hot nonsense.
*  Even if it's a 14 year old kid who finds golden tablets that contain the lost work of Jesus and only he can read it because he has a magic rock.
*  But if you get enough of those people, they make great neighbors like it fucking works, man.
*  They just want their kids to go to school.
*  But here's my question.
*  Is it better to be an atheist and to be this person who just like objectively looks at the world and like none of this makes sense?
*  There's no way there could be a God.
*  I think when you die, you die.
*  And that guy's fucking miserable.
*  It's that guy's taking medication and all of his friends think he's annoying.
*  I'm an atheist.
*  And you're right about all that.
*  Do you believe in like in a higher power?
*  No, no, I don't not believe.
*  I believe that's what my girlfriend says.
*  I believe there's more to the universe and more to life than we can think of through our narrow field of perception.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think there's more to human contact and interaction than just people talking to each other.
*  I think there's a thinly veiled reality that we live in where we express our souls to each other.
*  That's what I think.
*  And I think it's a very complicated and confusing thing that's fucked up by lies and deception and violence and war.
*  Well, so many of them are enhanced by friendship and love and communication.
*  And it's weird.
*  There's a thing going on that's beyond just like you're born and you die.
*  And if that thing keeps going, when the physical body stops existing, I wouldn't be surprised.
*  I think religion is always the funniest to dial back to, though, because all the organized stuff you were doing the Joe Smith story finds the tablets or the plate.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Everything that could be more of a religion that was like like a pitched by a dude do a bunch of dudes.
*  Well, this turns out we could have a whole bunch of whole bunch of chicks and they always have to live next to each other.
*  And you fuck.
*  They were like it was like racist up until like 30 years ago.
*  They were like black people were like the seed of the devil or whatever.
*  And then they change it. They're like, no, no, no, no.
*  They're racist when your women are bearded.
*  You ever see sister wives? It's not like you're stoked to have three of them.
*  Yeah, but you're too too four is an eight.
*  We know the guy who wrote it.
*  That's when she gets sketchy.
*  Yeah, there is something about when it's from thousands of years ago.
*  It's easy to go like, look, there was a burning bush.
*  God spoke to this guy.
*  You're like, when? Like five thousand years ago.
*  All right, fine. But when you're just like three Wednesdays ago, it happened.
*  I'm not buying that.
*  There's enough stories that are similar about the ancient stories of like apocalypses,
*  like the stuff about like the Epic of Gilgamesh is real similar to know in the arc.
*  There's enough of those.
*  Jesus was like they keep on just redescribing him from like thousands of years before Jesus was around that story of him being the son of God and all that.
*  The Virgin Mother.
*  He's a black woman now.
*  Jesus is trans.
*  He could have been a black woman.
*  He could have been an alien.
*  Jesus?
*  Yeah.
*  Sure.
*  That's the most Joe Rogan sentence I've ever heard.
*  Jesus could have been an alien.
*  If there was like someone who came here and didn't make any sense that he was born and he just existed but knew everything and was the son of God and was trying to straighten everybody out and then they kill him.
*  And he's like, all right, we tried.
*  It literally could be an alien.
*  I mean, if you're thinking about what how long ago this is, this is thousands of years of people telling a story.
*  Right.
*  I mean, how long after Jesus is dead before they even write the new stuff?
*  Well, why is that?
*  It's like that long ago.
*  People were years after his death.
*  Right. At least 100 years after his death.
*  Well, it's but you know, I'm saying like also years ago, like no one considers the idea of works of fiction.
*  Right.
*  Like everything then was just written from the thing versus entertainment.
*  There's a combination of that and then real events are trying to document.
*  So both things are true because they had a lot of shit going on back then.
*  Like they didn't have to write fiction.
*  They were getting killed by swords.
*  People getting lit on fire and shot with arrows.
*  Like there's not a time to be making shit up.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like what happened to your brother?
*  And it's like, I don't know, a beast got a hold of it.
*  You know, it can't be all coliseum.
*  I mean, once in a while you got blind back.
*  Listen, that's life then though.
*  You're not going to write Harry Potter when you're getting slayed by the Romans.
*  I bet you're fighting a lot of those.
*  I got a good idea.
*  You're probably like, I don't know, a magical school.
*  The dude can walk on water.
*  He walked on fucking water.
*  And then he put a guy's ear back on.
*  Water into wine.
*  Come on. Who's not happy with that idea?
*  A lot of those miracles, I am studying magic right now for my magic show at Skankfest.
*  And I'm reading a book about magic.
*  But a lot of those miracles that they talk about, it's theorized that they were just like magicians that were like doing tricks for people.
*  And they would get like...
*  By the way, Jesus Christ would be a great name for a magician if there was no Jesus Christ.
*  It's got a Chris Angel ring to it.
*  Yeah, Jesus Christ would be amazing.
*  Come see Jesus Christ live at the Rio.
*  Yeah, because it's got like a little bit of a Latin flair.
*  Because you know you could say it like Jesus.
*  Mexicans are the only people that I know of, or I guess Spanish people as well, where the name Jesus, it's literally Jesus.
*  You could name your kid Jesus.
*  Like how many Muslim kids are named Muhammad?
*  A lot!
*  It was like the number one name for boys in Ireland like a couple years ago.
*  Muhammad?
*  Yeah, Muhammad. It freaked people out. They're like, what?
*  But you can't name your son, your American son, Jesus.
*  It's going to raise a few eyebrows if you bring baby Jesus to the daycare.
*  But isn't that crazy?
*  I know you legally can't name your child Jesus Christ.
*  Oh, is that true?
*  That's it, legally you can't. I swear to God.
*  Do you think the pendulum is going to swing back to like, there was a time...
*  Naming kids Jesus?
*  No, but naming kids...
*  There was no actual lines drawn on naming years and years ago as far as race goes.
*  So my grandmother's boyfriend when she died, his name was Jerome.
*  Look at this.
*  There's old Tyrone, like white Tyrones.
*  That just stopped one day and those became black names.
*  These are all names that are ruled illegal by courts within the US.
*  So Bobby Green just got his name changed to King.
*  He got his name legally changed to King Green.
*  Yeah, he's going to have to take this to the Supreme Court.
*  Maybe not, because it said...
*  Go back to that please.
*  But the states, but before that it was like showing how many states.
*  Does it say that?
*  Why can't it be 1069?
*  So it was just the way it was phrased in the earlier thing that you had.
*  Okay, here it is.
*  There's a handful of names that were ruled illegal by courts within the US.
*  So that could be local courts.
*  So in some areas it's illegal to have these names.
*  Not all areas.
*  But imagine you can't even call your kid Santa Claus.
*  How about Majesty?
*  Imagine you can't call your kid Adolf Hitler.
*  I'm going to name my kid Roman Numeral too.
*  You could only call your kid Majesty if you are an R&B singer.
*  Those are the best.
*  There's so many rapper kids.
*  There's so many rapper kids.
*  Kids have a name like Prince.
*  Yeah, that's fine.
*  Prince is fine.
*  Is it just that spelling though?
*  Could I name my kid Messiah with an apostrophe in the middle?
*  Right, I bet you could.
*  Yeah, you'd change the spelling.
*  There you go.
*  Messiah needs an apostrophe.
*  Let me see the list.
*  What is the third?
*  You can't be the third?
*  Just Roman Numeral 3?
*  You can't be the Roman Numeral 3?
*  That can't be your name?
*  Does that come up a lot?
*  Are they out to make it illegal?
*  Imagine all the shit that's legal.
*  Vos was going to name his kid after his third album.
*  They'll let you in the border, but whatever you do don't use that.
*  Number 3 thing.
*  That Roman 3.
*  That's fucked up, dude.
*  You can't call your baby Roman Number 3.
*  But like 2 and 4 are okay?
*  Okay, in 19...
*  A North Dakota man named Michael Herbert Dangler, who was adopted, wanted to change his name
*  to these four numbers, which held philosophical and personal significance for him.
*  State court rejected his name change request in 1976.
*  They're like, beat it, Dangler.
*  Can't be used, can't be named due to potential confusion.
*  But isn't Elon Musk's kid's name like the sounds AOL used to make?
*  Well, he calls his son X, but it's like a bunch of other letters too.
*  Yeah.
*  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
*  Bro, imagine if you had that guy's son, but you were a moron.
*  That would suck.
*  That's fine.
*  I mean, Arnold Schwarzenegger had a son that was a schlub, and then the one he didn't know
*  he had looked just like him and was shredded and working out constantly.
*  Yeah, it's hilarious.
*  I think the other son's Jack too now.
*  He had to catch up then, because he was a schlubby kid.
*  Sometimes he just, you know, fuck dad.
*  I don't even want to lift weights.
*  If you're Arnold Schwarzenegger, you have so much privilege.
*  I would just never want to lift weights at that point.
*  I can never imagine building the foundation as a young Schwarzenegger to be like,
*  I'm just going to work really hard now at something.
*  Right, because you were born inside that house.
*  You're half Kennedy, half Schwarzenegger. That's crazy.
*  Tom Hanks has a son that became another Tom Hanks person,
*  tucking in his polo shirts on a Sunday, and then one went full wigger.
*  There's like a thing about the way you name your kid
*  that someone brought up the other day.
*  Fuck, I wish I remember who was saying this.
*  But there's like an actual principle to it,
*  and I think it's based on Chet Hanks.
*  It's like calling him Chet just sets him up to be a Chet.
*  Oh, it's like, yeah, you've never met awesome Chas.
*  Chas Palminteri is the exception to the rule.
*  That's not what you picture when you picture a Chas.
*  Well, isn't Chas Palmin... is that his full name?
*  Is that what he said, or is it a shortened version?
*  It's probably Charles, my guess would be.
*  There's certain names that are associated.
*  I have an ex-girlfriend. I won't even say her name.
*  This is how crazy she is.
*  Every girl I've ever met with this name is a crazy bitch,
*  but she's so crazy that I refuse to say her name out loud.
*  Wow, it's like Beetlejuice.
*  I saw Beetlejuice last night.
*  How was it?
*  It's fucking great. It's fun as shit, man.
*  It's fun as shit.
*  I heard the reviews are not good.
*  That's probably why you like them.
*  I heard the crow was terrible.
*  I didn't hear about the reviews until after I saw it, though.
*  I didn't know anything about it.
*  I just went in cold. It was great.
*  That was like the female Ghostbusters.
*  Everyone hated it so much that I watched it on a flight.
*  I was like, it wasn't that bad. It was kind of fun.
*  But Beetlejuice is better than that.
*  Beetlejuice is really good.
*  The female Ghostbusters is terrible.
*  It's fucking great, man.
*  It's like on par with the original movie.
*  It's Tim Burton at his best.
*  It's really good, man. I fucking enjoyed the shit out of it.
*  When I heard that people didn't like it, I was like, really?
*  I believe all the bullshit I read right away.
*  They're like, Michael Keaton's only in it for 10 minutes.
*  So they wanted to make sure that he wasn't in it anymore.
*  Because in the first movie, he was only in it for 13 minutes, a total.
*  So they didn't want to change that element.
*  So they purposely made it so he was in it for around the same amount of time.
*  All that fucking numbers talk is nonsense.
*  The movie's fun.
*  You don't give a shit if he's in there.
*  When no one's a writer, it's great. Everybody's great.
*  It's a fucking fun movie, man.
*  It's Tim Burton at his weird best.
*  It's very weird.
*  No one trusted Alec Baldwin on set anymore.
*  I met one on a ride on the streets in New York City when I was selling comedy club tickets
*  right after she got arrested for shoplifting.
*  That was the most bizarre thing ever.
*  Because you could have got her.
*  Maybe.
*  You're like, oh my god, she has the same likes as me.
*  I can afford to buy you makeup, you crazy bitch.
*  But it's just genuinely craziness, right?
*  Because she's rich. She was a movie star at that time.
*  She didn't need the money.
*  I think it was a thrill thing.
*  I think for a lot of people it's a thrill thing.
*  What's the last thing you stole, Joe?
*  I stole a candy bar when I was 13.
*  That's the last thing?
*  Yeah. I got caught.
*  It felt so embarrassing.
*  Security guard pulled me into a back room.
*  I was terrified.
*  I didn't even know what I was doing.
*  I was just doing it because I thought I could get away with it.
*  We were fucking young kids walking around.
*  What's the worst thing you got caught stealing?
*  Mine was stuffing porn magazines down the front of my pants.
*  And putting my shirt over it.
*  And I mean, the guy at the drug store was baiting me to do it.
*  He couldn't wait.
*  He was baiting you?
*  Like he was leaving porn out?
*  No, no, no.
*  The porn section was in this magazine.
*  He tricked him.
*  He tricked you.
*  He tricked me.
*  He tricked me.
*  He tricked me.
*  He tricked him.
*  He tricked him.
*  A porno mag and then he's got a fishing rod.
*  He's like, I'm going to catch this little kid.
*  It was entrapment.
*  Baiting is the wrong word for him.
*  He knew I was getting ready.
*  He felt that I was waiting to find my moment.
*  He could have stopped you before you did the climb.
*  He could have stopped me before I did it.
*  He said, hey, you can't be in here unless you're going to blah, blah, blah.
*  I kind of made notice.
*  He laid back and I was kind of like, he knows?
*  I'm like, I guess not. He's just sitting there.
*  He's just using your shirt to show the half of porn magazine is sticking up.
*  How old were you?
*  I ran like 12 maybe.
*  I ran so fast.
*  12 year old boys should not be left alone.
*  For their own devices.
*  I used to run cars when I was 12 years old.
*  Me and my friends would break into cars in the shop right parking lot.
*  And just clear out all the change in the center console.
*  All it takes is one bad kid in the neighborhood that's fun.
*  My biggest deal wasn't even for money or anything.
*  I was staying at my grandmother's friend's house.
*  My aunt and aunt needed an uncle Herb.
*  And uncle Herb had a nice stack of porn magazines that I found.
*  There's a pattern.
*  No, this is funny.
*  Well, this is one I thought I'd get away with for no reason.
*  I think every one of these stories is going to end with Jay being spun around and his shirt lifted up.
*  Like Uncle Herb gets in there.
*  This is proverbially that because I took a few of his friends and friends to the club.
*  And he's got this giant stack.
*  Being like, he'll never miss these.
*  And if he does, he's not going to think it was me.
*  And if he does think it's me.
*  We're going to have this quiet code of like.
*  What are you going to tell my mom I took your porn.
*  Somebody went to find out that you are porn magazines now.
*  That's exactly what he did.
*  He didn't give a shit.
*  He was like, I want my porn magazines back.
*  And then went down the channels from my grandmom to my mom.
*  And I was like, oh, did I grab these?
*  Oh shit.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Oh, dude, that's such an embarrassing thing to get a phone call.
*  Your uncle Herb once is.
*  Pre-internet porn was like gold.
*  When you're a kid at that age, were you.
*  Because we had a magazine that we found in the woods and another kid stole it from us.
*  And it was a thing.
*  Every kid found dirty magazines in the woods.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  You just hope that it was wet for the right reasons.
*  They're always damp.
*  Yeah.
*  Then I had that one at home for a little while.
*  And I used to live in a shitty apartment.
*  I had a drop ceiling.
*  So I said, keep it inside of my ceiling to hide it from my mom.
*  And I was just.
*  It was literally covered in mud and water.
*  Did you guys see that shit that was going down in Philadelphia yesterday?
*  Where one of those street takeovers.
*  I saw a video.
*  A cop car drives towards it and hits his lights and thinks he's going to get them to scatter.
*  And they just jump all over the car.
*  I didn't see that video.
*  I saw a couple of them.
*  It's crazy.
*  And what is it they're doing?
*  Check this out.
*  They've got a street takeover.
*  So they just decided to stand in the middle of the street and block traffic.
*  Oh, is it a protest?
*  No, I don't know what they're doing.
*  I think they're just getting crazy.
*  I don't know if they're protesting anything.
*  I think it's just a group of kids just decided to get crazy.
*  This is the United States of America.
*  If you saw that this was happening in Ecuador, you'd be like,
*  Yo, Ecuador's out of control.
*  But no, this is the United States of America.
*  In Philadelphia.
*  Watch it happen to this cop car.
*  Wait, go back a little bit.
*  Is this news spun out with a person hanging off the car?
*  They're going crazy.
*  It's a street takeover.
*  They're doing that with their cars.
*  That's what they're doing.
*  So they block traffic and then they spin around in circles in their cars.
*  And they organize it.
*  So this cop tries to break it up and they just fuck this cop's car up, dude.
*  Hundreds of kids.
*  Fuck.
*  And no one's in control of them.
*  Go birds.
*  I mean, if you are in that situation and you're parked in your car in traffic.
*  If I'm a cop?
*  What if you're not a cop?
*  What if you're just trying to blast everybody for the wind shot?
*  You can't shoot enough people.
*  There's hundreds of people.
*  They'll get you and they'll kill you.
*  I can get 16 of them.
*  You might be able to get three of them.
*  The first time I've seen someone with authority.
*  John Wick, dude, just headshots.
*  Bro, it'd be such a wild panic knowing you only have 12 bullets.
*  But this one was a nice one.
*  Well, the last one's for yourself.
*  You can't let them have you.
*  The first time you see someone with authority in your life or something,
*  you have to realize a can't win situation is awkward.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  Seeing a cop have to surrender or have to give up.
*  My step-pop, when we were younger, we were driving back.
*  My step-pop was a powerlifter always.
*  A big, tough guy to me, I always thought.
*  And we were driving back from the Philadelphia Zoo one day through Fairmount Park.
*  And they had shut it down for what's called the Greek Picnic.
*  Which is all the black fraternities party in this big, giant park.
*  I love the old Greek guy that shows up for it.
*  It's a Greek barbecue.
*  Jamie, put that video back up.
*  But they, my step, seeing my step, these guys were coming,
*  and they were just walking all through the street, all these black frat dudes.
*  And it was a traffic jam because they were in the middle of the street.
*  And sitting on the hood of our car and stuff like that.
*  And my step-pop just being like,
*  I just see him just kind of sitting there eating it.
*  And realizing, I was like,
*  John, you know what I'm saying?
*  I'm like, I'm going to go to the park and I'm going to eat a chicken.
*  And I'm like, I'm going to go to the park and I'm going to eat a chicken.
*  And I'm like, I'm going to go to the park and I'm going to eat a chicken.
*  And I was realizing, I was like,
*  Joe, why aren't you going to, you know what?
*  You're right.
*  That's one of my biggest fears, that I'm going to be with my son
*  and I'm going to get chumped out by tougher men than me.
*  It's the most horrifying thing in the world, dude.
*  Look at this video.
*  Imagine if you're a person that just was going to see your aunt
*  got in your car.
*  Got stuck behind this.
*  You had no idea you were going to be trapped
*  in this kind of traffic.
*  And they're just going to block off the street for who knows how long.
*  I just have to join them. Just start doing fucking donuts.
*  Also, I mean, Jesus Christ.
*  That's my car on fire.
*  The likelihood of one of these kids getting run over is very high.
*  It happens all the time.
*  All the time.
*  They get hit by cars all the time.
*  They go flying through the air.
*  It's like a dumb thing that they do.
*  Are these stolen cars?
*  Yeah, they're stolen cars. But these guys get so close to each other
*  that they hit each other all the time.
*  All the time. People go flying through the air.
*  Boom!
*  If you're a teenager, it does look like it's a lot of fun.
*  Oh, look, man, if you don't have a dad
*  and your mom's a cunt
*  and she does meth, yeah, I'd be there too.
*  It's a nice cut loose.
*  Imagine being in the middle right there.
*  You'd feel like a king.
*  If your dad beats you, if your dad's an alcoholic
*  who just beats the shit out of you
*  and the only love you get is from your friends on the streets,
*  I'd be doing that too.
*  I was telling these guys yesterday, I saw a video
*  where it's a guy, people filming,
*  anything now, it's a guy in Times Square
*  who films himself going up
*  and just talk robbing a guy.
*  Like, on camera, just talk.
*  He just goes, hey man, come here, come here.
*  He goes, you're doing a new documentary called I Just Got Robbed.
*  He's like, what? He goes, I'm gonna need your wallet.
*  Don't run. Don't be weird.
*  He's just like, intimidate, and the guy, and the guy's name is Rob.
*  He's clever.
*  The kid's so happy that he's not getting beat up
*  and just nervous and the bad guy's not getting beat up.
*  Like, he pleasantly like, gives him everything
*  and it's kind of like, now go over there.
*  He's like, all right, man, be easy, man. Be easy.
*  And the guy's like, all right, man, cool.
*  He just gives him his stuff back.
*  No, no, no, he robs it.
*  He just does it on YouTube.
*  Yeah, it's pretty nuts.
*  Is it even illegal though?
*  Are you sure it's real?
*  Are you sure that he doesn't give it back to him
*  after they stop filming
*  so that it's not a crime and it's just a stunt?
*  No, I think this happens all the time.
*  People get arrested actually for it.
*  Really? How crazy are you?
*  There's people who film someone holding their guns
*  and saying, I'm about to go kill so-and-so.
*  This happens all the time in New York.
*  This happened to a former Miss New York.
*  She was in the park and these two young,
*  like maybe Puerto Rican kids or black kids,
*  they come up, like, hey, we're trying to sell candy
*  for our basketball team, that old scam.
*  And then she was like, I don't have any cash.
*  They were like, oh, you could send us a Zelle.
*  And she was like, sure.
*  And then they got her to give them their phone
*  and then they just sent themselves $2,000 under Zelle
*  and handed her phone back and just ran away.
*  And they just couldn't get their money back.
*  Oh my God. Jesus.
*  I stopped paying attention when you said
*  they may have been black or Puerto Rican.
*  And you said selling candy for their football team
*  or whatever. It definitely was black or Puerto Rican.
*  No, no, no, I know. I was just up there black or Puerto Rican.
*  Never had a white kid try to run the old buy some M&Ms
*  from me scam.
*  You gotta have laws, kids.
*  It's dangerous out there. You leave people to their own devices
*  and you get that shit.
*  You get people going wild in the streets.
*  It's very scary.
*  Thank God we all survived being that age
*  because you're just so stupid
*  and yet you're in the body of kind of a grown up
*  and you just have all this
*  testosterone and fucking being young
*  and not knowing.
*  I could so easily if I lived in Philly have been at one of those things.
*  I was a handful of decisions away from being at one of those things
*  when I was a kid.
*  But does that guy, is the guy, the idiot who keeps jumping over the car
*  and lighting the fire in the middle,
*  does he look back like, is he 55 one day?
*  Going like, oh yeah, I was a little rapscallion.
*  Do you think he lives to be 55?
*  No, probably not.
*  He probably dies under a doughnut
*  or a fucking souped up SUV.
*  There's a high likelihood that young man's involved
*  in other questionable activities.
*  No, maybe, but I'm saying, but there's just those guys
*  like, I don't know how you
*  like, grow up
*  out of that that's going to be something that really
*  nails it.
*  I mean, my childhood wasn't crazy far from that.
*  I mean, I just wasn't with that crew
*  but I was doing pretty like ranted shit.
*  I was stealing and...
*  You guys just couldn't afford to pull that off.
*  You would've.
*  It wasn't a thing back then.
*  Like, that's only been a thing for the last
*  like, how many years, Jamie?
*  The street takeovers?
*  To make internet videos, yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  When I was a kid, there was none of that.
*  No one ever blocked the street and did doughnuts.
*  You did doughnuts in the school
*  parking lot if you knew where the cops were.
*  They would drag race though in Philly.
*  They would like, stop, block off streets and like
*  drag race.
*  That's true.
*  Did you find Jamie the guy robbing?
*  No, I was actually...
*  I checked a couple places.
*  1980s, look at that.
*  Side shows, they call them side shows?
*  That's how I saw it first.
*  It's a thing from the Bay area.
*  So, it first occurred from the streets of Oakland
*  during the mid 1980s.
*  Back in the olden days.
*  It does seem like a very Asian-y activity.
*  Yeah, I think them stealing the cars
*  is probably more of a newer thing.
*  Right.
*  It's a car show essentially.
*  Right, they were showing off their cars.
*  In the 70s and 80s, they'd have the ones with the hydraulics
*  and shit.
*  That would happen.
*  It comes from a Bay area rapper, Richie Rich's side show.
*  Damn Bancroft,
*  to the light, let me warm it up.
*  I hit a doughnut tight.
*  Rap sucks.
*  I hit a doughnut tight.
*  Chevy on my side, window straight tinted.
*  He got hype when he saw me spinning.
*  I'm...
*  Who likes this?
*  I do, I like a lot of it.
*  It's fun.
*  Sun rap is fun.
*  I love tons of rap.
*  Whatever that was is terrible.
*  Also, you didn't really sell it.
*  If I was at an audition, I'd be like,
*  Big Jay, next time, I want you to be in the moment.
*  You're rapping about these things.
*  You really feel this.
*  You feel very strongly about these issues.
*  We have to rap battle this Friday at Skagfest.
*  Oh yeah, I hate it.
*  Oh.
*  I see what you're doing.
*  Although I have a feeling it's going to be better than what I did,
*  but if we find the song sideways,
*  I bet that guy doesn't kill it.
*  That has to come from the air.
*  It's the 90s, I guess, so it might not be mumble rap.
*  Right.
*  Some of the fucking 90s stuff still
*  holds up, man.
*  Most of it does.
*  You know what I listened to the other day? Tim Dog.
*  Tim Dog, you remember that guy?
*  He was the first guy
*  who went against the guys from Compton.
*  Was he based out of LA?
*  No, he's a New York guy.
*  He had a song called Fuck Compton.
*  That was pretty ballsy at the time.
*  Well, that was the worst rap beef ending ever.
*  What is this, Jayman?
*  NWA split up from Ice Cube,
*  and then Dr. Dre left,
*  and Himmity Z went into their own thing,
*  and then that beef ended in AIDS death.
*  You don't see those ones happen anymore.
*  Well, those beefs, they would
*  go to actual shooting each other.
*  That's what's the craziest thing.
*  Never in the history of show business
*  was there a scenario where stars
*  were having other stars murdered,
*  like openly.
*  Well, it's happening now more than ever.
*  It's easier to become
*  a quote-unquote star on the internet now.
*  So a lot of these guys
*  are getting really popular and then getting killed,
*  like young rappers.
*  You know the wildest conspiracy theory about that
*  has to do with intelligence agencies
*  creating rap music.
*  Oh, the CIA made them gangsters
*  and shit like that?
*  That they funded it and promoted it
*  because they wanted to fill prisons.
*  That's the wildest.
*  You want a destabilized society,
*  and you get kids,
*  like young kids,
*  who we're talking about, dumb, stupid,
*  real easily influenced, don't know what the fuck's going on,
*  and you introduce them to rap music.
*  It will most certainly change
*  the way they think about life.
*  Yeah, especially, I don't know enough
*  about that whole conspiracy and stuff,
*  but it is crazy if you're like,
*  if you remember the 80s and 90s,
*  the transformation from hip-hop,
*  from being like the KRS-1,
*  kind of like,
*  there were like all these songs about like cleaning up
*  their streets and listening to your dad,
*  and like, rap was just,
*  it took this drastic turn
*  from being like very positive,
*  like pro-black kind of thing,
*  to just all of a sudden being like,
*  we're killing everybody, and fuck bitches.
*  It's so funny because I listen to a lot of hip-hop
*  like when I work out,
*  but it's like, I'll be listening to the most hardcore shit,
*  and it's like, this is nice, let me turn up the treadmill
*  a little bit, but like if you're in the hood,
*  it's just inspiring you to murder people and rob banks.
*  My favorite workout rap is Nas,
*  because the lyrics are so good,
*  it gets you hyped up.
*  You know, like, that's the thing about
*  the 90s hip-hop,
*  it was like so lyrically based.
*  You gotta listen to any beef raps,
*  any beef raps are the best to work out to,
*  just like, and I take no sides,
*  I'll listen to Biggie and Tupac.
*  Fuck you Tupac!
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
*  Remember when Ice Cube
*  put out No Vaseline?
*  Bro, you do not want to get in one of those rap battles
*  with Ice Cube.
*  He was so great.
*  For his time in rap, he was fucking incredible.
*  Bro, he's such a good writer.
*  Well, they did the song Jackin' for Beats,
*  and that's when he made the song,
*  it's everybody else's,
*  it keeps changing to all the most popular beats,
*  and he just does rap, oh it's great.
*  Didn't he do a lot of the writing for NWA?
*  I think all of it.
*  I think that was basically like the thing,
*  was he wrote all the songs.
*  That DOC guy probably wrote a bit too.
*  You know, I'm friends with Willie D from
*  Ghetto Boys,
*  and he wrote everything.
*  He wrote like most of their songs,
*  and he wrote Fuck a War in 45 minutes.
*  We were talking about it on the podcast,
*  and he sent me a text,
*  he goes, I wrote Fuck a War in 45 minutes,
*  I sat down, and I was like,
*  Motherfucker War! Have you ever heard that song?
*  Where Bushwick Bill's getting recruited?
*  Oh bro, we gotta play it.
*  Can I tell you that
*  one of my favorite lyrics that never
*  stood out to me when I was younger,
*  but always makes me laugh,
*  and my mind's playing tricks on me,
*  is when Bushwick Bill, you know, he's a midget,
*  and then he sings this song,
*  he goes, this wasn't no ordinary dude.
*  He stood about six or seven feet.
*  He goes, that's the end where I be singing in my sleep.
*  He goes, that's not even that crazy.
*  Look at what Jamie just pulled up,
*  Jamie, the investigative journalist that he is,
*  just pulled up that Ice Cube
*  formed his first rap group called CIA
*  in 1986.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's all right in front of us, man.
*  I'm so excited.
*  I'm so excited.
*  It's all right in front of us, man.
*  Gotta connect the dots, bro.
*  Everyone's saying that about Puffy now,
*  like every interview with Puffy, he's just like,
*  just being a little bit weird, but everyone's like,
*  it was right in front of you, bro.
*  He was letting us know the whole time.
*  When Bill Maher said the N-word on his show,
*  and then the next week had to give his apology to Ice Cube
*  was the funniest thing.
*  What a weird person to have to do it.
*  And then he goes, I'm really sorry Ice Cube,
*  and Ice Cube's like, well Bill Maher,
*  this is a good moment to teach you something.
*  Dude, let me hear Fuck a War.
*  This is one of my all time favorite war songs.
*  Bushwick Bill was fun,
*  because he was like a South Park character.
*  Like he can say the wildest shit.
*  Because he just, he looks different,
*  and you're like, ah, let him say it.
*  He's a tiny guy.
*  Did you ever hear Everclear when he tells the whole story
*  of making his girlfriend shoot him in the eye?
*  Yes, yes, crazy.
*  When I used to deliver newspapers,
*  I used to listen to this.
*  On cassette, son.
*  You delivered him on a bicycle?
*  No, I was in a van.
*  I delivered him to my uncle,
*  and I had a, I would go with him
*  like two o'clock in the morning.
*  Throw him out the window?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Dave Smith, you should go on stage to this.
*  I am loving it.
*  Oh, it's great. Give me a little more.
*  That picture's crazy.
*  The cover of that album.
*  It's so funny.
*  This was like hard in the 80s.
*  Yeah.
*  I hate you, damn ho.
*  I don't think the flow of it doesn't seem anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  It seems bubbly.
*  Call me a funky sucker.
*  Can you imagine being a woman
*  being abused by a black midget
*  and he makes you shoot him in the eye?
*  Where's her side of that story?
*  That can't be her first mistake.
*  She's made a lot of mistakes.
*  That's the end of a long series of bad things.
*  You don't just get there because you won the lottery.
*  He takes his eye out.
*  You gotta do the work.
*  You wanna get into a position where you're fucking
*  being forced to shoot your tiny man's eyeball out.
*  Hey, shoot me in the eye.
*  What, you crazy tiny asshole?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Willie's got some great Bushwick stories.
*  That was the guy that I wanted to get on the podcast
*  but he got sick.
*  Like right when we were talking to his people
*  he apparently got sick.
*  Bushwick Bill?
*  Yeah, and he went up in the hospital and I'm like, god damn, that would have been a good one.
*  How old was he when he died?
*  It was a few years back.
*  He wasn't that old.
*  He had a lot of health problems.
*  What year was it?
*  2019, he was 52.
*  Yeah, so it was right before that.
*  He got sick.
*  52.
*  Did you ever get Scarface?
*  No, I'd love to have him on.
*  You ever see the tiny desk thing he did?
*  Fucking incredible.
*  You know that tiny desk performance thing they do?
*  But Scarface did it and like
*  slowed everything down to fit with the vibe
*  of being in this like really tight thing.
*  And so it was like,
*  you know, he's always been a great...
*  Give me some of this.
*  So, Mike Dean with him?
*  White guy stone.
*  Okay.
*  Mike Dean stone.
*  How does it feel, Jay?
*  How does it feel to be on the other end of it?
*  I don't like it one bit.
*  He's got big as those camera lenses, y'all.
*  And it will sound like this, hold up.
*  I said,
*  he greets his father with his hands out.
*  When you're feeling the taste of him,
*  glad to be the man's child.
*  The world is different since he's seen it last.
*  The world is different since he's seen it last.
*  It's kind of strange.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Well, also what's strange is again, seeing...
*  We'll never know what...
*  how corny or not an old Biggie or Tupac would have been.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's funny seeing like, there's nothing he's corny,
*  but he's just an older guy.
*  You know what I mean? This guy doesn't live any kind of gangster life.
*  You think this is corny?
*  No, no, no. I'm saying that he...
*  You get to see how people would become...
*  No, it's not corny at all, but it's much more...
*  softer energy than you ever thought of Scarface in the 80s and 90s.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It does feel like it's a Scarface song
*  that you could read one of these books to.
*  Like this could just be backgrounds.
*  If you told me this was a guy who was in the roots or something,
*  you'd be like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That makes sense.
*  But doesn't it make more sense that he's like this now?
*  This is an intelligent guy that kept evolving as a human being.
*  Sure, 100%.
*  And you should evolve.
*  Yeah, which is great. It's way better than like...
*  Yeah, Jay, you're the only person that hasn't evolved since high school.
*  You're Justin Bieber and you get to sing in a girl's voice when you're 80.
*  You know, that...
*  that high-pitched thing.
*  The first time I heard him sing, I was like, wow, this girl sounds amazing.
*  And they go, that's Justin Bieber.
*  And I go, oh, what a crazy voice.
*  Well, bring him in here anyway.
*  But he was real young back then.
*  What am I looking at?
*  DJ Paul was 3-6 Mafia, right?
*  Yeah, 3-6 Mafia, Slam of the Nob.
*  I just saw DJ Paul at Gathering of the Juggalos.
*  I performed at.
*  He was one of the people performing.
*  It's so funny seeing the people who get what's happening there
*  versus the performers who don't because
*  they're so young.
*  And they're like, oh, they're so young.
*  And they're like, oh, they're so young.
*  And they're like, oh, they're so young.
*  And they're like, oh, they're so young.
*  And they're like, oh, they're so young.
*  And I think it's just the performers who don't because
*  he was up there.
*  He knows, he's been with that audience.
*  I think Tech 9 also does that.
*  So he does all the family chants and stuff.
*  DJ Paul.
*  And he just gets that crowd, gets them going.
*  But they throw shit constantly.
*  They're doing all kinds of crazy shit.
*  Rock Him went up there.
*  And by Rock Him, by the third song,
*  they were throwing shit.
*  But they're into it, the audience.
*  And then he just kind of stops the song and he goes,
*  I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
*  And he's like, oh, they're just doing rock shit,
*  throwing stuff, man.
*  So you can throw shit and we can leave or we could do some rap music.
*  And the crowd was just kind of like, oh, okay.
*  Oh, they got it.
*  See, back in the day, when we did it 15 years ago,
*  dude, they were fucking savages.
*  So I think they're gathering in the juggler's crowd has gotten older.
*  They're all 40 now.
*  So it's like, they're like, okay, if you don't want us to throw stuff,
*  we won't.
*  Which is great.
*  I think they were a little more like, oh, this is our thing, though.
*  I think it's a little bit of a race between throwing stuff or rap music.
*  We did it 15 years ago when we were just so young in comedy.
*  And we didn't know what it was.
*  It was midnight in a tent in the woods with the insane clown posse.
*  It was a comedy tent.
*  It's still that.
*  No, I know.
*  But now that I know who we are.
*  I mean, they had a clown pick us up in a van.
*  DeRosa talks about it in his, he has that joke on a special.
*  Uptux.
*  His name's Joel, he's a comic from Michigan.
*  He still runs it, he just doesn't do it anymore.
*  So they pick you up in a van.
*  We're like in the woods in the darkness.
*  And when they put us up there, like these people aren't there for comedy.
*  They're there for this whatever experience.
*  So they just start throwing like just cans of soda and beer and alcohol.
*  Jay goes to me, he's like, dude, just because I was going first.
*  He was like, I'm like a year in comedy.
*  He's like, Jay's like, just go up there and do jokes.
*  Don't just go up in there and smoke weed and do crowd work.
*  It was like me.
*  And it was Vecchione, who's like a straight up joke guy.
*  So he was like, you're going to set us up to fail if you don't do jokes.
*  So within 10 seconds, like a beer can whizzed past my head.
*  I was like, oh, is that a joke?
*  I was like, oh, I'm going to do it.
*  And then I was like, is that weed?
*  And I smoked weed with them for five minutes.
*  No, Louis had on, he put on the gas mask weed thing.
*  You couldn't even talk through that weed.
*  That was my closer.
*  And then I said, and then Mike Vecchione went out.
*  And I was the only one that was booked on it.
*  I was just like, they want me to do a show.
*  So they were with me on another gig.
*  I'm like, come and we'll do this one.
*  And you guys go on.
*  So Mike Vecchione goes on and it's, they're not paying attention to him and yelling at him.
*  And I remember he kind of looked at me off the stage.
*  And I was like, you can wrap it up.
*  I'll go eat the rest of this shit.
*  I remember one of his premises though.
*  No, I remember the premise because he goes,
*  I said, you know that feeling when it's going rough and you see the light?
*  Somehow you even have another five minute burst in you because you know you are done.
*  So let me see what I can do now.
*  It's almost like that freeing thing.
*  So I gave Vecchione that kind of like, you can wrap it up, dude.
*  And he goes, ah.
*  And I almost saw his energy change and he just goes,
*  he's going to do his last big joke or whatever.
*  And he goes, ah.
*  So hey guys, I had a dream last night.
*  And the crowd, someone in the crowd goes,
*  fuck your dreams.
*  And I don't think he finished a bit.
*  And then he brought me up.
*  And then I was supposed to do like 45,
*  which I did 20 maybe because I remember saying,
*  where they got mad at me,
*  I asked them why there's, to wrap the festival with no black people.
*  And then a black guy stood up and he was like, how about me?
*  And I went, one jug of bro.
*  And then they just booed.
*  And then someone yelled, they all bleed clown.
*  And I just was like, can I go?
*  Oh God, they all bleed clown.
*  Yeah, I didn't know how to respond to that.
*  Isn't it amazing though that you could just,
*  if you just create a place where anybody can join,
*  you're going to get a group of people.
*  You know, whether it's the insane clown policy or the Mormons.
*  Like if you just like throw an open net.
*  I respect the juggalos more than the Mormons.
*  I think they're similar.
*  Well honestly, they're more happy being juggernaut.
*  They're more happy being juggalos than they are if juggalos didn't exist.
*  That should be the judge of all of it though.
*  Like you said before, it's like, what does this actually do for you?
*  Forget whether any of it's real.
*  It's just like, are you happier?
*  Is your life better because you're a juggalo?
*  If you've ever listened to the insane clown posse's music,
*  it is unironically pretty awesome.
*  I thought I was going to hate it,
*  but every song it rules, it's just about clowns killing people.
*  It's just a great beat.
*  It's horror rap.
*  Horror rap.
*  Horror rap is amazing.
*  I am thoroughly, I said that,
*  festival's pretty amazing,
*  I'm thoroughly so just always impressed.
*  The music is subjective to anybody,
*  but I'm like, what they've done I think is amazing.
*  They're incredible.
*  I mean they are world famous known.
*  They just did the VMAs.
*  And they're kind of the only band that's ever pulled off having like a whole festival.
*  Yeah.
*  We are the second one.
*  It's never enough.
*  Without us doing the Gathering of Juggalo's,
*  we wouldn't have even done Skankfest.
*  There's so much influence from the Gathering of the Juggalo's.
*  And our audience, there's a lot of crossover.
*  In fact, I'll say it now because it's too late for people to even go,
*  but our secret guest is the insane clown posse on Thursday night at the kickoff party.
*  It's going to be sick.
*  Dude, Legion of Skanks is one of the most important things in comedy.
*  You guys really are.
*  Thank you.
*  I put you guys in the same,
*  there's these brackets of like Kill Tony, Legion of Skanks.
*  There's a thing about having these battlegrounds where you go,
*  no, no, no, no, we're going to say what we would say if we were fucking around together.
*  Like you can deal with it or you can not deal with it.
*  But this is how we would, the conversations we're having are exactly like Green Room conversations.
*  Well, yeah.
*  And I feel like now, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong,
*  but I feel like almost like the tide has turned in some weird way.
*  Like it's kind of coming back.
*  It definitely has.
*  There were like these big moments.
*  I think like when they tried to cancel you and that didn't work.
*  Shane getting SNL.
*  Just like big things where it's kind of like, oh, they're almost admitting,
*  okay, we lost the great censor comedian's war.
*  But for those years, I think it was good to have Legion of Skanks for a lot of those.
*  For a lot of those comics.
*  I was just like, well, this is the place where you could still do whatever you wanted to.
*  Yeah, we were just opening the door a little bit to say fucked up shit.
*  And people would come on our show.
*  I mean, the amount of times people were like, dude, should I have not said that on your show after they leave?
*  But you guys did a wise thing too though, because you were subscription based.
*  Right?
*  So for the longest time, if you wanted to find out what you guys were talking about,
*  you had to subscribe.
*  So you had loyal subscribers.
*  But I was a little just kind of like planning on that too, is to kind of keep ourselves a little safe from...
*  Well, yeah, we have our own platform.
*  And we put out the version on YouTube.
*  We put it out on iTunes, but we play by the rules there.
*  So we edit out all the shit you can't say on those platforms.
*  If you want to see the real version the way that we do it, you got to go subscribe.
*  And honestly, with YouTube, the way they started censoring everything, it actually now,
*  because we've been doing this for like eight years, but now more than ever,
*  a platform that we have is more important than ever.
*  Because now YouTube is super strict with everything we do.
*  We have to bleep things.
*  We have to censor things.
*  There's certain topics we can't even put in the podcast.
*  It's so wild that there's only really one YouTube.
*  Like if you had to predict at the beginning of the internet when they first started putting videos
*  and those little media players you'd get with Windows,
*  who the fuck would have ever thought there would only be one streaming site that anybody cares about?
*  There's a few other ones, but nobody...
*  Well, they don't, but I'm saying no one cares.
*  So like Google is like the search engine, but there's a whole bunch of other ones.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, Google also bought out YouTube, and it was so smart the way they did it.
*  But yeah, you can't go to...
*  No offense to Rumble.
*  When you put the podcast on Rumble, nobody watches it.
*  There's a few shows that have big audiences on Rumble.
*  Yeah, because they can't be as big as Rumble.
*  Yes, that's kind of the dynamic.
*  And it is...
*  Google and YouTube, which are one and the same now,
*  it is amazing how they just became the thing for something that...
*  There's no clear reason why there should be one thing.
*  But nobody is like...
*  If you say something and you go, is that true?
*  And I go, yeah, bing it.
*  Well, the YouTube thing though, it's like they have it so dialed in.
*  It's like the recommendation is so high.
*  It's like, yeah, I'm going to do it.
*  It's like, yeah, I'm going to do it.
*  It's like, yeah, I'm going to do it.
*  They are just dialed in.
*  It's like the recommendations and there's constant...
*  You could go down rabbit hole after rabbit hole after rabbit hole
*  and never find the end
*  and be endlessly entertained
*  and it encourages you to keep looking at other stuff,
*  keep showing you other stuff constantly.
*  And all the power in the universe is that algorithm now.
*  And all the power in the universe is that algorithm now.
*  It's insane how much...
*  But that particularly...
*  how much power...
*  And if YouTube decides,
*  we're going to push this person,
*  They could make someone one of the most influential people in the world.
*  So the industry is because, it's not even like the industry, the industry has become
*  tech nerds that are like in charge of all these algorithms and they can like, who knows
*  how it works?
*  Who knows when they just pick and choose and what they choose?
*  All I know is YouTube thinks I want to see Ben Shapiro a lot more than I want to see
*  Ben Shapiro.
*  YouTube's like, I'm pretty sure you're going to love this guy.
*  I don't know how comfortable, I told you yesterday, right, the guy's name I asked you about because
*  I just found him yesterday, it was Kirk.
*  Charlie Kirk?
*  Charlie Kirk.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He's big.
*  I'm going to be your yell at college kids.
*  That's the video.
*  That is such a weird one.
*  That is such a weird one.
*  When you sit down with like young kids that don't know what the fuck they're talking about,
*  they've never been on camera ever and you give them a microphone, it's, you know, even
*  if they're willing to sign the release, 19 year olds don't know what the fuck they're
*  saying.
*  Well the one girl, one girl was getting dominated.
*  One girl was getting dominated on the thing that I was going to say that like, she even
*  says it where I do, like even though I'm kind of like, lady, you sound dumb, I felt generally
*  bad for her when she goes, he gave her like some kind of smarmy like, blah, blah, blah,
*  you know, and she just kind of goes, she's like, well I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm nervous,
*  like I don't talk on microphone a lot, like I think you do, so like, I'm sorry, and I
*  was almost like, yeah dude, like you're good.
*  Of course.
*  You're like, housing her and when no one, she says something and everyone's around and
*  starts booing and she starts kind of like smiling, but it's not a smile of like, bring
*  it on, she's doing the smile of like, I don't know what to do, like she's like, scary, I've
*  just been frozen before a lot, it makes me feel bad for her.
*  Not only that, but then that girl now is internet famous, right?
*  So, did she really understand what she was doing?
*  Like, did she really understand what the consequences of that are, when you're 19 or whatever age
*  she is?
*  Also, if you're an adult and you're arguing with a child, a 19 year old, a 20 year old,
*  the goal of it, it should always be with the tone of like, well look, let me give you something
*  to consider, like maybe, I get why you feel that way, but like, hey maybe look at it this
*  way, it should never be like, I want to have the crowd go, oh, you destroy, it's like,
*  What are you doing?
*  It's almost like, when you ever see like a comedian who's like a kid, like a 16 or a
*  15 year old kid, like, I just have a hard time ever really enjoying him, because I'm
*  going like, you have no idea, you've lived absolutely no experiences, you have no like,
*  perspective on the world or anything, maybe you understand it, it's all a joke, but it's
*  kind of, yeah.
*  Oh, that's what it does, that's what it does, making someone famous on America's Got Talent,
*  something like that, and you're like, what do you do?
*  I became friends with Chapelle when he was 19, I saw Chapelle when he was 19, he was
*  doing like,
*  And he was also savant though.
*  He was, but he also did a thing that was really interesting, where he would do outside shows,
*  he would just throw a hat down, and start doing stand up on the street, no, anywhere.
*  He did it in Montreal, he did it right in front of the club soda.
*  We did a show, and then Chapelle goes outside and fucking does stand up to people in the
*  street, and they all gathered round, and he was doing stand up in the street in Montreal,
*  crushing, crushing, crushing.
*  This was him at 19.
*  Yeah.
*  So no, he's not famous at all.
*  Maybe he's a couple years older by then.
*  Maybe he was.
*  Well, 19 he got his first deal.
*  So this was, this was 94, I want to say.
*  I did the Montreal Comedy Festival with him, and I met him in like, 91, somewhere around
*  then.
*  So what, how old was Dave in 1991?
*  That will,
*  He did Robin Hood Men in Tights when he was 19, I believe.
*  Dude, he was, it was crazy, like he would do this thing where he would just do stand
*  up out to people.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He would just do stand up on the street.
*  It was the craziest thing he'd ever seen, man.
*  I wouldn't do that.
*  If anybody did that now and put it on video, we would all muck them.
*  But he learned how to do it from Charlie Barnett, and Charlie Barnett was like a famous New
*  York comic that got on Saturday Night Live but couldn't read.
*  Couldn't read, so that's how Eddie Murphy got the gig.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why he lost the gig, because he couldn't read the scripts.
*  Yeah, he was popular, he was pretty popular, Charlie Barnett was in DC cab, right, a couple
*  things, like.
*  He was a hilarious comic.
*  He was popping, and then yeah, he couldn't read the cue cards, so they had to hire Eddie
*  Murphy.
*  And I think he influenced Dave a lot in that, too, that like he saw Charlie doing those.
*  Better learn how to read, Dave.
*  You want to make it a misbusiness.
*  That poor guy, man, because he was super talented, supposedly.
*  The early influence of Tony Woods.
*  Tony Woods is so bad, too.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  But Tony Woods still is a hilarious dude.
*  He's great.
*  He's doing the festival this year, right?
*  He was there last year.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He did my podcast, then we went to the Vulcan and did a show, and he murdered, man.
*  It was hilarious.
*  Oh, he's a killer, dude, really, really funny.
*  He's like low energy, low energy in levels.
*  Charismatic, though.
*  He's just so good at engaging the crowd.
*  He's very good, as some comedians just have that gift of like luring you into their world.
*  Like Nate Barghetti's very like that.
*  Like when you watch him, you're just like, you slow down, and you just kind of like sink
*  into his speed.
*  I can't kill unless I'm yelling at the audience.
*  I'm screaming at the top of my lungs.
*  There's no two-in-one.
*  You're internal monologue, but isn't that your personality?
*  That's more of your personality.
*  That isn't true.
*  Like imagine if you were forced to do Stephen Wright's act.
*  You'd be like, this is not me.
*  But for Stephen Wright, it's perfect.
*  Yep.
*  For Stephen Wright, it's the fucking best act ever.
*  You're very low energy, and you kind of bring them into you, but it's very, you sit down,
*  which is like a...
*  That's by design, though, because...
*  You're lazy.
*  I said I watch them because I'm very lazy.
*  No, I watched Patrice.
*  It's a complete mimic of Patrice's things.
*  It was watching him go from standing to sitting and seeing that the crowd, some of the people
*  that took him in is very like...
*  He's looming over them and saying these crazy things.
*  Like being turned off by that to seeing when he was laying back and letting them come into
*  him, he could say...
*  Much more people embraced that.
*  They were leaning into him.
*  That makes sense.
*  And when you're a big guy...
*  So that's why I felt like it was a big presence.
*  I'm going to say all this kind of crazy shit.
*  When I'm over them, it looks like I'm pointing down at them.
*  Instead of letting them come into the stage.
*  That actually does make sense.
*  And also, they're sitting down too.
*  Why are you standing up?
*  Well, you're not moving around.
*  Unless you have some activity in your act.
*  If you've got some activity, if you've got some things you've got to act out a little
*  bit, I get it.
*  When I started in the black comedy clubs, I was doing a straight Chris Rock pace, nonstop,
*  a lot of direct finger point, you know what I'm talking about.
*  Yes, those are good.
*  Those juice the old act up.
*  Yeah, man.
*  It's interesting now too, because Kill Tony is sort of a similar situation as getting
*  interviewed by Charlie Kirk.
*  So these fucking dudes, for their first time ever, they do stand up and it's at Madison
*  Square Garden.
*  They're just like, what the fuck?
*  And they go out there and they're just frozen in the eyes of 16,000 people.
*  And that's going to be them forever.
*  Look at Mikey Bowman.
*  Look at Mikey Bowman.
*  This fucking idiot thought he was funny.
*  And then the comments, all your neighbors.
*  I got it right before me.
*  Just got booed.
*  I couldn't even hear what he got booed for.
*  I just know he followed a handicapped guy who gave a sweet emotional speech about being
*  handicappable and then he walked off.
*  And I said, the other guy just got there and they were like, fuck this biped piece of shit.
*  He was like, whatever it is, do it.
*  Shall I kill Tony?
*  If you're good looking, it's held against you pretty quickly.
*  It's like, fuck you, dude.
*  Where are your burn scars?
*  Like the rest of Earth.
*  The audience represents the rest of Earth.
*  When you see someone that's good looking and they're going to spotlight on them, fuck you.
*  It's like a natural inclination.
*  I think there's a subconscious thing though.
*  I think we good looking people, we want to grease the wheels for a little bit.
*  Good looking people have it pretty easy in life.
*  In comedy, it's just a weird thing.
*  You almost give them a little bit like-
*  Because humor is the weapon of the not good looking person.
*  So like counter at this.
*  So you're immediately going like, you're hot.
*  You don't have a fucking personality.
*  You're hot and funny.
*  Don't fuck yourself.
*  Exactly.
*  Even though there are good looking people who are hilarious and have good personalities,
*  but generally speaking-
*  Generally speaking, it's not likely.
*  Schumer had a thing one time.
*  I saw her on stage at the cellar once and it was about her and her boyfriend meeting
*  Kate Upton.
*  She walked away to go get something to drink, whatever, when he came back.
*  Her husband said to Amy, she's great man.
*  She said the funniest story.
*  I was like, fuck you dude.
*  It really is the idea of like, come on man, don't.
*  You learn to be funny.
*  People are like, dude, George Clooney, that prankster, he's the best.
*  That guy is the funniest dude.
*  He's fine at best, I'm sure.
*  Relax.
*  It's a personality trait to get laid.
*  We all learn to be funny when we're kids because we're not good looking enough to get laid
*  without it.
*  It's like, look, I either got to get funny or do donuts in the streets of Philadelphia.
*  It's easier to get funny.
*  I love when really good looking actors tell you who to vote for.
*  They're my favorite.
*  They're my favorite.
*  These are the guys with all the wisdom.
*  And then they're going to tell you.
*  They're the same guys I told you to get vaccinated to, by the way.
*  The best was early in it, like in March and April, when they would all take videos from
*  their mansion and be like, we're all in this together.
*  I would also stay home with $30 million in the bank.
*  Imagine twirling a Tom Collins with your finger on a raft.
*  If we go into apocalyptic times, do you think they'll look back on the shutting down of
*  the country for a year and a half as like the trigger that made society begin to collapse?
*  I don't think they will.
*  They'll never acknowledge they were wrong.
*  But we very objective historians.
*  You think they'll look back at this time and be like, this is the fall of Rome.
*  There's going to be a lot of books written about this period in time.
*  I think it's the Internet.
*  The Internet is the beginning of the end for everything.
*  But it's not because the Internet didn't shut the fucking country down for a year and a
*  half.
*  The Internet didn't do that.
*  That's the way they share the ideas that quickly.
*  Yeah, but it's a very specific group of people who decided that was a good idea.
*  You wouldn't have had anyone even fighting back against it if it wasn't for the Internet.
*  It would have all just been the CNN guys.
*  They would have pulled that off so much easier.
*  They would have scared the shit out of you.
*  You would never know.
*  Yeah, but if this happened in the 1980s, you would never know how many people died on respirators.
*  You would never know about any of that shit.
*  You wouldn't know about a goddamn thing they didn't want you to know about.
*  That's what's so scary about the media today.
*  When you hear about the Spanish flu, you're like, how do you know how many people died?
*  There was no Internet.
*  There was no way.
*  Yeah, by the time you got your horse to the next place with the information, more people
*  have died.
*  Bro, living back then, you were fucked.
*  If you lived in the city, the hygiene was insanely bad.
*  People would shit in these outhouses that were set up for the block.
*  They never presented that.
*  I think that always when I see you watch Tombstone and stuff and Kurt Russell and a girl went
*  off into the woods to go kiss and like, I bet her armpits smell like shit.
*  She has gum disease.
*  Everybody smelled like shit.
*  You had a shit in the hole in the ground.
*  They hadn't even invented toilet paper back then.
*  Who knows how they even wiped their ass?
*  Dude, you had to be so horny in the 1600s to just power through all of that to have sex.
*  This big hairy bush, it stinks.
*  I guess you'd just be like a dog.
*  I'm going to put my chin in your shit-covered ass cheeks and eat your disgustingly smelly
*  hairy pussy.
*  Dogs don't give a shit what anything smells like and I guess you just get used to stuff.
*  I guess so.
*  It was probably hot, dude.
*  Dude, a stinky pussy was probably hot in the 1600s.
*  By 1880, horses in New York City deposited four million pounds of manure on city streets
*  every day.
*  In dry weather, it would turn to fecal dust and choke pedestrians.
*  Vacant lots were filled with the waste.
*  These manure piles would rise up to 60 feet high.
*  Now it's called Staten Island.
*  Dude, if you fell from 60 feet, you're dead.
*  Save me all that shit about carbon emissions, by the way.
*  We're doing great.
*  This is way better than what it used to be.
*  Oh my god, you're breathing shit air.
*  Everyone was sick.
*  I'll tell you who is right now nodding their head.
*  He goes, yeah, that's why I'm the guy who invented that bag that goes behind the horse's
*  asses.
*  Isn't it amazing, though, that the invention of the internal combustion engine and the
*  adoption of cars by everybody and the abandonment of driving horses literally stopped there
*  from being shit air throughout every city street.
*  Shit air.
*  You've never been to Newark, Joe.
*  I was born in Newark.
*  I've been there.
*  It's not much better smelling in Newark.
*  I lived there in the 1990s.
*  Was it bad when you lived there?
*  It was horrible.
*  I lived with my grandfather to save enough money to get an apartment.
*  When I first moved to New York, I didn't have enough money for an apartment.
*  My grandfather lived on North 9th Street in Newark.
*  He was there from the blockbusting days.
*  He bought a house there in the 1940s or 50s.
*  In the 60s, they came by and they said, black people are moving into your neighborhood.
*  Sell now.
*  It was a real estate scam.
*  They would try to sell to black people and just get money out of all these houses.
*  My grandfather was an Italian community.
*  My grandfather was like, I love black people.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  Get out of here.
*  This is my house.
*  He wasn't moving.
*  Your grandfather is old enough also that he's like, I was the black person five minutes
*  ago.
*  Exactly.
*  What do you mean?
*  When he moved here, he came here straight from Italy.
*  He told me it was horrific.
*  The term WAP, I always think it was funny.
*  If you say around him, he would get angry.
*  Someone called somebody a guinea, he would get angry.
*  Classic WAP behavior.
*  Exactly.
*  He was a peaceful guy, but he would just get like, that was a terrible thing that they
*  used to call us when we were kids.
*  But that's not that long ago, man.
*  No, it's all basically across the country, even in California, but all the areas that
*  you think of as the hood, it's like Oakland or Compton or Newark or Crown Heights or any
*  of those, those were all white areas up until the 60s.
*  Then a bunch of black people from the south came up and then all the white people left.
*  And they did do these scams.
*  A lot of it was pushed by these real estate guys and they would purposely fuck up a neighborhood
*  to make money off of it.
*  Then there was redlining where they wouldn't sell to black people outside certain lines.
*  That was a Baltimore issue, too.
*  My grandmother, it was funny, the neighborhood I grew up in was Jewish and black and then
*  down the next neighborhood I was Italian.
*  Everyone started, it became predominantly black by the time I moved up.
*  My grandmother, until like two years before she died and was in a nursing home, stayed
*  in that house and did not scare the old people at all.
*  As it changed around them, it didn't scare, there would be literally people on her front
*  step like her neighbors, like a bunch of teenagers rapping with a loud stereo and she would just
*  be like, oh, they're nice.
*  At least they're not trans.
*  They call me Miss Jeanette and so whatever.
*  My grandma was delightfully racist.
*  She didn't give a fuck.
*  My grandma wrote in her mind the only brown person at the table had the most racist white
*  grandmother.
*  Like openly racist.
*  She didn't give a shit.
*  My Aunt Anne Marie, to this day she's a little racist.
*  The penalty of being a Puerto Rican that's racist is less than the penalty of being an
*  Irish.
*  She was Italian.
*  I'm half Italian-Irish.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  No, they would literally, I would be at the dinner table and I remember one Thanksgiving
*  my grandma said, because I was getting picked on by white kids in the neighborhood because
*  it was like a white trash neighborhood and I was the only brown kid and my grandma was
*  like, you know, it's not his fault that he's an N-word.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  She was right.
*  She was right.
*  It's not your fault.
*  You didn't choose it.
*  It's not my fault.
*  Yeah, that's what the original Goodwill hunting was.
*  Not you, Grandma.
*  Not you.
*  I just go hug black people in Goodwill hunting them is what I call it.
*  It's not your fault.
*  What's not my fault?
*  It's not your fault.
*  Not you, Jay.
*  Not you, dude.
*  Not you, dude, it's Jay.
*  Have you guys seen that Matt Walsh movie?
*  Am I racist?
*  I haven't seen that.
*  I watched the trailer today.
*  What's it out on?
*  It's really funny.
*  I heard great things about it.
*  It's a top 10 movie in the country right now.
*  I think it's like, what number is it?
*  Well, the first one was great.
*  Which is crazy, dude.
*  It's got no press, no press reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but customer views is 99%, which
*  is wild.
*  Yeah.
*  Like no one will review it.
*  Why?
*  Because it's funny.
*  And he's not being sanctimonious.
*  He's not talking down to people or preaching to them.
*  He's just showing how nutty all these fucking people are in these struggle sessions with
*  white people.
*  The other one was great.
*  What is a woman?
*  It's better than that because this one's really funny.
*  What does a woman at certain times...
*  Well, the trailer says it's a comedy.
*  It calls it a comedy.
*  It is a comedy.
*  I don't think the other one really was pushed as that.
*  But he's essentially doing a right-wing version of one of those Sacha Baron Cohen type shows.
*  He's essentially doing that.
*  He's sitting down with these people and he's pretending that he is with them and he wants
*  to know how he could do better.
*  Number seven.
*  Number seven in the fucking country with no press, man.
*  It made two and a half million this weekend.
*  Do you know how nutty that is to have no press and have a show take off and become a top
*  ten movie in the country?
*  It's pretty wild.
*  No press reviews at all.
*  It's an interesting time, man.
*  It's interesting.
*  And it is like...
*  The thing that was real interesting about the first one, and I think probably is true
*  about this, although I haven't seen it yet, is that even though he's obviously a real
*  right-winger, it's not like that's the movie.
*  The movie isn't even making a right-wing argument or anything like that.
*  It's just letting these crazy left-wingers showcase how crazy they are.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay, you tell them.
*  Like, it was nuts.
*  He just went up to these, in the first one that I did see, he just went up to these gender
*  experts and just kept asking them what a woman is.
*  It was crazy.
*  And they all just collapse into themselves.
*  This is the toughest question they've ever thought of.
*  The trans woman he asked outside was the best because he was like, well, what is a woman?
*  And she goes, I think I want to go.
*  They've made it, they've tried to boil it down.
*  I think I saw somebody do this the other day, too, like try to come up with a logical explanation.
*  It was something really ridiculous.
*  Although recognizing that there are biological differences, a woman is anybody who tells
*  you they're a woman.
*  While recognizing biolink.
*  So this is like the loophole.
*  While recognizing that Harry probably can't get pregnant, he is now Harietta.
*  And that's just it.
*  That's just it.
*  There's no conversation that can be had here.
*  And in some countries they're talking about jailing people.
*  Was it Scotland that had something about a proposal about literally jailing people for
*  misgendering people?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, that's like a big discussion always.
*  Yeah.
*  But they were talking about putting people in a fucking cage.
*  Yeah, that's insane.
*  Find out where that was.
*  Was that in Scotland?
*  No, it didn't.
*  That's the thing that happened in Canada.
*  In Canada, a guy got sent to jail for mis-.
*  He wouldn't agree to call his son a daughter or vice versa.
*  I mean, how many people are actually legitimately trans?
*  It's like 0.001% of people are actually trans.
*  Now it's way higher than that with young people because there's not a real thing to be in
*  trans anymore.
*  I was three steps away from racing my cars and doing donuts and also three steps away
*  from becoming trans.
*  Yeah, it's next door neighbors.
*  They're just like moonies.
*  By the way, you can join up, man.
*  You can join up.
*  I just wanted to fit in with somebody.
*  Most ironically, if you were Asian, you would have been better at both things.
*  Maybe.
*  Well, you would have been a tough sale as a chick.
*  No, dude, I'm a tough sale.
*  First of all, me and Dave dressed up as chicks years ago to make fun of the guys we fucked
*  podcast.
*  We mocked them.
*  We did a sketch dressing up as them and I looked fucking good.
*  I'm sure you did, but there's not a lot of dudes are going to want to climb you.
*  I'm going to.
*  You're intimidating lady.
*  You're a big lady, man.
*  You're scary.
*  Yeah.
*  If I decide to go to jail, people for misgendering is false.
*  And look at the Elad's picture.
*  Why did he get brought in?
*  What is the actual truth?
*  What is the actual truth?
*  If I became a woman, I already know what I'm fucking skinny black.
*  Is misgendering your crime?
*  What does it say?
*  According to law professor, according to Adam Tompkins, oh, one guy for a while.
*  Trust him.
*  Misgendering could only be considered a hate crime if it was done in a way that a reasonable
*  person would consider to be threatening or abusive.
*  Wait a minute.
*  That's pretty vague.
*  That means yes.
*  That doesn't mean no.
*  That doesn't mean it's false.
*  That means you just if that's how you're going to write it out, that in quotes, a reasonable
*  person would consider to be threatening or abusive.
*  Who the fuck is reasonable?
*  How many people do you know that are reasonable?
*  And also threatening?
*  They're going to be able to decide whether or not you should be jailed?
*  Well, threatening is a little bit more concrete than abusive.
*  Abusive is really vague.
*  Like what do you mean?
*  Verbally abusive?
*  If you're a hundred pound man and Lewis calls you a man name and you want to be called a
*  woman's name, that could be threatening.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  That could be threatening.
*  I mean, I also would have been threatening the guy, to be honest.
*  Why are you being a woman?
*  Why are you being a woman?
*  Headbutt.
*  That's a weird thing.
*  Misgendering would only be considered a hate crime if it was done under what?
*  Okay.
*  What does it say below that?
*  According to Adam Tompkins, a law professor and former conservative MSP, asserting that
*  sex is a biological fact or that it is not changed just by virtue of the gender by which
*  someone chooses to identify is not and never can be a hate crime under this legislation.
*  Okay.
*  So he's saying that like dead naming someone will never be a crime.
*  No, but see, even this is in a kind of a little bit vague way because he's saying asserting
*  that sex is a biological fact.
*  So if I just say men are men and women are women, that's not changed by can calling an
*  individual, like could be like, no, you're not a woman.
*  You're a man.
*  Could that be considered abusive or whatever?
*  It's all the interpretation.
*  Like what is that?
*  You know, that's a very good point because this is just step one, right?
*  That's what it seems like to me.
*  Right, right, right.
*  So this is not saying no, arguing with them.
*  No, you're a man.
*  It says it's not changed by virtue of the gender by which someone chooses to identify
*  is not and never can be a hate crime.
*  But yeah, that is weird because like asserting that it's a biological fact, but like what
*  if you're arguing?
*  What if you're saying you're a man?
*  Is that harassment now?
*  Fuck you.
*  I'm a woman.
*  You're a fucking man.
*  And if you're getting in one of those exchanges, what's that then?
*  Yeah.
*  If I call somebody an asshole, they're not literally an asshole, right?
*  So like technically, isn't it all just sort of like deciding what words have power on
*  what words don't?
*  100% because if you're not swearing and this person swearing back at you that wants to
*  be called the woman, fuck you, you fucking cocksucker.
*  I am a woman.
*  And you're like, no, you're not.
*  You're a dude.
*  Like you're like standing your ground in that situation.
*  That could also be the case.
*  What if you don't threaten them?
*  But like if you hypothetically, like if that dude was like, I am a woman and I was like,
*  if you were a woman, I'd slap the shit out of you right now.
*  But you're a man.
*  So I'm afraid you might beat my ass.
*  So I didn't actually threaten them.
*  That's a good balance because you're putting yourself in the, you're not saying you'd,
*  I beat your ass.
*  You're saying I'm going to get fucked up.
*  So I don't know.
*  Do you train?
*  What's to be said?
*  That's very well phrased.
*  What's to be said for feeling how you feel and also just not giving a shit?
*  Do you know what I'm saying?
*  I feel like as I said before, I think they should not give hormones or any kind of operations
*  to children to, you know, change their gender.
*  I'm saying, but I don't, but also if they're like, they're not making it illegal.
*  They're doing it.
*  I'm like, well now I want to see a five year old with tits.
*  Like now I want to see it.
*  I'm against it.
*  I just want to go, they did it.
*  They already did it.
*  So I'm going to go, let me see.
*  You're not even allowed to say that.
*  To say what?
*  A five, but it's a boy's tits.
*  That's the thing that's weird.
*  It's like that with the weird, the nipple thing is odd, right?
*  Didn't New York City, didn't they free the nipple where you can walk around with your
*  tits out?
*  Yeah.
*  Once in a while.
*  In the park.
*  Is there ever a pair that you're really looking forward to seeing?
*  Rarely, but once in a while in a park, you'll see a nice pair of tits.
*  In Austin.
*  Just fully topless?
*  What's the spring called Barton Springs?
*  So it's top tops are optional there for girls.
*  I brought my son there, dude.
*  He was 10 years old and I just saw him staring at this girl's tits and it's all hot chicks.
*  It's all like hot Austin chicks.
*  Of course they're being free.
*  They did ketamine.
*  Yay!
*  And I remember James was just fucking keyed in on this girl's tits and I was like, hey,
*  what are you doing?
*  He was like, oh, it's natural, dad.
*  Mom says the body's natural, so.
*  Mom says.
*  Mom says.
*  The fuck is she talking to you about?
*  Bro, imagine what people were like before they had clothes.
*  Then just like chimps, just fucking every chance they could just trees and shit.
*  Imagine before people figured out clothes, how wild it was.
*  I think we figured them out pretty early on in the game.
*  Clothes?
*  Yeah.
*  It was a leaf you put over your head.
*  No, no, no.
*  It's like millions of years of being sub-human hominids.
*  What I should say is I think pretty early in the game of being humans.
*  So like whenever they're like, they trace like the genetic to like, this is when we
*  consider you like a modern homo sapien.
*  Especially when we came out of the water, our dicks were so small.
*  You threw something on quick.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  I think it was all climate based.
*  I think in Africa, like, I mean, how much they probably covered their dicks.
*  Well, in Africa there's still parks there.
*  If you go to like some places on the Amazon that are totally buck naked.
*  Well, in Africa they have to cover their dicks otherwise it's dangerous.
*  You don't need to.
*  Just tie it back like a hair bun.
*  Like they didn't need to stay warm, right?
*  So I think it was only when people started moving.
*  Yeah, you might be right about that.
*  I think it's a migration thing.
*  Because where human life evolved is the same area where like a lot of different primates
*  evolved besides us.
*  Human beings got to Europe.
*  The NIM got closed.
*  They got to Europe and they went, all right, let's cover our dicks and build some shit.
*  I know in the Bible they says it was like, you know, God gave us embarrassment at one
*  point or whatever.
*  When do we really start getting embarrassed?
*  It was cold.
*  Who was the first guy that was like, oh, my dick is small.
*  I don't want people to see this.
*  I hope we don't find out or Sebastian's not going to have anything to talk about.
*  Aren't you embarrassed?
*  I think it's as soon as we started moving to places where it was cold and then we don't
*  see people's dicks and pussies all day long, it kind of changes your behavior.
*  And it probably led to us like saying, listen, we need a city and we need a wall.
*  Block all these wild motherfuckers, these bare dick motherfuckers from coming over the hills.
*  That's probably what happened.
*  Probably people got started getting really shy, but it was covering themselves up with
*  animal skins to stay warm.
*  But why was it having a small dick?
*  I need to get to the bottom of this.
*  What was the problem with having a small dick that everyone was like, you need to cover
*  that little dick up?
*  You know?
*  Well, you know, the Romans thought that having a big dick was gross.
*  The big dick was a sign.
*  That's why they had little dicks and all those giant dudes.
*  The odds of, if you look at some of Michelangelo's statues, the odds of those guys not having
*  a massive hog are very small.
*  That is a dude built like Francis in Gano.
*  You know?
*  All of those kings and all those important people, they literally commissioned them to
*  build them like they were gods and they would build the statues bigger than the statues
*  of gods, right?
*  And you would think that they would give a big fat hog just to fucking hammer.
*  They all have little tiny dicks.
*  Because they thought of...
*  That's just the artist's signature.
*  Some person, just like the same people that are tricking people into thinking your cat
*  can be non-binary, somebody back then tricked them into thinking that big dicks are bad.
*  And it's probably some conniving little dick thing.
*  Some genius.
*  Some little motherfucker who's figured out a way to...
*  Is he a child from Asia?
*  He's like, oh, Saul.
*  There was a brilliant...
*  Eww!
*  Get your bigot dick out of here!
*  Oh, look at the hog on that guy though.
*  What's that one from?
*  He's a Greek god, I don't know.
*  Oh my god.
*  Look at his fucking dong.
*  Look at his dong.
*  Look at all the extra skin he's got in front of his dong.
*  That guy must be libertarian.
*  It looks like a fucking hawk's face.
*  By the way, that's the only one that's uncircumcised of all these.
*  Well, once they're hard, it pops out.
*  Look at these animals.
*  Jesus!
*  What is that from?
*  My bedroom.
*  Same guy.
*  That's why I keep my bracelets on.
*  But look at that one right there.
*  The guy has a tiny dick.
*  The one in the...
*  No, yeah, right there.
*  Look at that.
*  Tiny dick.
*  Insane!
*  It's so...
*  Yeah, but everybody can't stay fucking boned up while they're posing for the fucking statue.
*  Yeah, Jesus Christ, Joe.
*  Leave the man alone.
*  It's not a bad dick.
*  I think it's weird that that guy was so hard.
*  No, no, that's normal.
*  That's normal.
*  He's walking around, Heil Hitler and with the giant rod.
*  He goes, oh, Michelangelo, paint this.
*  Go back to...
*  Sculpt this one.
*  Bro, I don't care what your excuse is.
*  If anybody ever gets a picture of you, Heil Hitler, and with the...
*  Go back to that picture.
*  With the big car.
*  With the giant hog.
*  The one that you just had with the guy, Heil Hitler.
*  His hand was upside down.
*  It was clearly Heil Hitler to me, bro.
*  Is it the one, the white one?
*  Yeah, that one right there.
*  Click on that.
*  Bro, that's Heil Hitler.
*  That's not the one though.
*  He's walking like an injection, Joe.
*  That's not the one you had.
*  That one's freakier.
*  This one looks like more modern.
*  This guy's playing music to his dick.
*  That last one looked like she was wearing high heels.
*  What was the one you just had up, Jamie?
*  It is...
*  Oh, that one right there.
*  That one right there.
*  To the left.
*  No, no, no.
*  In the middle.
*  The gray one.
*  Up one row.
*  Up one row.
*  Up one row.
*  To the right.
*  That's it.
*  Bam.
*  Bro, that guy's Heil Hitler.
*  That's how it started.
*  It started like this, and then they flipped it over.
*  It's like how you turn over a punch.
*  He was getting ready to give a fucking strong one.
*  Look, the guy's got a giant heart on.
*  He's very excited.
*  He's Nazi on the left side and gay on the right side.
*  I was going to say, they really are.
*  They make them sort of flamboyant-y, too.
*  Jamie, go back to that one and give us a description.
*  What does that mean?
*  I think it's all the same guy.
*  Who is the guy?
*  I think it's the guy with the big dick.
*  Don Lucas.
*  Some kind of a job.
*  Oh, okay.
*  What's his name?
*  Greek God of Fertility, probably.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go, champ.
*  He's the only guy with a big dick in any of that art.
*  There are so many different versions of him, though.
*  Sometimes his dick is reasonable.
*  You know?
*  Really big, but reasonable.
*  Well, different states.
*  Sometimes he just fucks.
*  Sometimes he just goes out of the shower.
*  But like the Sieg Heil one, he looked pretty reasonable.
*  Right?
*  It was a reasonable dick.
*  It was a big dick.
*  But some of them were like, hey, man, come on.
*  I mean, there's no way.
*  I've just gotten to an age now where I just go around the locker room completely naked
*  now for the first time in my life.
*  I think it's funny.
*  The men's locker, right?
*  The men's locker room.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Men's, women, children.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  Lucas is in there.
*  I don't like it.
*  I don't like it.
*  I don't like it at all.
*  And taking a little bouncy dick walk to a shower.
*  Nuts.
*  My little bird.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, fuck that.
*  Do you guys hear about that Canadian guy who was 50 years old who identified as a teenage
*  girl?
*  He wanted to do a swim meet with teenage girls.
*  And they were letting him.
*  That is the next step.
*  I believe there was like an argument.
*  See if it's true.
*  If they let him actually into the locker room.
*  I want to make sure that this is true.
*  Like a girl's locker room.
*  Can you imagine you have a teenager?
*  What a dream.
*  It's going to do a swimming event.
*  Oh, this is like attached to a school.
*  50 year old trans swimmer shared locker room while competing against teens.
*  Yeah, it's awesome.
*  And this is this is how this is how crazy Canada has gotten.
*  This is just like the moonies.
*  They're just like the juggalos.
*  Like they're in a cult.
*  They don't realize they're in a cult.
*  But if you think this is a good idea to let a 50 year old guy who decides to identify
*  as a woman change in a locker room with teenage girls because he identifies as a teenage girl,
*  you're out of your fucking mind.
*  Ladies, ladies.
*  It's just a bunch of us gals in here.
*  Let me be clear that this does this person say they identify as a teenage girl?
*  This was a plan that I would have drummed up when I was 12 years old.
*  I don't think that it was an event that teenage girls could be 16 and older.
*  I think she's a locker.
*  She's going to a woman's locker room in general.
*  OK, 16 and older.
*  This person's competing in a 16 and older.
*  So you could be any age.
*  OK, so does is there any evidence this person identifies as a teenage girl or is that just
*  the Internet?
*  Sounds like the Internet, but I don't know.
*  Google that just in case.
*  I would like to know because that makes it extra crazy and fun.
*  I'd be weird if I.
*  It doesn't make it extra crazy and fun that people like, OK, it's the same way I feel
*  about all the other things we talked about.
*  Like the odds of you not being out of your fucking mind are really low.
*  They're really low.
*  We're super low.
*  And the fact that everyone's like, yeah, inclusivity like.
*  Well, also, how?
*  How did we get to this Moony point?
*  There's also we you should be allowed to say that some things are weird and crazy.
*  And that doesn't necessarily mean you have to hate them or be against them.
*  Comedians are weird and crazy.
*  I'm like, we're all weird and crazy.
*  OK.
*  Apparently, that means Wiseheart was swimming with young girls because of how fast or slow
*  a swimmer is, not because she identifies as a young girl.
*  But the competition is presumably separated by gender.
*  So there's an issue where Wiseheart is competing against females while being biologically male
*  and also, I think, intact.
*  So which is also the weird one, right?
*  You could be a woman, but you don't even have to try that.
*  Or no, you don't have to.
*  Sorry.
*  Turn around real quick and hit you with my pussy on your back.
*  And you can go back and forth.
*  And you don't have to choose.
*  I'll call you your name if you cut your dick off.
*  Does anybody ever cut your dick off?
*  I'm not going to I'm not going to call you or maybe I will call your name, but I might
*  fuck it up.
*  But I think that's OK.
*  Either way, he's going to check and we'll figure out.
*  We'll go from there.
*  It's just so nuts, man, that you're just given this pervert pass.
*  That like allows because there's real trans people that are like this.
*  Like it's happened for all eternity.
*  There's something wiring.
*  You feel female.
*  But there's also crazy people.
*  There's also real perverts and you give a pervert a Willy Wonka golden ticket.
*  I've got real good.
*  I've got real good at calling people the gender they want if they like I still will fuck it
*  up.
*  But I find I'm pretty good at if they look like a girl, if it's a guy transitioning to
*  a girl and they look like a girl.
*  I say I'm pretty good at all the she.
*  But if I almost if I fuck it up, look at yourself.
*  That means that you you're not shaving enough for you haven't done whatever it is to make
*  me call you.
*  I'm pretty good at calling them trans girls.
*  Girls.
*  That's also a weird thing to get stuck on because you're just you have to agree to this
*  thing and you have to agree to it.
*  This especially if you knew the person as one thing at one point in time and then they
*  decided to change their name and gender.
*  I mean, like, you know, a lot of attention, like what's going on here?
*  This is strange.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're getting mad if I fuck it up and call you Harry.
*  Well, that's the weirdest part of all of it is like you can't like be mad at someone,
*  especially if it's a mistake.
*  That's why I was saying, ma'am.
*  So I'm saying the Internet is such a bad place for it because everyone has such balls.
*  Everyone's a keyboard warrior on the Internet.
*  Even people that are like, you know, you know, bleeding heart liberals and people that are
*  looking to, you know, you know, they just they find a place to go and have this voice.
*  Back in the day, if you were trans and you were like a man that was dressed up as a woman
*  and you wanted to get mad at somebody about it, you had to get in their fucking face.
*  It wasn't going to happen.
*  And if you went to the village in New York City, they did.
*  They did get in your face.
*  You get aggressive.
*  You get beat up in the West Village by a trans chick.
*  Well, what's the one?
*  That's why I loved the that was the GameStop video, right?
*  Yeah.
*  The famous one, right?
*  I was like, it's ma'am.
*  Yes, I'm calling me, sir.
*  And then it's like, that's not how ma'am's talk.
*  GameStop nerd just going like, OK, sir.
*  Oh, it's like kicking over PlayStation.
*  That's the problem that women are having is that these men who decide that they're women
*  are now invent they're entering into these places that are just women's only and women's
*  events and women's things.
*  They're dominating like men do.
*  It was one of the very it was one of the very few points that I've had, like seeing that
*  other side of it that I didn't for a long time.
*  So kind of recently is like the the argument sports is almost like, oh, they're going to
*  dominate and kick ass.
*  And it's basically a guy beating up a girl in this fight and all those things.
*  But then it was it was a scholarship thing.
*  I don't know why that never dawned on me before.
*  It's like, no, these girls are like, no, I was going to be like the number one recruit
*  out of my school for sure.
*  And then this girl came in and made me look like I'm terrible because she's six foot five
*  and, you know, thirty five pounds more than me.
*  Yeah, it's nuts. You're letting people cheat.
*  You literally there's a reason why Title 9 was invented.
*  It was invented so that women could be able to compete with other women.
*  And you can't have an exemption for that just based on feelings, because it's not about
*  feelings. It's about fairness in sports.
*  And the only way to make it fair is if you're an intact biological male, you have to
*  compete against intact biological males.
*  Yeah, it's just you could still call yourself Debbie.
*  Get an aisle for Debbie.
*  You're in lane four.
*  You're competing against Mark and Steve.
*  But is there no fuck?
*  We're not children.
*  It's just we're not a rational sect of the trans community.
*  I don't know if I've ever heard someone in the trans community come out and agree with
*  that sentiment. Oh, yes.
*  You shouldn't. Oh, no, no, no.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And there's a bunch. There's a bunch of people who are trans who are like basically come out
*  and say, like, look, I know I'm not a woman.
*  I know I'm a man.
*  And yeah, we shouldn't be we shouldn't be around kids.
*  We shouldn't be competing in women's sports.
*  There's there's a decent we should be around kids at all.
*  Blair White goes to these these events where like trans people and she gets like called a Nazi
*  and kicked out. Yeah.
*  It's because she's a huge cock.
*  That was a sculpture.
*  That was her.
*  No, I think she's gone through the whole thing.
*  That's the it's like one day they're going to be able to manipulate chromosomes where you're
*  not going to ever have to worry about that again.
*  They're going to be able to change you to a woman.
*  You're going to actually be able to do it.
*  I don't know if they're going to be able to do it to us, but some somebody's lifetime from the in
*  the future, there's going to be people that are like, you know, people like serial divorces that
*  could be getting married and divorced, getting people to go back and forth man to woman, man to
*  woman. They're just going to be pigs.
*  They're just going to be dirty, greedy pigs.
*  They just want to fuck and get fucked.
*  And just to have a good year.
*  I thought myself last week as a whore or like a womanizer goes, I guess I was a bit of a
*  woman in my 20s and then I did my 30s as a guy.
*  Yeah, some women are going to be looking for men who've only been men the whole time.
*  Well, that's the shit that's really weird is you get teenagers that like they change and then a few
*  years later, they were like, oh, yeah, it was a phase.
*  Of course, especially these poor girls that are getting mastectomies.
*  And that's what I call it.
*  It's making a choice of goth at one point.
*  Yeah, imagine eyeliner tattooed in your eye when you were 16.
*  The crazy thing is you don't let them get tattooed, but you will let them get gender
*  alternating surgery, which is just bananas.
*  Is that happening?
*  By the way, gender affirming, excuse me, gender affirming surgery.
*  Not a lot. Not a lot of surgeries under 18.
*  There is a lot.
*  And when I say a lot, I think tens of thousands of like chemical shit like the
*  all of it.
*  Do you blockers?
*  There's plenty of girls that are getting mastectomies very young.
*  There's photographs of them.
*  If you're doing that before you're an adult, you don't know what the fuck you're doing.
*  It's insane. It's insane.
*  It's insane. It's just not what people are agreeing to.
*  It just to be kind.
*  Look, there's also a real debate with surgeries like that about whether that should be
*  allowed even after you're an adult.
*  And like, I'm not I'm not even allowed.
*  But I didn't Steve will be allowed to get fake tits if he wants to.
*  But listen, I'm not even saying that, though.
*  Yeah, he got out of that.
*  He's not doing it.
*  He's even too much for Steve.
*  I think he thought it was dangerous.
*  Yeah, it was retarded.
*  Well, you also have to cut the muscle on a dude, I think.
*  All I'm saying is there's yeah, that's tough.
*  You have to go up in there.
*  It's got to pump out.
*  Yeah, I don't think I think Steve made the right call.
*  I mean, it would have been a great bit.
*  But I think that's the only way it would have stuck out because I don't think he has enough
*  tissue in the front to give you like a traditional regular type boob job.
*  All right, I'll do it.
*  But my point is like next man up, if you're a grown woman and you're 40 years old, you
*  decide to get your boobs removed.
*  Who the fuck am I to say you shouldn't be able to do that?
*  Listen, I kind of I look I'm a libertarian.
*  I tend to agree with you.
*  But if there's if there was a doctor and you ask them to just like remove my fully functioning
*  left arm because I identify as a right one armed person or whatever, and doctors were
*  like, no, I'm not.
*  I'm unwilling to like perform a surgery on you.
*  They do boob jobs.
*  They do so many elective surgeries that there's an elective preventative surgery that a lot
*  of women do if they think they have that gene for breast cancer.
*  That's what I'm doing.
*  That's a little different.
*  OK, Steve was supposed to level of said, but the person in the supermarket spoke to Steve
*  O about the level of oppression that the trans people face in a pretty heartbreaking way,
*  which made him realize, wow, maybe it's not all fun and games.
*  After this, fear to stunt would seem like an exercise in celebrating violence against
*  trans people.
*  And he decided to call it off.
*  So that's why he called it off.
*  I thought it was just this is insane.
*  I'll tell you what, I have a feeling he was like, I don't want to do this.
*  But then you can really get out of it by doing making a nice speech like that.
*  That's pretty great.
*  That would be a good move because you're going to ruin your tits forever.
*  And then you'd have to go under another time to get them removed.
*  And then you'd always have scars on your your tits and your 50.
*  Someone you're afraid to fight, they're going to fight you after school and you go,
*  just what's that? When do we break the cycle of violence?
*  He's going to dress up and go to a biker rally.
*  I guess that was part of it.
*  Oh, you get it.
*  He thought it would get a crazy reaction out of a motorcycle riders who were checking me
*  out before realizing who he was.
*  I would have considered to be better footage if I was to be beaten up
*  at the motorcycle rally, he said.
*  You know, but the thing is, like, you could get fake tits put on you by prosthetic people.
*  The same people that did like the Penguin.
*  You ever see what's his name?
*  Handsome fella.
*  Colin Farrell.
*  Colin Farrell. Handsome fella.
*  Right. They made him look disgusting for the Penguin.
*  Like, yeah, they can give you tits, bro.
*  You don't have to get them.
*  Yeah. It'll look indistinguishable.
*  Yeah. And it's the same fucking stunt.
*  Marilyn Manson.
*  But that's a painting, isn't it?
*  That was a prosthetic.
*  No, but it's also...
*  Is that something you wear?
*  Well, look, no cock either.
*  Do you know there's people that are doing that?
*  They're just getting castrated because people want to be nulls.
*  They want to be nothing.
*  Is that a real thing?
*  Oh, yeah, it's a real thing.
*  But isn't that essentially what someone gets the surgery is doing?
*  Well, they're trying to get a hole.
*  Yeah, they want to piss you.
*  This is just like they become like the Unsullied from...
*  Exactly. They want no cock, no balls, no nothing.
*  How do you pee?
*  Let's go champ.
*  You don't have to pee. What are the rules?
*  Piss out a little piss hole.
*  Just keep a little fucking bandaid over it for most of the day.
*  I don't know.
*  Have a little cork you put in it.
*  But I don't want you to do that.
*  But if you're an American,
*  I feel like you should have the freedom to do something stupid.
*  You know, I'm covered in tattoos.
*  You want to get your dick chopped off?
*  Who the fuck am I to tell you?
*  You're never going to hear a thing where someone goes,
*  you cut your dick off?
*  Best thing I ever did.
*  Probably not.
*  But some people just don't want to be around.
*  Well, there was that like pain Olympics thing back in the day
*  where the guys would mutilate their cocks and you're like,
*  I mean, you only got one shot to slice your dick.
*  I saw plenty of those videos where guys just chop the head of their dicks
*  off with knives.
*  It's insane.
*  It's like you get it.
*  I mean, how good is that orgasm?
*  You get it one time.
*  I don't even think they're orgasm.
*  They're soft.
*  They're not sliced into a hard dick.
*  They bleed out.
*  How good is that?
*  Just spray.
*  Just fucking spray.
*  All right, Joe, stop bringing science to the dumb conversation we're having.
*  Can you imagine what a terrible time to get your dick chopped off?
*  How good is the choking?
*  They have sex and then they're down.
*  Peyronie's disease.
*  Enthusiastic young lady might get a little bobbly on the top
*  and let it slip a little and a taint slam you.
*  How can they not tell?
*  Like Anderson Silva's shin.
*  How can these ladies not tell that they're at the end of the dick
*  when they're jumping up so high?
*  They're having a good time, Jay.
*  They're having a good time.
*  But you know we're walking.
*  I know. I know.
*  We're on the tightrope.
*  We're walking that tightrope.
*  The come ups are coming up too high on her.
*  You're like, hang on.
*  I've had it happen a few times where a bad...
*  But I mean, obviously nothing.
*  No real injury.
*  She might have been with that Hile Hitler dude before you.
*  She's used to a little bit of travel in her suspension.
*  She's like, no, we got plenty of time.
*  She wants that raptor type travel.
*  Boom, boom.
*  She wants some fucking...
*  Some lift.
*  You should have that thing like on the back of your car
*  where it's like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
*  You guys, we're getting close.
*  We're getting close here.
*  Just have some sort of a strapping system, you know,
*  where you're like you're spotting her.
*  Cinch her down.
*  OK, we've got this much travel.
*  That's it.
*  Don't get crazy.
*  So if we're going to agree to this, you savage,
*  trying to break my dick.
*  I wish my...
*  What a terrible way to break your dick too.
*  I wish my dick was big enough to break.
*  There's a girl out there right now and go, I could break it.
*  I'll break the cock.
*  I'll break that cock.
*  Right in half.
*  Break that fucking angry little dick.
*  Guys, while we have a look,
*  I talked to you about my new propulsion system.
*  Day!
*  Jamie, the PowerPoint presentation, please.
*  It is so funny coming into this room
*  and thinking about the things I've watched that are made such like,
*  whether it be the Cat Williams thing or fucking...
*  I mean, that was wild.
*  The one I just said, Terrence Howard.
*  Oh, yeah, Terrence Howard one's very interesting.
*  He's a very, very smart guy.
*  He just doesn't have a formal education and stuff.
*  So like when I had Brett Weinstein on the...
*  Excuse me, Eric Weinstein on the podcast,
*  Eric sort of explained to him the things he's getting wrong
*  and explained to him, you got to stop teaching.
*  You got to stop saying you're teaching people.
*  This is very offensive to people like myself.
*  He's like an actual super genius.
*  And he's like...
*  But they were talking about like crazy equations.
*  And he was explaining the equations to him.
*  And he's like, do you understand how to read this?
*  It's like having him go over the equations.
*  So it was very interesting.
*  So Terrence is like this super smart guy.
*  It's way smarter than anybody around him.
*  But then the really super smart guys
*  or actually super smart guys are educated about it.
*  They don't engage with them.
*  And so Eric was like, let me just talk to this dude.
*  I think he's one of us.
*  He's just gone astray.
*  Just a brilliant guy who hasn't actually got in the correct education.
*  Well, I like when he was doing...
*  He goes, well, then, Joe, you have to understand because the
*  fontugellies, there was words that I don't think were things.
*  Maybe they were.
*  I think some of them were things, but others, they're things that he invented.
*  Like, you know, whatever you want.
*  Yeah.
*  What is the the the invention of the flying?
*  What does he call them again?
*  When all those little components move together and it creates like
*  he's got this car, why is it the tip of my tongue?
*  Lynch pin.
*  So this thing that he created, it's like these
*  they're like geometric shapes and they fit into each other.
*  And each one of them has a fan in the circle of it.
*  And through this thing as a drone, it can move like in any direction.
*  It's very bizarre.
*  And Weinstein was looking at it like this is a very legit invention.
*  Well, you came up with this crazy.
*  But see, you see, we can find the videos of it.
*  And so it's it's also you could add more to it.
*  It's not like one single shape.
*  So they connect into each other and you can keep adding more and more to it
*  and give it more power and more maneuverability.
*  The utility for it is drones.
*  It's like you could you could have a drone that moves concrete bars.
*  I mean, concrete blocks.
*  You could you could have a drone that moves railroad ties
*  and it could fly him through the air.
*  It's scalable.
*  So this is the small version of it in operation.
*  And it's all all those things that you see, those little geometric patterns.
*  There are individuals, individuals, and you can keep piling them
*  on top of that and connect it and you can make them larger and smaller.
*  It's a it's a fascinating idea.
*  And this is the dude who is an Iron Man.
*  Hustle and flow.
*  Just like in spare time, he just came up with this.
*  And he's got like some crazy amount of patents, man.
*  The dude has like what is it?
*  Ninety something patents he has something crazy.
*  But this is all like his invention and no formal education.
*  Very not to the level of like an
*  Eric Weinstein, which is really all these people that are actually working on stuff.
*  Generally, they have, you know, depending upon what the discipline is,
*  they have a long education in traditional universities.
*  And he's kind of like a self-taught genius.
*  Nah, no, he's crazy smart.
*  He's just he's just not like he's going to hang out with more people like him.
*  I mean, it's too smart for anybody.
*  He knows this is right.
*  This is what he needs more.
*  Eric Weinstein, Dave Smith, a few years ago.
*  That's true.
*  Same thing.
*  Well, I was on the episode after the first time you had him on.
*  And the episode with him was just insane.
*  I mean, it was like the biggest thing on the Internet.
*  And almost 100 percent of the comments on my episode, the next one, were
*  we want more Terrence Howard.
*  Enough of this.
*  Dave, where's your dog?
*  It's fun, man.
*  He's fun.
*  It's fun.
*  Can you invent an Uber to get into and get the fuck out of here?
*  I did.
*  It doesn't go to the right address, but I did invent an Uber.
*  Yeah, it's some it's fun.
*  Those things are fun.
*  Yeah, it's fun to hear people like come up with these wacky theories.
*  And is that like his?
*  But he has some great ideas, man.
*  And one of them is the idea that all the planets are coming from
*  like stuff that's jettisoned off the sun.
*  Like his theory about the creation of solar systems is very bizarre.
*  And it's really interesting.
*  He thinks that a planet gets to a certain distance
*  after a certain amount of time from the sun where it can develop life.
*  And then that life evolves as quickly as it can,
*  because it's going to eventually over the next 100 million, 200 million years,
*  it's going to be further and further and further out the space.
*  And it's not going to be habitable anymore.
*  So you're going to have to figure out a way to make your own environment
*  or you're going to perish.
*  And every planet goes through a transitionary period.
*  It's called peopling.
*  When a planet gets to a certain distance, these hominids start
*  figuring out things and figuring out tools and engines and civilization
*  and agriculture and then electronics.
*  And then they have to get to a point where they realize like
*  this planet keeps moving away from the sun.
*  We are fucked.
*  We have to figure out artificial environments.
*  We have to figure out interstellar travel.
*  We have to figure out how to fucking planet populate other worlds.
*  That's where we're at right now.
*  We're we're like a hundred thousand years away from it being a problem.
*  Brought to us by Terrence Fucking Howard.
*  Yeah. But his theory about planets is fascinating because nobody really knows
*  why planets are formed, how the you know, there's a distance from the sun.
*  And you can figure there's a thing called Bode's Law.
*  We can figure out roughly by the size of one planet
*  when another planet is going to exist.
*  And that's where they look.
*  His voice is too cool to be a nerd.
*  That's why I think the problem, the disconnect I have is he's like, come on, Joe.
*  It's simple to cool to answer nitrogen makes everything.
*  Well, he does that thing where especially because most of us
*  aren't people who even think about this stuff.
*  So then when he's saying it, like when he was saying the whole thing,
*  when he was on with you about how the periodic table shouldn't be squares,
*  it should be circle. And he had like a really good argument for it.
*  And I remember just being like, that does sound really impressive.
*  Why is that agree with him?
*  Well, that's what the thing is.
*  Then, like when you see someone like Eric Weinstein go like, oh, yeah,
*  he's got a good point about this.
*  You're like, wait, seriously? Yeah.
*  Now in it. All right.
*  He's the greatest genius man. Terrence Howard is fucking genius.
*  He's just sometimes guys are too smart for everybody around them.
*  And they just get off on the wrong track.
*  Yeah. And if you're used to being the smartest guy in the room
*  and then all of a sudden you're talking to a guy who's like spooky smart,
*  it's you know, it's a little unsettling.
*  It's like, you know, a guy who tells you he's a comic, you know,
*  he's telling everybody he's a comic.
*  Hey, Mike is a comic.
*  Mike works down the and then you meet Mike and you're like,
*  how long have you been doing comedy?
*  Well, I've done a couple of Mike Nights and like, oh, OK, OK.
*  You're not really a comic, right? Right.
*  You're not making a living like you're not an actor.
*  You're not getting paid.
*  Well, I don't have any money for Terrence Howard and his projects.
*  I gave it all to Eddie Winslow from Family Matters
*  to clean up the ocean machine he's building.
*  Hmm. There is a kid that's cleaning up the ocean.
*  What's that kid's name? Boyan Slot.
*  You ever seen that machine? His name is Boyant. Boyan.
*  I was like, that's funny.
*  That's still on the news.
*  His name is Waverunner Johnson.
*  I never even thought of that.
*  That's hilarious. I've even had him on the show.
*  Boyan Slot. He was like 19 when he invented this.
*  He invented this gigantic skimmer
*  that's been scooping stuff off the ocean.
*  And then they turn the plastic into like sunglasses and shit,
*  which will eventually find their way back in the ocean.
*  Sure. That's after a little bit.
*  They make they make stuff which is by the way, the landfills.
*  That's really great.
*  Dude, 19 super fucking smart, like spooky, smart kid just said,
*  this is what I want to dedicate my life to.
*  So you get a video of how they do it. It's pretty wild.
*  But they've already cleaned up a significant amount.
*  And they have this proposal to make and scale the thing up
*  and make it huge.
*  And they think they can clean up the whole garbage patch
*  within the next decade or so.
*  It's incredible. It's not.
*  But it's not that the fucking thing existed in plastics
*  only been around for like how long?
*  A hundred years. Yeah.
*  And we already have a Texas sized chunk of it
*  sitting in the middle of the fucking ocean.
*  People are great.
*  The people are the best.
*  I know people also make things that young and get this kind of thing.
*  I think they're late later in life.
*  Last shadows when it ends up being crazy.
*  Oh, yeah. It's going to be all.
*  Because they gave up all their funds.
*  And then it gets too wild afterwards.
*  Right. He's going to get all that eco pussy, too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Once you shave those bitches down, there's usually something hot under there.
*  It's usually the kind of gals that are willing to throw paint on statues
*  and glue themselves to the floor.
*  You know, no more oil.
*  So this just all sitting in the ocean.
*  Yeah. So he scoops all this stuff out with each run of this.
*  And this is just, you know, one haul.
*  And they just continue to do this.
*  And then they crane it and pack it and turn it into different objects and stuff.
*  And you can buy that stuff.
*  That's fine. It's a good thing.
*  I mean, those situations that goes great.
*  And he becomes like a coke head partier a little bit later.
*  Or he's you know, he dies like a whale ate him like while he was helping
*  clean up the thing.
*  I was watching this thing on Singapore and how well Singapore recycles.
*  It's incredible.
*  Singapore takes all of their garbage.
*  They pick it up like multiple times.
*  They have this insane facility where they sort it out.
*  They find out what's plastic. What's this? What's that?
*  They they use the plastic and they figure out some way to use it
*  to to to make power, generate power by burning it.
*  And they have this insane filtration system that stops it from polluting the air.
*  And then they take it and they grind a lot of this stuff down
*  and they use it to make roads with it and they recycle everything.
*  Isn't that isn't our recycling bullshit?
*  I remember reading about this ago that our recycling is all every time
*  I put stuff into my recycling, it makes me so angry because I read
*  like 10 percent of it gets actually recycled.
*  Yeah, we thought we were good people. We're just getting scammed.
*  It's getting scammed to buy a fucking blue dumpster.
*  What is the point of it, though? What is the whole scam?
*  I don't understand why.
*  It's too expensive to convert.
*  There was one poor guy sitting on a bunch of blue garbage cans.
*  See if you can find something on how Singapore does it.
*  I know I saved it. If you want me to find it.
*  You're saying they do a good job. Incredible.
*  They fucking recycle everything.
*  They they have like this insanely efficient way of taking the plastic
*  and reutilizing it and using it to like fill streets and pave roads
*  and build things. And they're using all of it.
*  Whereas we're just fucking sticking it in the ground.
*  Yeah, somebody else will figure it out.
*  Covered it up with dirt.
*  Singapore looks like it's made of Legos.
*  It's just plastic everywhere.
*  It's pretty nuts, man. No, it's pretty.
*  They also polluted the ocean with that plane.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Yeah, human beings are fucking weird.
*  We are weird.
*  Do you remember how much you used to litter back in the day in the 90s?
*  Dude, I would fucking any time I had like a Coca Cola cup,
*  I just throw it right out the window.
*  I don't give a shit.
*  Full bag full bag of trash on the highway side.
*  So it used to be a big problem.
*  So they used to have a big trash problem, apparently.
*  And that's what led them to this insane, like super efficient
*  version of recycling and super thorough.
*  Pretty interesting shit.
*  Waste generated. Oh, we're we're making a lot of waste.
*  Yeah, we make plenty of waste, son.
*  That's what America does, motherfucker.
*  If you don't like it, you can move to China.
*  Yeah, we must. We must get in the world.
*  Shit. Yeah.
*  So they take it and they burn it.
*  And that burning it is what powers electricity.
*  It's like it's really insanely efficient.
*  And then again, they use it for all kinds of stuff.
*  But the point is, they utilize all the trash.
*  And that's what we're supposed to be doing.
*  But there's a bunch of knuckleheads, the same knuckleheads
*  that are in charge of the homeless and the homelessness just keeps growing.
*  And they need more.
*  We need more funds to deal with this issue that we can't deal with.
*  It's the same fucking thing.
*  If we if you had private companies that were incentivized
*  to collect all the plastic and that they could take that plastic
*  and use it for all kinds of things.
*  And that's right. Yeah.
*  All you got to do is set up the incentives and human beings figure it out.
*  All you got to do is go, if you solve this problem, you can become a billionaire.
*  And then some genius will figure it out to become a billionaire.
*  Isn't that interesting?
*  We're not willing to give the private sector access to garbage so much,
*  so much that will let them pretend they're recycling and just
*  stick stuff in the ground.
*  Because it's not cost effective to turn it into things.
*  Can sanitation be one of the last mafia run businesses?
*  Well, it's run by a section of the government, right?
*  But it's like if you were competing against Singapore, you would lose.
*  OK, if like one city was run by Singapore, like Chicago was run by Singapore,
*  but Detroit was run by people who do it right now.
*  And you had to figure out which which way is better for the city,
*  which way looks better, which way is more efficient,
*  which way actually like creates less overall waste
*  because you just recycle it and reuse it.
*  And it actually works as an asset and a commodity.
*  Wouldn't that be better?
*  Like if somebody could do it, you could do it.
*  But the problem is there's no fucking incentive.
*  There's probably so much infrastructure within all of these.
*  Like it's just been how many years that we've been having this system of
*  of sanitation that it's like to try to change that in any sort of like abrupt
*  way is like insane. What do you even do?
*  I remember there was a landfill near my house.
*  We would go like we would like ride our bikes down to the train tracks
*  and find the landfill.
*  And it was just piles and piles and piles of garbage.
*  It's basically the modern version of what it was like to live in a city
*  with horses shit in the streets.
*  Yeah, it's like a mild version of it.
*  Well, it wasn't like much thought put into like the down the road times.
*  Now it's just weird.
*  Not only that, it gets into the water, you know, and you just dump
*  a bunch of shit on the ground like that.
*  You know, you're allowed to have a place.
*  We just fill it in.
*  What about the water that's running under that?
*  Like what happens there?
*  Liquid death. Yeah.
*  Metal water comes with that water.
*  Yeah, there's like so much fucked up in how we do things and not course
*  correcting. But I mean, is it so with the recycling thing, is it just designed
*  to fine us for not recycling and create more revenue?
*  I think initially they have this idea that that's what they were going to do,
*  that they were going to recycle things and they do recycle bottles
*  and they do recycle cans because it's cost effective.
*  The problem with plastic, it's not cost effective to recycle.
*  So 90 percent of it or something in the range of that gets thrown in the ground.
*  They just put it in the dirt, which is the fucking worst.
*  Like, why are you making me separate garbage?
*  If you just can I just put plastic, we just admit and I'll just put plastic
*  bottles in the garbage now because that's what I've been doing.
*  I kind of gave up. I gave up on your little bullshit charade.
*  I'm not going to be a part of this if I know you're not doing it.
*  Well, there is I see that there's like a rule follow for a while.
*  The people are so funny.
*  I just kind of see the results, but I don't know what the actual fight is.
*  Like sometimes in New York, there's plastic bags everywhere.
*  And then one time they'll tell you, goes, no, they're completely illegal now.
*  Plus, and then the.
*  Oh, yeah. There is paper bags.
*  If you want to kill the trees in New York.
*  Well, during the pandemic, they kind of because it was they made that law
*  maybe six months before the pandemic.
*  And they were like, no more plastic bags, only paper.
*  And then the pandemic hit and they were like, all right,
*  we need to figure out priorities here.
*  And then they started using plastic bags again.
*  But in New Jersey, you have to when I go to shop, right,
*  I have to pay for new reusable bags every time they no longer give even paper.
*  Now, I got a lot of those that are going to recycle.
*  They're good for lighting fires, the paper ones.
*  Want to start a little fire on fire?
*  Yes. Crumple up some paper bags.
*  Sticking under there.
*  It is like at the airport, they'll do that with the big paper bags
*  and they charge you for the for the paper bags.
*  It's like like bags were always free.
*  Do you know I existed for 30 years on this planet of bags.
*  I think it just makes you think about it like every time.
*  Well, one out of every 100 people remember to bring their own shopping bags.
*  What type of fucking nerd shopping bags shopping bags?
*  Paper bags are good, man.
*  But the trees I see that my girlfriend
*  replies to the store when she's been like, oh, let's go.
*  And I'm all wait. I'm going to run back to the apartment.
*  I forgot to get the bags.
*  We're going to buy new. I'm not
*  going to buy new bags.
*  You know what the biggest scam going is?
*  The paper bag industry, because they should all be hemp paper bags.
*  If they were all hemp paper bags, they would be a hundred times better.
*  They'd be so much stronger.
*  You wouldn't have to chop down a tree to do it.
*  You chop down a stalk of a plant that doesn't even make weed.
*  You know, they have them where they don't.
*  There's no THC in them at all.
*  And you make gigantic fucking
*  chunks of this paper that's almost indestructible.
*  It's so different. You can barely tear it.
*  Is it cheaper? No. Sure.
*  It would be cheaper if you had the infrastructure because you could read.
*  Like you see, if you have an acre of trees and you chop them down,
*  it's going to be fucking years before you can chop down the new ones
*  that you plant afterwards.
*  It takes forever for them to grow.
*  But hemp, you can redo it every fucking few months.
*  That shit grows like a weed.
*  Wasn't a big part of why like weed was made illegal
*  because they didn't want the competition from hemp or something like that.
*  100 percent. 100 percent.
*  It was William Randolph Hearst. Right.
*  He was the Reef of Madness guy, along with Harry Anslinger.
*  They demonize it as a commodity.
*  If we if we had like true freedom in terms of like use the best plants
*  to do stuff, that would be one of the number one.
*  Forget about the weed argument.
*  The number one thing is hemp. It's so much better paper.
*  It's all it's it's like it's really strong, like in a weird way.
*  I'll give you a piece of hemp paper. Like, what the fuck, man?
*  But hemp's legal now, right?
*  Everywhere. Just paper clothing.
*  It was it's been suppressed for so fucking long
*  that the infrastructure is not really available to compete with like regular paper
*  or to compete with. I mean, they're making hemp clothes.
*  It's sort of an oddity.
*  That was always like a heavy thing.
*  Like if you could find like even Woody Harrelson,
*  Woody Harrelson was real big on hemp for a long time.
*  It's way better.
*  There's a company called Datsusara. They make hemp geese.
*  They're the best geese, man. They don't rip cotton geese.
*  They rip all these hemp geese are like indestructible.
*  The only thing that gives out on them is this. The threads give out.
*  I feel like you don't want to get caught in a hemp geechoke.
*  I'd much rather just like a regular geese than a hemp geese.
*  Like, dude, I forgot to tell you the only geese that rip are old ones, man.
*  You know, regular, regular geese will fuck you up.
*  I read a thing about a spider silk earlier today.
*  As we're talking about, like materials,
*  apparently spider silk is like one of the most strong, like if they actually they
*  they make actual clothing and like garments out of it.
*  And it's like, I believe that because you get caught in one of one string of it.
*  And it's like on you for five minutes. You can't get it off.
*  You imagine that was as thick as like a power line.
*  It's one fifth as thick as a human hair or one tenth as thick as a human hair.
*  And they there was a team of guys who spent five years like,
*  I don't know, milking spiders, but they were using
*  they were getting the silk out of these spiders.
*  And they made this like big fucking gown with it.
*  And it was, I don't know, one of you know, there's a thing they're trying to do.
*  OK, they're saying the human side silk is used to make bulletproof clothing.
*  There's a thing they're trying to do now, though, where they're trying to make
*  human skin and you know how they can kind of splice genetics together.
*  They want to make human skin that is made with this gene for this spider silk.
*  So see if you can find that.
*  So what they're trying to do, you end up in a superhero movie, man.
*  They're literally developed to remember human spider.
*  I mean, this right now, it's theoretical.
*  But if you think about what they're going to be able to do medically
*  just in the next decade or two, especially with the AI stuff,
*  that's a scary shit, scary shit.
*  As soon as they start integrating humans with that stuff,
*  they're going to come up with all sorts of solutions to all sorts of problems.
*  And one of them is going to be non bulletproof skin.
*  Stopping crime.
*  We're going to just like make everybody mandatory, just like you get vaccinated.
*  Everybody's going to have to get bulletproof skin.
*  So we don't have to worry about gun violence anymore.
*  It doesn't work anymore.
*  We're just shooting each other in the head like Wolverine.
*  We're going to evolve through technology.
*  We can't afford bulletproof skin.
*  We're going to all look like turtles.
*  We're all ready to go, Joe.
*  Ninja turtles in the future.
*  We're all going to be like covered with armor.
*  And it'll be just wild kingdom out there in the streets.
*  Every day is a fucking street takeover.
*  Philadelphia, yeah.
*  Philadelphia Street Takeover.
*  Maybe that's how we get out of this.
*  You know, like humans had to figure out opposable thumbs to be able to throw spears.
*  Maybe we maybe at one point in time, we have to just grow armor.
*  We're not going to fix this problem of violence.
*  It would be pretty bad ass.
*  Yeah, just have you, especially if you're the first human with it.
*  Like if you get to be the first one who's got armor.
*  I'm like, for real, how the fuck did a turtle become a turtle?
*  How long did that take?
*  And what the fuck was going on?
*  I think it was a rat found him in the sewers.
*  Let's see. I won him at a carnival.
*  But think of all the animals that are so vulnerable.
*  And this one motherfucker goes, you know, I got an idea.
*  And somehow or another, over the course of who knows how many fucking million years,
*  it becomes a goddamn turtle.
*  And it's such a good design that has changed.
*  And for us of like alligators and crocodiles just fucking smashing through turtles,
*  just like like a cookie saltwater crocs,
*  just crushing them up like they're nothing.
*  Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, it's so disgusting.
*  It's brutal. See if you can find a video.
*  I've checked to the bulletproof skin was a story from 2012.
*  Yeah, it was a project with an artist.
*  I don't know that they were actually ever trying to do that.
*  That's a fucking CIA cover. I couldn't find it.
*  I couldn't find anything to work with.
*  They're going to cover Jason Bourne with bulletproof skin first.
*  And they're going to say, Jesus Christ, that's Jason Bourne with bulletproof skin.
*  And it's great for this project.
*  Oh, Genghis Khan wanted it. Of course he wanted it.
*  This legendary emperor said to have issued his horsemen with silk vests
*  as an arrow hitting silk does not break it,
*  but ends up embedded in the flesh wrapped in silk. Interesting. Wow.
*  So the silk was so strong
*  that the arrows would just go into your skin through this and you wouldn't get hit.
*  It's like a Kevlar.
*  So you you would you'd still get fucked up,
*  but you wouldn't get full penetration. It wouldn't penetrate.
*  Wow.
*  But silk.
*  That's why you're so sure and shoot you with an arrow.
*  Those arrows sucked.
*  Those broadheads sucked.
*  Joe Rogan could fucking shoot somebody with a silk shirt on.
*  You could not do that today. Yeah, there's a different.
*  I don't know what kind of silk they had, but a modern day broadhead.
*  Those things are horrifying.
*  Well, I don't understand it, but it can't just be like a silk t-shirt.
*  They had to have some type of thick silk even for arrows back then.
*  Yeah, it must have been really thick because they were powerful bows, too,
*  especially the Mongols.
*  The Mongols had these insane bows that took like 160 pounds to draw back.
*  And they were famous for like when they looked at their skeletons, their bones,
*  the one side of their body was like deformed because they were pulling
*  like with the right arm their whole life, right?
*  The whole spine and everything is they have like giant bones
*  in their shoulders and arms like their whole body developed
*  to pull this fucking insane bow back.
*  So that kind of a bow has crazy power behind it with this bullshit
*  homemade arrow and these fucking whatever kind of heads they were using.
*  That would suck to put all that effort into pulling the bow
*  and then silk takes it out.
*  I mean, I did that for nothing.
*  I got beat by silk.
*  I wonder if it would work with their bows.
*  I wonder if that was just for the enemy's bows, because the Mongols were
*  they were so advanced militarily, which is really bizarre.
*  It is like one dude's group who likes to live in tents
*  decide to literally take over the fucking world and would have done it.
*  Got pretty close. Yeah.
*  They killed 10 percent of the people on the fucking planet during his lifetime.
*  All people like that always have weird facial hair.
*  There is, however, little historical basis to this.
*  What is it? The silk shirt claim? Oh, OK.
*  You'd like to hear the claims of the Mongols.
*  Bring it up. This is bullshit.
*  Jamie, can you stop making us look like assholes at every chance?
*  Pretty other thing that tells me I was wrong from front to back.
*  There is, however, little historical basis.
*  No primary source can be found containing the statement.
*  The earliest mention of it in relation to the Mongols comes from Michael
*  Pradens, 1934, to Shingis Khan, their storm house, I said, Proudin.
*  Did I get that right?
*  Eager to give Mongols every technological edge over their foes
*  appears to have assumed the Mongols as a warrior race
*  would only have worn silk for military purposes.
*  And but is there any historical depictions of silk stopping arrows?
*  So if you could find that when I was maybe the Mongols didn't do it,
*  maybe it was like a theory.
*  The AI from Google says that they were silk underclosed
*  to help prevent blood loss from arrows and that they had armor
*  that was sewn together with silk.
*  But there was no sort of plates that makes much more sense.
*  So it's like, yeah, under the arm of a kiss by God, just like the samurai outfits.
*  They have this place, right?
*  They have the mesh under the plate so they can move around.
*  We have one of those samurai outfits out there.
*  It's a real one from the 1800s. Really? It's freaky.
*  Freaky to think these do have to use this time machine to go get it.
*  By the took a long time on it actually got for me as a gift.
*  Ticksle, you have to it's like a pain in the ass to get it over here.
*  I'd imagine that's a tough thing to buy. Yeah.
*  It's a weird thing. Museum.
*  We talked about doing so they do these like medieval fights like it's almost like
*  MMA and like medieval gear. Yeah.
*  And we talked about doing it at Skankfest, but to ship the armor
*  to Vegas from wherever they were, it would be so expensive.
*  We'd have to it would be it would make more sense to drive it out in a van.
*  Just like the team of people.
*  You've seen those Russian videos where those guys beat the fuck out of each other.
*  Yeah, it is. Yeah.
*  Do don't do that.
*  I can't believe I have to tell you don't do that.
*  Please don't do that.
*  Yeah. And I got a sword.
*  Bro, you're going to get hit in the head with a sword.
*  You're going to forget all your jokes.
*  No, it's all right.
*  I got a sword.
*  I got a bad joke about your sword ways.
*  No, I got him. I got him a spider silk hat. He's fine.
*  Even if you have that helmet on, imagine how much a fucking sword
*  ways and it's hit you in the arm or is like 120 pounds, 130 pounds.
*  How much would you need around your head to let someone hit you in the head with a sword?
*  I mean, a lot more than that.
*  Yeah, more than that. A lot more than that would be fun, though.
*  Bro, you get a shield to the head.
*  You're getting CT motherfucking E.
*  You can pretend that you're protected.
*  You are not protected from that.
*  I don't know.
*  Lewis Lewis, do you still remember your jokes?
*  The dance in that guy's helmet
*  where he's got hit in the head with a fucking sword and one medieval.
*  Fucking rule.
*  And they're doing it live for what I would describe as not that many people.
*  Yeah, 45 people.
*  I know. But if I went to this, I would go home and I go,
*  I can't believe there's only 45 people.
*  This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.
*  A giant turkey leg in a giant goblet.
*  Gosh, they got everything.
*  Renaissance fair.
*  They got the dark game where you can win the animal.
*  I'm going back. Look at this.
*  He's on top of the ground.
*  Beating him with his shield. Oh, my God.
*  This is a weapon. He's beating him with his weapon.
*  That night insane that night had really good top control.
*  Bro, this guy got fucked up.
*  That are you OK?
*  Ye. That kind of weight dropping down on your head with that big ass fucking shield.
*  And look, this virgin is going to take his helmet off.
*  Hello. Hi, guys. Thank you, everybody.
*  You also have to take into account performing for you.
*  You got to take into account the weight of all that armor on his arm
*  and how much more that's driving down the impact of it. Right. Right.
*  Just coming down.
*  Yeah. All that weight because it's all covered in steel.
*  And then he has this big ass fucking shield and steel gloves on.
*  And he's coming down in your head with that over and over and over again.
*  You think that's a terrible idea?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man.
*  That guy got Mike got a real fucked up, like a different kind of like a crack
*  skull type fucked up. They fed him to a dragon afterwards.
*  I mean, that could drag.
*  That seems like that could kill somebody like that.
*  That doesn't seem like even with armor on.
*  I don't believe that you can be OK from getting hit like that in the head.
*  Well, also, all the shit from like from the NFL is like
*  like the helmet doesn't really matter because if you're when it's
*  cracking against your head and you're rattling around, how good could that
*  helmet be where you would let a dude with a shield and an iron
*  fucking sleeve on slam down on your head over and over and over again?
*  That could crack your skull.
*  I completely agree with you at the same box with an MMA person.
*  Yeah, dude. Well, that's there's no way that's I would do that over
*  powerslap any day of the week. Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, my God. Look at these guys have fucking access.
*  And this one, this is what I want to do.
*  So insane. This is so fucking.
*  Lewis, let's me and you fight again with spears.
*  Let's go. Here's the thing.
*  I got to run to the bathroom.
*  Don't don't do this. You two.
*  And I do want to watch a full pay per view of this now.
*  It does look great. This does rule.
*  Here's the thing. If you allow these guys to have no armor, dudes sign up.
*  If you decided you're going to have a full sword fight version
*  of this with no armor, guys would show up with a fucking bikini on
*  ready to slice you up.
*  If we decided one day if some crazy country, some fucking warlord
*  dictator type dude decided to have actual sword fights with no armor on,
*  dudes would do it.
*  There's there's enough psychotic men out there.
*  They'll just jump into something.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Back in the day, there was we used to watch felony fights, dude.
*  Oh, yeah. And those guys would have they would give the two guys nunchucks.
*  They'd just beat the shit out of each other on a parking lot.
*  And just two fucking Mexican guys wailing on each other.
*  I remember this Mexican people fuck this white dude up.
*  And he was a good boxer and he cracked him and knocked him out.
*  And then when he got him on the ground, he kept dropping knees on his unconscious.
*  Oh, and he was like, you know, that one was breathing like crazy.
*  It was really horrible.
*  It was horrible.
*  Like, yeah, the sound like seizing up and shit.
*  I was listening to Howard Stern the other day.
*  It was an old one where they were talking.
*  The people that were good old days, the people that were trying to get on
*  like that the one way trip to Mars, they were going to try to do it.
*  What was from the years of 2012?
*  And they said it wasn't going to go until 2020, so much.
*  I don't think it ever ended up happening.
*  But like like there was they said it was thousands of people
*  were trying to get on that mission.
*  One way trip to die on Mars. Yeah.
*  Thousands. Oh, yeah.
*  I said it had to be whittled down by the way, being whittled down to like 16.
*  It was not a lot of people, but they were like, oh, yeah, you had to go through.
*  And it's like how many doctors and all.
*  It's pretty crazy how much people are willing to do some nutty people, bro.
*  There's a lot of people out there that want to end it.
*  They say they want to know.
*  They said for sure you they said for sure.
*  But they said odds are you definitely will never make it to Mars.
*  And if you get there, it's like it's everything just kind of like
*  you're probably going to die in route.
*  It takes you're always going to have people that want to sign up for that kind of stuff.
*  You just put like whatever the thing is.
*  There's like remember back in the day, it was a big thing in New York in the 90s.
*  There were bug chasers.
*  It was like a sect of the gay community that was trying to get AIDS.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
*  There's a there's a great series on Netflix right now called The Terror.
*  And it's about these guys that try to cross the ice paths
*  in like the 1800s and they know they never make it.
*  Spoiler alert.
*  It gets fucking dark, dude.
*  It gets dark.
*  These dudes just got stranded on a boat with other guys.
*  And of course, they started eating each other.
*  The real story, it's based on a real story.
*  These gentlemen actually did do this and they didn't find their body.
*  They didn't find anything until like years and years later.
*  They went and they found clear evidence of like people getting cut up.
*  What was the time period?
*  Eighteen hundreds.
*  They just thought they were slick and they're going to make it across.
*  And it was a particularly cold winter.
*  And the the ice never thawed in that area.
*  And they just got stuck there.
*  They just got stuck.
*  And then the ice developed all around them.
*  And they were there for years.
*  I mean, that like that's like a thing of survival, which I understand.
*  But you see people that go to like, what's the big fish concert?
*  There was no stacks.
*  What's the mountain?
*  They're like the tallest one, the hardest one ever.
*  And yeah, you see those videos of like the bodies that are like
*  the bodies are now markers, like you get to a certain
*  that it's the name of a guy like Jim.
*  It's like that's Jim.
*  He is when you're at however many feet high.
*  Yeah. And there's no way to get their bodies back down.
*  So they just are frozen.
*  You have to leave them there.
*  No one no.
*  No one can retrieve them and stay alive.
*  It's too dangerous.
*  That's wild. It's fucking nuts, man.
*  You could find like one of the first guys that ever died up there.
*  They is like it's all white.
*  It looks like a statue.
*  And he's face down, face down on the rock frozen.
*  And they don't touch the see if you can find the image.
*  The images. I mean, somebody must haunting because there's one person
*  who can climb it, who can like, no, no, I'm saying one person
*  that can climb it, they can like that's done like something shitty
*  to the stuff up there.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably.
*  You guys kick the head off.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, when you were kids, you take like the reindeer on people's lawns
*  and put them in different positions.
*  Look at this.
*  These guys, this guy's dead.
*  But there's one way that one in the lower left hand corner, Jamie,
*  lower left hand guard, that one.
*  That's the one.
*  Look at that.
*  Well, bro, imagine walking past that and go, yeah, that guy's a pussy.
*  I'm going to fucking make it up there.
*  And I'm going to come back down.
*  I'm going to jerk off on his back.
*  That's a skin.
*  With a fucking Chicago Bulls hat on.
*  So he's completely frozen.
*  Yeah, he's frozen.
*  He's dead forever.
*  He's been dead for a long time.
*  Look, that guy's got old ass clothes on that have been just slowly worn away by time.
*  Yeah, it's amazing.
*  Because his regular picture from the 70s.
*  But this is what happens.
*  Like people die, like you'll be in a group and somebody dies and you go, well, guys,
*  we have to leave him.
*  And you're like, you're like, what?
*  That's my cousin.
*  You have to leave them while they're dying.
*  Yeah. You could die.
*  Yeah. Like you can't help them.
*  You have to just go.
*  And they're just going to die a slow death.
*  Look at these guys get trapped.
*  I can't believe how many people agree to like do like death sentences.
*  But like then there's something like the submersible thing that was just like
*  everyone was like cheers and champagne like this, the best.
*  And then it just ends immediately.
*  Oh, they saved that guy.
*  Look, he got trapped.
*  Oh, my God. Imagine getting trapped like that.
*  And that's it. You just slowly die.
*  Wishing you could just get shot in the head and not have to slowly die.
*  That's so insane. It's all so insane.
*  And it's just to get to the top.
*  So you got there.
*  I mean, is it how exhilarating it has to be?
*  So I bet it's not that great.
*  Well, it's probably you realize you could do something very difficult,
*  which a lot of people have a desire to do.
*  And it's also bragging right for a lot of dickheads.
*  There's a lot of dickheads.
*  I want to tell you, I've been in Nepal.
*  I went up to Everest.
*  I really helped the community.
*  You know, there's a lot of people that just do it for street.
*  More acoustic guitar song up there.
*  It's pretty gay.
*  Some people, they just want to fucking challenge themselves, though,
*  in some insane way where they might die.
*  I think it's when you don't have kids.
*  All any of those things like skydiving, all I never I was one of the skydive
*  and I'm terrified of heights.
*  But as soon as I had a kid, I was like, I'm not not the same plane.
*  I'm the same. Yeah. Unnecessary risk.
*  And I said, now is my daughter's older, too, like having that thing where it's like
*  now she'd have to be like, what happened to your dad?
*  Like motorbike didn't open.
*  Yeah, exactly. Motorcycle.
*  I think he turned it was raining and he turned on his motorcycle a little too fast.
*  Oh, I was going to get a motorcycle license.
*  I was sitting in traffic and I was just watching cars or motorcycles
*  zip between me and I was like, dude, I got to get a motorcycle.
*  And it was maybe the fifth time that I crashed my car in 2022.
*  But I was like, this is going to be the death of me.
*  As Lewis had a moment where he was like, I don't think I should do armored fighting
*  or get a motorcycle.
*  Maybe neither of these are good ideas.
*  I have to trust you because I have to pee.
*  So keep chatting.
*  I don't fuck up my show.
*  Now, OK, listen, it's no you're leaving the number one show
*  in the the number one show in the world being left in the hands of the Legion
*  of Skanks. What could possibly go wrong?
*  Let's take calls.
*  Jamie, open the phone lines.
*  What if it just turns out there's been phone lines the entire time?
*  Just people have been waiting to get on.
*  Jim on three says you got some new ideas for the show.
*  It's all but it's all way behind.
*  It's all a guy who's like, I want to say something to Brian Redban.
*  This is your years late, sir.
*  Yes, I've been on hold for 17 years.
*  This is going well, guys.
*  What do you guys think?
*  He's going pretty well. Does he like us?
*  I mean, you too.
*  I think this Joe fellow has a future in broadcasting.
*  Oh, yeah, he's doing with it.
*  He's doing all right. I'll give him some notes. But
*  man, I tell you what, though, his.
*  His like on air stuff is a Kutraman to the table is very different than ours.
*  It's cooler than ours. We have a racist bear.
*  We have a racist bear. I like to think we're getting there.
*  Yeah, we are.
*  But no one's ever made his art out of drums or stuff like that.
*  This is all really cool stuff.
*  This is an actual dinosaur head.
*  It's a real skull.
*  Yeah, he was like, this is actually a real UFO.
*  We actually went to Mars and found a miniature UFO.
*  Oh, isn't this like a Tyrannosaurus windpipe or something?
*  I don't even think I'm wrong about that.
*  I think it's something like that.
*  Jamie, is that what you're looking at?
*  There might be a walrus dick up there somewhere.
*  It does. It's kind of look like a walrus dick now that you mentioned it.
*  That was pulled out of the permafrost in Alaska.
*  This was. Yes.
*  See how it's like shaved or sawed in there?
*  That was the no one knows why it's all flat like that.
*  That's the top.
*  Dude, if I steal the thing from the permafrost.
*  Everybody take a little thing.
*  They take a commemorative coin.
*  I'm going to take Dice's cigarette.
*  No, I don't need to steal anything. I'll be back.
*  We should leave some shit.
*  Yeah, Dave.
*  Dave, we really dumb you down for the show, huh?
*  Oh, we're having fun, boys.
*  No, I don't think so.
*  Jamie was telling us about this unfrozen walrus dick or something.
*  Yeah, it's a bone.
*  That's it. Oh, no, it's not.
*  We actually have a walrus. What is it?
*  What kind of bone is it? What kind of bone is it?
*  The walrus dick bone.
*  The walrus dick bone. Where is that?
*  Is that in the other studio?
*  It's not up there.
*  We had a walrus dick bone. Is it not very big?
*  It's very fucking huge. It's giant.
*  Wait, the walrus sticks actually have bones?
*  Yeah. What is it called? The proboscis?
*  What is it called? Is that what you call it?
*  Isn't that a nose?
*  Isn't a proboscis a nose?
*  Can you not slow down this podcast with dumb questions like that?
*  It's called a baculum. It's a bone. That's it.
*  That's what they look like. They're giant.
*  And that's an actual walrus' cock.
*  Yeah. That's why they're always hailing Hitler.
*  Big, fancy.
*  Yeah, it's actually a bone
*  because nature doesn't have time for your hard-ons.
*  You get a bone.
*  With us, it's like too complicated to raise kids.
*  Like, you got to be really into this.
*  I want you to be, like, in the mood.
*  Fully committed.
*  Wait, do dogs have bones?
*  Yeah, the dogs have bones.
*  No. Yeah, they do.
*  Yeah, dogs have bones.
*  Isn't it a recent...
*  Are you fucking with me right now, Joe?
*  I think cats have bones.
*  I don't know if dogs have bones.
*  Isn't the Loch Ness Monster actually like a whale
*  flipping upside down and his cock coming out of the water?
*  Nah.
*  I've heard that...
*  The Loch Ness Monster photo, the famous one, is fake as fuck.
*  But they said it's actually...
*  The dogs have dick bones.
*  If you see a whale flipping over on its back and its dick comes out,
*  it's what it looks like.
*  They said it probably much could have been that.
*  Nah, it's horse shit.
*  Or it's a sturgeon, probably a sturgeon.
*  Canine baculum.
*  Yeah, I guess they have dog dicks.
*  They have fucking bones.
*  Dogs have a bone in their penis.
*  Yeah, so they have the same thing, baculum.
*  It doesn't taste like it has a bone in it.
*  I think...
*  I think it's only us.
*  I think the chips and the primates are the only ones that God doesn't trust.
*  Like, you can't have a bone.
*  You just use it all day long.
*  You never build houses.
*  It's a good... God made the right call on that one.
*  100%.
*  You don't want to give us a bone.
*  It's too easy for us to fuck, so the bone dies off.
*  That's probably what happened.
*  Because it's too easy.
*  Because if we just bred...
*  Like, we're already overpopulated.
*  We've... Not really, but...
*  I mean, if you wanted to look at us compared to any other animal,
*  the balance is way off.
*  There's way more of us than there are of them.
*  We're everywhere.
*  We're on every fucking part of the country.
*  Every part of the world.
*  Some primates do have one.
*  Which ones?
*  Oh, we got robbed.
*  The cool ones?
*  This is gorilla and chimpanzees.
*  The baculum with the dog's penis.
*  Did you watch that thing yet?
*  I think I hit the lady who had the chimp crazy on HBO.
*  I loved it.
*  Did you say gorillas have them?
*  What's that?
*  Gorillas have the bones.
*  So that's exactly what happened.
*  You do not want to get fucked by a gorilla.
*  We developed agriculture in cities and the bone went away.
*  Because then we would just fuck all day.
*  We would never figure out cities.
*  Well, it said chimps have them, which are supposed to be our closest...
*  No houses.
*  No phones.
*  Where's their cell phone?
*  They wanted to get a cell phone, you got to lose the bone.
*  Constantly jerking off and throwing shit at each other.
*  It's like whatever the common ancestor of us and chimps is,
*  that was the split.
*  They were like, look, we're going to go in this direction where we build civilization.
*  And the chimps were like, we're going to keep our dick bones.
*  So, good luck.
*  That's exactly what happened.
*  They had a conversation about it.
*  They're like, I get it.
*  I understand why you want to do it.
*  The female has one?
*  She has a bone in her clitoris.
*  Damn.
*  Imagine how hard she comes.
*  Damn.
*  Wait, there's a clit bone?
*  Yeah, buddy.
*  It's connected to the clit bone.
*  Well, it probably has to be because all animals that are mammals, they start off as female
*  anyway.
*  Right?
*  It's the same process, I think, for primates in that.
*  That's why boy dogs have nipples.
*  So you're saying me and Lewis' penises aren't done yet?
*  We haven't grown into them?
*  There is definitely a market for grinding down dick bones and fucking putting them in
*  your drinks or something.
*  Energy drinks?
*  Oh yeah.
*  In China, it's probably right up there with tiger bones.
*  I guarantee it.
*  I guarantee it that they grind dick bones down in certain cultures.
*  Well, in certain cultures, they will want to drink rhino tea because it's naughty.
*  They know rhinos are an endangered species, but they cut their fucking horns off just
*  to make tea.
*  It's supposed to make your dick hard.
*  For real.
*  It's like a fucking...
*  Probably just because it's so crazy.
*  It's because it's naughty.
*  I'm a naughty boy.
*  I'm going to serve you some...
*  Imagine you go over a guy's house like, what a fucking house.
*  Look at this guy.
*  You want some fucking rhino horn tea?
*  Wow, you've got the real shit.
*  Do you want to fuck a dodo bird?
*  That guy's got a raccoon dick around his neck.
*  A raccoon?
*  They sell them on Amazon.
*  They sell them?
*  Oh, I need one.
*  That is awesome.
*  For sure.
*  Look at that.
*  For sure.
*  Look at that going, yeah.
*  Tiger penis.
*  I need a raccoon bone dick.
*  Yeah, but you want a raccoon one.
*  You want a fucking like a big old...
*  Wolf.
*  Yeah.
*  A wolf dick.
*  A wolf dick.
*  A bigger dick.
*  With a nice open shirt.
*  That's what happened.
*  We were like, I don't need the dick bone.
*  I want to figure out space travel.
*  You can't figure out space travel if you have that dick bone.
*  It's one or the other.
*  Can this thing go away a little bit?
*  Once they develop the bulletproof skin, the next thing is going to be a reemergence of
*  the dick bone.
*  And then...
*  The dick bone starts coming back.
*  That's it, Viagra.
*  They're going to be like, fuck you, earn it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That would be...
*  You know?
*  You'd put a lot of...
*  Viagra tries to stop bulletproof skin because of the...
*  Because this thing goes all the way up the ladder.
*  You've got to follow the money.
*  It's going to be a bulletproof dick bone for sure.
*  If you're going to put a dick bone in there, why make it a regular bone?
*  It's like one that can't break if a girl gets crazy.
*  The CEO of Viagra, like as this podcast is out, is in a room somewhere going, they're
*  talking about it on the Joe Rogan Experience.
*  All right.
*  This threatens our entire business model.
*  Once AI goes live, that's going to be one of the first things we fix.
*  Bring back the dick bone.
*  We've already devolved enough.
*  We realize there's like a limit.
*  You get to the end of the road and civilization has to collapse and start over again.
*  But in the meantime, we're going to need that dick bone back.
*  That might be the thing that drives the collapse.
*  Yeah.
*  Once you get the dick bone, there's no more need for civilization.
*  No.
*  I think civilization collapses and then the re-emergence of the dick bone becomes a necessity
*  because you have to fuck very quickly because you get needed by animals.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  I get it.
*  Yeah.
*  And so there's madness, cannibal gangs in the streets, fucking block takeovers, times
*  a million.
*  Juggalos.
*  Here we go.
*  We're all back.
*  We're right back here.
*  And you're going to need a dick bone because you have 13 seconds to impregnate your wife
*  and then hope that neither one of you gets eaten on the way to the lake.
*  You're like, that was my third wife, by the way.
*  I'll have a fourth one soon.
*  Bro.
*  I can't figure out.
*  Is this the skull of a wendingo, an evil mythical forest creature?
*  No, that's a mule deer.
*  It's a mule deer.
*  It's just a regular deer.
*  Did you kill that one?
*  Yeah, it was the first animal I ever killed.
*  They told us you killed the crocodile that's out there.
*  It's an alligator.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  Sorry, Joe.
*  That's mis-gendering to Joe.
*  I just watched Joe actually get mad at me.
*  No, no, no, I didn't, but crocodiles are like, that's a bigger accomplishment.
*  That's a scarier animal, way scarier.
*  That is a huge alligator.
*  It's a big ass alligator.
*  That is a massive beast.
*  It's a big ass alligator.
*  Wait, the crocodile is scarier than the alligator?
*  Oh, yeah, way scarier.
*  And what is it that makes them scarier?
*  They're way bigger, way more aggressive.
*  Some of us are here to learn.
*  We look stupid now because of that dumb ass question, dude.
*  They're fucking terrifying, man.
*  They found a bunch of them in the Everglades in Florida.
*  You know, the same assholes that let loose their fucking pythons.
*  Pythons.
*  There's a bunch of them that let loose some giant Nile crocodiles.
*  Oh, is it the guy that was, he's riding the fan boat through it, and then all of a sudden
*  the ground is more alligator?
*  Oh, that's a different one.
*  I think that's in Costa Rica.
*  I think that video.
*  I don't think that video is in America.
*  It might actually be a different kind of crocodile.
*  It might be in the Amazon.
*  I don't believe that's America.
*  But the ones in America, the ones they're spotting, they have like a kill on sight order
*  for them in the Everglades.
*  Because if you have a fucking population of breeding Nile crocodiles in the Everglades,
*  it's over.
*  It's fuck your golf.
*  Like, they're hunting people.
*  Dude, kill on sight is a funny thing.
*  If you're unarmed, you just see what's out there, they go,
*  the government said I gotta kill this thing on sight.
*  Like, let's go, motherfucker.
*  How do you kill an alligator?
*  You have to shoot it.
*  How many to date have they killed in the Everglades?
*  Because they've spotted, it's more than four, I think.
*  So the problem is they don't look through much of the Everglades.
*  It's too crazy.
*  It's so thick.
*  The whole middle of Florida is like, Florida's the dick of the country, and that dick is infested with monster soup.
*  It's just pythons and fucking crocodiles and alligators everywhere, and there's no mammals left.
*  Like, 90% of the mammals in the Everglades are gone.
*  The crocodiles just fucking...
*  The snakes.
*  No, the pythons.
*  The snakes have gone.
*  The pythons have killed everything.
*  Pythons have killed everything.
*  That's just very recent.
*  Yes.
*  Right?
*  Pythons are killing alligators.
*  They eat alligators.
*  Jesus.
*  American crocs, it says when I look it up.
*  No, no, no.
*  Nile crocodiles in the Everglades, for sure.
*  I was watching a news thing.
*  Nile crocs in the Everglades.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  Wow.
*  That's something on Reddit.
*  Yeah.
*  Ten years ago.
*  Ten years ago, someone caught a...
*  There's been more than one, though.
*  I think there's been four different ones that they've caught.
*  I don't know how my algorithm got this, but it was like, if you ever get attacked by...
*  It must have been a crocodile.
*  Maybe it was an alligator, but they told you what to do.
*  You ain't doing shit.
*  Can I guess?
*  You punch it in the nose and put it through its brain like a polypate?
*  By the way, step one is always stay calm.
*  Yeah, no.
*  First thing you want to do...
*  Do I play dead?
*  Do I ask, what do I do?
*  Hilarious, stay calm.
*  You got to roll with it because it's going to try to roll you, right?
*  And then if you have an opportunity, play dead because then it'll think you're dead.
*  Or it said punch it in its nose, which is the funniest thing.
*  I was right.
*  Or take it in its eyes.
*  All of it's hilarious.
*  You ain't doing shit.
*  Tickle it.
*  Try tickling it in different places.
*  You ain't doing shit.
*  My friend Jim Shocky...
*  You don't know that, Joe.
*  I might be able to tickle a fucking alligator.
*  My friend Jim Shocky got sent to Africa to hunt them because they were killing these
*  people in this village.
*  Everybody in the village was like missing a hand.
*  They all had like bites taken out of them.
*  These crocodiles were like targeting these people like they were food.
*  And so they brought in this professional hunter, this guy who's a friend of mine, Jim Shocky.
*  And he went to Africa and shot these crocodiles.
*  And while he was there, one of the ladies got taken.
*  One of the ladies was washing clothes in the river and they fucking snatched out and grabbed
*  her.
*  Maybe don't wash clothes in the river.
*  This is how crazy it is.
*  They develop like a system where they stick logs in the ground in like this circular area
*  because they think the crocodiles can't come through it.
*  But I think the crocodiles are figuring out how to go on the ground when everyone's sleeping
*  and slip right into that and wait.
*  Don't lions do that shit in Africa too?
*  Like they really hunt humans, right?
*  Oh, they have.
*  They'll really like plan it out and shit.
*  Did you ever see that Val Kilmer movie?
*  They have people whistles.
*  They go, sup dude.
*  Sup dude.
*  No, it would be like, who wants a hug?
*  Who wants a pussy?
*  Who wants a pussy?
*  I got wild pussy in the woods.
*  Are you guys hearing that?
*  I'm going to go check this out real quick.
*  I'm horny.
*  I'm horny.
*  I want to suck your dick.
*  Why doesn't the alien, the predator, like the guy who comes down and fucks people up,
*  why doesn't he hunt us that way?
*  With calls.
*  Wouldn't that be more exciting for him?
*  Instead of just running people down and fucking taking their heads?
*  That's a mercenary.
*  We literally hunt animals by getting them horny first.
*  Trick them into going on a wellness retreat.
*  Set it up like a deer blind, like a wellness retreat.
*  Dude, if you're a duck, you think you're about to get laid and you fucking just get blasted
*  in the head?
*  Well, they think it's a safe place to land.
*  It's even more despicable.
*  They take rubber ducks and they put them everywhere like, oh, it's a party, duck party, everybody's
*  happy.
*  And then you come in and just imagine being a duck and just getting blasted out of the
*  sky like, how?
*  Yeah, that sucks.
*  I thought I had to worry about dogs and things like that.
*  I didn't think I'd worry about getting blasted out of the fucking sky.
*  Duck is delicious though.
*  It is.
*  It's delicious meat.
*  And it's probably fun to blast them out of the sky.
*  I haven't done that particular activity, but I bet it's a good time.
*  Just fucking pop the hatch, boom, boom, boom.
*  And then you cook them up that night.
*  Nice.
*  Yeah, it's got to be a lot of fun.
*  But you got to be careful you don't eat a buckshot.
*  That's a real issue because you don't always get all the little BBs because a shotgun you
*  shoot it up there, it's a scatter.
*  That's how you can shoot birds.
*  Not for the migrants, dude.
*  They just grab them, break their neck and cook them up.
*  That's the better way to do it, really.
*  No buckshot.
*  Yeah, no buckshot needed.
*  No buckshot needed.
*  Get those bitch ass domesticated ducks that are subject to grabbing.
*  Those park ducks.
*  They don't know any better yet.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I assume you can't just eat like, lake duck.
*  You could.
*  Can you?
*  Yeah, you could.
*  I'm sure you could eat them.
*  I'm saying is there any kind of good that doesn't taste good?
*  When I get beefy duck, is that the same duck that you just see in like, Central Park?
*  There's different kinds of ducks.
*  Some ducks are called diver ducks and those are the least appetizing because diver ducks
*  go all the way down to the bottom of the, where the ground is, the bottom of the lake
*  and they eat all the algae and all the bullshit and like anything that's down there, they
*  eat anything.
*  They eat dead fish and all kinds of rotten things and the idea is that they're not very
*  tasty.
*  But the other ducks, there's like mallards and different ducks that like people hunt.
*  They don't dive.
*  You know, they eat things that are like on the surface.
*  They don't go down and eat the muck.
*  But I've had diver duck that was really well prepared by a chef.
*  This guy owns Dai Douwei in town.
*  It's an amazing restaurant and he cooked it fantastic.
*  It was awesome.
*  And this is the ones who eat all the bad shit, but it still tastes good?
*  You can, yeah, you could still do it right.
*  It's just an involved process.
*  You know, like he had to, he brined them and did a bunch of different things, marinated
*  them, but ultimately you can't eat them.
*  But I think like a regular duck, the kind that are like sitting on the pond, you could
*  snatch one of those up.
*  I bet it would be just like a regular duck that you would shoot out of the sky.
*  It's just a duck.
*  Well, fellas, we know what we're doing after this.
*  I mean, if you came from a country where there's no food and all of a sudden they flew you
*  into Ohio, they're like, why are we all here?
*  No one tells you not to eat the ducks.
*  There's just ducks there.
*  None of that.
*  Maybe you don't even speak English.
*  So there's all these signs saying don't kill the ducks.
*  And you say, oh, look, ducks.
*  Kill ducks.
*  Kill ducks.
*  Wouldn't you automatically grab a duck if you came from a place where there was no food?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  No, I'm not blaming the Haitians.
*  Peking duck is the most popular duck to eat.
*  Peking duck meat is known for its mild, satisfying flavor, easily adapts to a number of cuisines.
*  There's a lighter flesh and milder flavor.
*  So this is a duck.
*  This is Peking.
*  Peking is a type.
*  But this is like domestic ducks.
*  That's what they're showing here.
*  So like if you buy duck in a restaurant, you're not really buying wild duck.
*  You're buying a domesticated duck.
*  But there's wild ducks that taste really good.
*  And there's wild ducks that are a little funky.
*  And those are the ones that they call diver ducks.
*  Yeah, there's like fish.
*  I remember fishing in Puerto Rico.
*  We went deep sea fishing.
*  And there's like certain fish that like they eat.
*  I guess the bigger the fish were, like they eat like all the algae and stuff off the reef.
*  And I guess if the fish was really big, you had to like throw it back because you can
*  get like really sick.
*  I think it's the toxins from the fish they eat.
*  They eat stuff off the reef.
*  Oh, right.
*  You're right about that, actually.
*  Yeah.
*  We caught some barracuda.
*  And they're like, on this area, you can keep them.
*  But if you catch them over there, you can't keep them.
*  You can't eat them.
*  It's weird.
*  It's like it's in especially with like big game species, because those there's ones
*  that they just won't eat.
*  It's too risky.
*  It's pretty wacky.
*  We went fishing on a perch tour this summer and they caught a fish.
*  And it looked like he was going to like I thought he was going to like gut the fish
*  right there on the boat.
*  But what he was doing was when you pull them up very fast, they get like the bends.
*  So it looks so violent, but they're actually saving the fish.
*  You're going to throw them back and they like just like stab them almost like underneath
*  the thing.
*  And like it just like lets the air out and they're able to live.
*  Fish get the bends?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  The fear that their body has to be under when they're like 500 feet underwater is insane.
*  And so when they go to the top, their organs like come out through their mouth.
*  It's crazy.
*  So yeah, they're all filled up.
*  So they just like you like let the air out of a balloon and then the fish start moving
*  again.
*  You throw them back.
*  I cooked a lobster once and you're supposed to put the knife into the back of its head.
*  You're not supposed to just boil it.
*  But I couldn't do it.
*  I was like, there's no way.
*  That's what it looks like.
*  The guy's eyeballs pop out and his tongue pops out.
*  I've seen that happen.
*  Looks kind of like Ori.
*  It's very bizarre.
*  A lot like Ori.
*  It looks like a wacky like a card you'd get at Spencer's.
*  Isn't there a fish called a Jewfish?
*  There is, right?
*  That's gefilte fish.
*  But that's I mean, imagine what that does to your body going from 500 feet down in the
*  fucking ocean to pulling up to the top.
*  Yeah.
*  Just pops out.
*  Yeah, that doesn't sound fun.
*  Why isn't that not the case?
*  That's probably exactly what would happen if you went to the moon and took your helmet
*  off.
*  Well, we've never really gone.
*  That's what Total Recall said happens on Mars.
*  Jewfish.
*  There you go.
*  Overpopulation.
*  There we go.
*  Do you think the other fish?
*  Can you pull up the Hitlerfish, please?
*  It's a Goliath?
*  That's what it is?
*  There's only one person who's going to...
*  Goliath grouper.
*  Only one fish can get to the bottom of this problem.
*  Do they have a disproportionate control of the fish media?
*  I'm just wondering.
*  Is that the...
*  Who's running the fish banks?
*  A Jewfish is a Goliath grouper?
*  Yeah, when I popped it in, the Google says Atlantic Goliath grouper.
*  Whoa.
*  Look at that motherfucker.
*  Well, hello.
*  I'm here for your rent money.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Look at that picture with the diver.
*  Give me your rent money.
*  Look at that picture with the diver.
*  That's fucking insane.
*  Wow.
*  That's like a large mouth bass that could eat a person.
*  If I saw that, I would think that I was about to be murdered.
*  I would not be comfortable with that thing being right next to me.
*  That's a giant predator.
*  I would think that I'm a trunk.
*  Am I inside of a small fish tank?
*  Bro, if you were a little kid, if you were a four-year-old kid and you went diving, free
*  diving near that, there's a real likelihood that thing swallows you.
*  800 pounds.
*  800 pounds.
*  Oh yeah, a Jewfish eating your baby.
*  What?
*  Let's spread that rumor.
*  You ever seen a large mouth bass take out a duckling?
*  No, but I want to now.
*  They take them out.
*  They take out birds.
*  There's a guy that was developing a lure for...
*  There's a giant pike called a muskie.
*  They're notoriously hard to catch and they're enormous, like real ancient fish.
*  Looks like a monster.
*  They're hard to catch.
*  They call them the fish of 10,000 casts.
*  This guy developed a lure for them that's a duck.
*  It's a little duckie moving across the water.
*  It's very effective for it.
*  It's muskies like the fuck up ducks.
*  They're huge, dude.
*  They're this big.
*  You ever seen one?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  Pull up a photo.
*  It's like David got one on a... right here.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  That's a large mouth bass.
*  Google muskie.
*  Just Google giant muskie.
*  That's them.
*  Wow.
*  Look at that thing.
*  Fucking things are crazy and they're super predators.
*  They take out ducks and all kinds of things.
*  If you want to catch them, you have to have a big ass lure.
*  Look at that.
*  Look at the size of their fucking mouth.
*  It's just covered in teeth like a barracuda.
*  Is there a video of one of these things like eating a duck?
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  If you have to catch it, you have to dress like Antifa.
*  Yeah.
*  When you freeze, you're dick off.
*  Those guys are cold as fuck.
*  Those guys are cold as fuck.
*  Jews won't replace us.
*  He hit it with a bike lock.
*  You got to catch those motherfuckers in some cold ass water just like Northern Pike.
*  Jew fish will not replace us.
*  Look at this.
*  Giant muskie eats a duck.
*  Here it goes.
*  Come on, baby.
*  Oh.
*  What an asshole.
*  You dick.
*  Fake this out, cocksucker.
*  Oh, I thought that was it.
*  That was solid though.
*  Muskie!
*  It wasn't bad.
*  Okay.
*  Muskie eats duck.
*  You got to sit through that.
*  Okay.
*  Is this a duck lure?
*  Yeah.
*  Unless he's got a duck with a hook through it, that monster.
*  Isn't that fucked up?
*  Like you hate mice.
*  You kill mice with a mousetrap.
*  But if you went fishing with a mice and a hook, people would be like, oh, you piece
*  of shit.
*  What is wrong with you?
*  Well, they do it in other pictures.
*  They do it like live bait, right?
*  You put it right through their eyes.
*  Right.
*  But if you did that to a mouse, everybody would get very upset with you.
*  Not me.
*  You would be like, oh, I'm going to kill you.
*  I'm going to kill you.
*  I'm going to kill you.
*  I'm going to kill you.
*  You can torture a mouse for all I care.
*  I got lost on a YouTube journey once with a guy who made homemade mousetraps and he would
*  like create little systems to drown mice and rats in buckets.
*  It was great.
*  Oh yeah.
*  They get like sent to like a bucket.
*  Yeah.
*  Was that it?
*  It's crazy.
*  That is a little crazy.
*  It's New York, right?
*  Yeah.
*  His system of mice and rats and it just catches them and puts them in the buckets to drown.
*  And then the guy's the end of the month, he just has like a bucket of mice and it's so
*  crazy.
*  You guys see that Netflix documentary Rats?
*  No.
*  It's all about rats in New York City, rats all over the country.
*  No, I wouldn't watch that.
*  Rats all over the world.
*  Oh, it's fucking horrible.
*  There's, I think the biomass of rats in New York City is equal or greater to the biomass
*  of human beings.
*  Oh yeah.
*  There are so many rats in New York City, dude.
*  You know how nuts that is?
*  Think about how many people are walking on the street and think about the idea that the
*  number of rats is greater.
*  But any nation people in rats.
*  Do you know that rats eat cockroaches and cockroaches eat rat shit?
*  Do you know how horrible the entire underneath New York City is?
*  Circulapy.
*  This is a bullshit estimate.
*  This is the estimate that there are approximately 3 million rats in New York City, which is
*  close to a third of the city's human population.
*  No, way more.
*  It's a 50% increase from a decade ago.
*  This is the AI overview.
*  Although we do have a rat czar now, so maybe she's doing her shit.
*  I think the documentary was saying that there, here it is right here.
*  There are 8.2 million humans, average mass of 70 kilograms, about 2 million rats.
*  That is not true.
*  Who knows how many?
*  One said there's 2 million, one said there's 3 million.
*  What's going to be not safe for her because there's a girl saying it with her pussy?
*  It got deleted?
*  There's no good measurement of how many rats there are.
*  There's not like a guy going down there like, everybody hold still, 14, 15.
*  How would you possibly know?
*  You cannot.
*  They're just justifying their job just like the people in the homeless commission.
*  There's no fucking way you can tell me how many rats there are in New York City.
*  No, there's no fucking way.
*  I parked my car once, it was back in the day when you had to use cell phones, or pay phones
*  rather, and I was pumping gas, it was in the Bronx, and I went over to this pay phone and
*  I'm on the pay phone and I'm watching rats jump onto the wheel of my car, jump into the
*  engine bay, jump all around it.
*  They were coming out of the sewer and jumping on the car.
*  It was two minutes on the phone going, what the fuck?
*  I didn't realize until I lived in the city what a problem that is.
*  Rats will go inside, if you leave your car sitting for days at a time, rats will get
*  inside and chew wires and fucking like fuck your car.
*  It's crazy.
*  So it says for over 100 years nearly everyone has believed New York is about 8 million rats,
*  a ratio of one human to one rat.
*  The theory began in the 1900s when author and rat expert W.R. Boelter hypothesized that
*  in England there was a ratio of one human to one rat.
*  However, Albach points out that the hypothesis was erroneously applied to New York City and
*  is widely quoted to this day.
*  Many expert has debunked.
*  You know what, I lost a lot of faith in experts over the last few years.
*  I like to see some fucking data.
*  You know, it's actually 36 humans to one rat.
*  I don't know about that.
*  I don't think you know that.
*  I don't think you know.
*  I mean under under the grounds like how do you possibly know the entire subway systems
*  are full of fucking rats.
*  Didn't you say after that Jamie someone said it's one to one.
*  What does it say?
*  It said in 1950 the New York City Health Department went back to one to one.
*  OK. That's probably more accurate.
*  And it's probably even worse now.
*  There's no fucking way you know the whole the tunnels.
*  It's all filled.
*  Oh dude. Rats are everywhere.
*  In the city. And we all you know lived in the city for years and years.
*  But Jay still does.
*  But they'll be every now and then they'll just be like a block where there's like
*  construction or something like that.
*  Like there's something open in the ground and you just have to walk through and you
*  just have to like stomp your way through it because there's just rats everywhere.
*  It's the fucking worst.
*  It's like it feels like your skin is like I've never seen it with rats before.
*  But I will say I found out what it was after.
*  But I'm talking about a first time New York thing happening was I was just outside
*  smoking a cigarette on my stoop when I was in the East Village.
*  And all of a sudden I was like hmm that's weird.
*  Three roaches walking by in the daylight for like that's kind of weird.
*  You don't see that a lot.
*  Just like you know it's like three different times three different roaches.
*  I'm like that's pretty strange.
*  And then several more and then I'm telling you and I'm telling you me within five
*  minutes falling off the buildings.
*  Our superintendent came out and he was like what's going on.
*  And then we saw him landing on his shoulder.
*  He was freaking out. And then we went inside came out a couple hours.
*  And later and there was thousands of them down the street.
*  And I go what happened.
*  He goes oh that's what they do in New York whenever they like bomb a building for
*  like roaches it just shoots them to other buildings.
*  They just come that's what it was.
*  He goes oh one building.
*  They're probably trying to sell a building.
*  So they bombed it for our roaches.
*  And it just sends tens of thousands of them out into the street.
*  Millions I mean I'm told when I was saying like it wasn't.
*  You couldn't take a step and not be stepping on like the carcasses of like 50.
*  Yeah.
*  But they just do they like water flying the big ones New York. That's the ones Jay's talking about
*  The most disgusting creature in the world those water bugs in New York City. That's what we used to call
*  Oh, it was crawling and then also just takes flight and comes at you
*  You're like well, it's like one month a year that they actually fly
*  But when they do man, they just become the grossest thing if you want to live in a big city
*  That's just part of the program. Yeah, it's can't get rid of them can't get rid of the rats either
*  It's not like anyone's incompetent. It's too deep. You would have to move out. It's our job to go
*  Let the rats have it. Yeah, you'd have to move out and then nuke it from space
*  Well, there's all types of like I live out in the country now and there's all types of animals that I don't love that are
*  Around but nothing's gross like right like it's like there's like a bobcat that we've caught on our camera a few times
*  I'm like, I don't really want that thing around but it's not yeah, it's cool. It's not like disgusting
*  Gross animals I live a little closer to the city in Jersey. I get some gross animals who we had those
*  What are they one of them? Yeah, Puerto Ricans, you know, what are the things that was like a big problem in New York last summer?
*  Black lives matter right the bugs. Yeah. Oh, they're still there. They're back this year
*  Invasive so it came over in a so in 2020 in the summer of 2020
*  Starts
*  They were brought over they were doing work on the highline but I know they said in the summer of 2020
*  We started seeing these little bugs we had never seen before and they said they're supposed to kill it
*  You're almost that you're supposed to kill it if you see it and immediately we're like I don't work for you government
*  I'm not going around killing your bugs and then by the next summer
*  There was like ten times as many the next summer there were like ten times
*  They look like moths with like a red underbelly or kind of yeah, they're like a little red
*  They're almost kind of pretty looking until there's a bunch of them and they kind of fly
*  I thought they were like beautiful little butterflies and I was like, oh they're nice
*  And then I heard that they were a problem and then they skeeved me out like they fuck up plants, but they came over
*  The highline in New York was doing something they brought in plants from China and they came in years that why yeah
*  So they came in all to the docks and these plants from China and now it's just they are there and it's it's crazy
*  It's about a month month and a half
*  They are a like the roof of my building probably pull that up Jamie like New York
*  Can't go on the roof of my building like there's
*  Saving like tens of thousands of them all over there. There was a lady up there one time
*  I walked up there covered in them like fucking Candyman
*  I
*  Was accepting but they're
*  Evolving to in the fact that the first year that I was aware of them the first year
*  I was aware of them you could step on them and they didn't really do much
*  Now they fly and they run around
*  If you have no screen on your window if you open a window and you're there will be hundred of them in a room
*  Oh my god, that's so disgusting
*  Only like this for like two weeks last summer, but there were two weeks where my yard was unusable
*  Yeah, you just could not go
*  Every like however many years they come up out of the ground and locus
*  That's in Jersey as well like the caters are cool though, they make cool sounds they make really
*  You find they're like carcasses like the hollowed out carcasses of bodies all over the place trying to run through your bathroom
*  No, no, and these things are
*  They're killing all like plants and stuff too, yeah, it's really bad, but they're like if you read one article
*  It's like here's New York's five-year plan to get rid of the lantern flies and the next articles like no
*  They're just here. This is gonna be a money
*  China got us twice
*  Two strikes China, don't you try this shit again?
*  Do they land right on your face on your head and your body?
*  Did they come over in some sort of a cargo ship or something?
*  I think it was like it was with implants that they were bringing a good. I'm pretty sure Fauci made them
*  They're pretty cool-looking
*  Maybe they can vaccinate us that way
*  Genetically engineer mosquitoes to run around people
*  They would do this thing in my old place
*  We used to like on we'd have like on this there's like a sliding glass door
*  And we'd have just like the screen open and it was like in the weeks where it was bad every 10 minutes
*  You'd look over there, and there's like four of them on there
*  And then you'd hit the screen and they kind of fly off
*  But then they just fly right back and if you like left the room and came back you'd come back and there's 50 of them
*  Like on your screen. It's just gross
*  Yes, not fun. I'm a real chick when it comes to bugs and creepy things. You're normal
*  Yeah, people like bugs are weird. They are weird people keep bugs in their house
*  Angela I'm gonna feed it a mouse
*  Fuck
*  Anything icky is not my thing so I went home with a girl years ago from a diner turns out
*  She was a tarantula. She was a tarantula
*  It was it was weird pets and in the last in the final straw work for I left we didn't hook up because when she
*  Was like oh you got to let my my albino rat crawl on you, and I was like I'm just gonna go like this is not
*  Worth it. I had a buddy who hooked up with this girl. She had a crocodile monitor
*  To the crocodile monitor in her house. It's a pet you can keep it as a pet
*  Wait, what is it? It's a crocodile monitor
*  It's the creepiest looking lizard that you could buy from an exotic pet store you could buy them you could have that
*  Yeah, this girl apparently had that he was like yo red flag
*  Yeah, the girl has an opportunity about an iguana that I hated this lady thought she was on games of Thrones
*  She had her own dragon. She was you said you watched that chimp crazy thing. Yeah, it's lonely old women will can throw
*  Heartfelt emotion into anything in the world
*  Yeah, women are caregivers. What is the
*  Chimps they they want to keep these chimps and raise them this lady this fucking chimp attacked her friend tore her face off
*  I was at the 9-1-1 call. Yeah different the documentary is not about that lady, but they talk about that
*  Oh my gosh, that one is horrifying point is that lady got a chimp after that another one missed having her chimp
*  Even it's cool. It got murdered. I went to that the dock animals place down in Myrtle Beach with my son
*  You know, it's like the one of the it was in the Tiger King Tiger King documentary
*  Yeah, but they didn't have tigers they had like the baby tigers, which was awesome
*  But they had like chimps that came out and they had like it was it was a really really cool experience who twos
*  Educational
*  Yeah, no, it was definitely they were torturing these animals, but it was definitely worth the $500
*  They castrate those chimps to most of them. No the one that one in Connecticut though
*  They didn't the mind-blowing thing was that part of why he like? Oh, yeah
*  Aggressive they're not cast. I had the guys on the guys who made the documentary
*  Oh the show he that chimp crazy thing
*  It's I was blown away actually by how much stuff me like she made them weirdly self-sufficient on something when she throw
*  McDi got McNuggets. Mm-hmm. It wasn't he open the McNuggets then they throw him
*  She goes, oh, here's your sauce like a sweet like a sweet and sour sauce and the monkey knows how to go like like rip
*  Off and like dip dip in it though I kept asking them like did they dip like why do you show that they dipped?
*  Like they just drank that stuff. Oh, yeah, cuz there's a weird line there
*  It's like if they dip you're almost like maybe they deserve rights
*  Yeah, drink them yep, they don't they don't just like bite the top off of uh, yeah
*  Like listen to things too
*  She could say grab that paper and I'll grab the paper give it back to her give her the garbage when she give them McNuggets
*  But she has to keep him in a cage
*  Cuz he's a male he's a grown male and they'll just go crazy and just rip your face off and there's nothing you can do about it
*  They were given that's cool. They were given them Kool-Aid at Doc Anil's place
*  They were like she is they were chugging the Kool-Aid these champs. They were fucking they loved it. They were really scared, dude
*  They came down they like they like and they were like just you weren't at all
*  But I just thought you were about to make a really racist joke
*  They love Kool-Aid you're like easy
*  Come on man
*  No, but like they came down and they were just so like kind of like walking around us
*  They were full so they were like six feet tall. It was fucking dude. That's terrifying
*  Yeah, they were they could you're a full-grown champ
*  They were full-grown champs and they they just felt at any moment that they could just lose their shit and just take over if they
*  Just wanted to at any moment. They could just attack you then that's what you ever see that one with the guy was like with his bear
*  He had a trained bear
*  He had this guy stand still and the guys just stand still the bear just decides to rip his neck off
*  Just out of nowhere. I know I'm thinking of the one
*  Crony joke about it. I was about him today. Yeah, but that's a different one. That's a different
*  This is different this is a guy who's just standing there and it's a bear that was in a bunch of movies
*  It was a bear that was like a trained bear and this bear out of nowhere
*  Just decides to rip this guy's throat apart. What kind of bear a grizzly?
*  Okay, those are the cuz what do I got in Jersey by me? It's the black bear. They're still kill people. Oh, yeah
*  They killed a kid at Rutgers
*  It is
*  When someone has to scream though like the name they give like chimpanzees and stuff like mr. Man
*  He's biting her fingers
*  Funny it's a funny thing because especially like little kids like they all of their like stories and shows and it's all like nature
*  personified and things like that like I remember like um
*  My uh my daughter when she was like three asking me why like bugs are running away from her
*  It's like why is the spider running away or whatever it is. It's like she's honey
*  It's like well, you know, he thinks you're gonna kill it cuz you might actually kill it
*  But then you almost bears especially the young ones look so fucking cute. You just look at them
*  I see a bear cub you're dead already tiger cub
*  Cute it's dirty
*  The awful thing of it that's the problem with like they said about like having chimpanzees as pets is like for a while
*  It's totally fine. And then one day it's just not and that one that uh, rip the ladies face off
*  did you see like that video they show a video of like they should have known this was kind of gonna happen because a
*  kid one time picked up a shoe off the floor that like
*  The the monkey wanted and then he goes over and he's coming after me
*  It looks a little aggressive, but it's still like he's not that big
*  So it doesn't look that scary
*  But then we just makes a move like to grab at the shirt and whatever and you see the kid like almost falls over
*  He's like whoa, whoa, whoa
*  And they have to like all kind of jump in front of the monkey like yeah over something
*  He's unaware the guys didn't know he did wrong
*  He just grabbed the shoe off the floor and the monkey wanted that shoe and didn't know how to tell him
*  I think you just decided to beat the fucker. Yeah kid and it doesn't
*  Right, that's what they did they did your fingers off. Yeah, they tear your generals off so you can't
*  Procreate anymore. They'll bite your feet off
*  Yeah, really don't shit don't keep them as you know what they don't do they don't kill people and that crazy
*  They just maim you just rip you apart. That's what's really nuts. They don't they won't kill people
*  They don't kill people. There's very few instances of chimpanzees killing people
*  They kill these guys are saying they kill people like as far as like little kids get snatched up in Africa
*  You know
*  Like if you're a child like a baby and you're near aggressive hungry chimpanzees and you leave the kid alone they could still steal your kid
*  There's been instances them stealing kids
*  Yeah, well they eat monkeys all the time that that I've seen videos of which is insane
*  I think I saw you playing it on the show chimps eating monkeys eating monkeys is like dark
*  Well, they know they didn't know they did it until Attenborough went into the woods and he started filming and then he got this footage
*  Of these chimps setting up an ambush on these monkeys and they rip them apart while they're alive
*  Yeah, they torture got him alive and he's just eating a fucking dick first
*  Pulling chunks of meat off of them
*  It's when they're ripping arms off and handing it to their friends and you see the just because we're so related to them
*  It's so much more gruesome. But like I did I watch like nature's metal
*  It's a great follow at Instagram and I just did I watch fucking a line like eat a baby out of an antelope stomach and like
*  Just swallow it like a pill. You're like, oh, that's awesome. Horrible. Komodo dragons are the scariest. They just swallow everything whole
*  Oh
*  All four legs are hanging out of the mouth still you know animals have there's not a lot of
*  Emotion in their faces of those two like those lizards. So like they eat a whole goat and they're just like
*  Yeah, there's like on the next thing no highs no lows
*  To use a fucking goat like you're watching a bird eat a mammal. It's just one of the weird
*  It just doesn't look like it should happen
*  So I get it to be like a bird like it'll be like a seabird a big a seagull and I'll like pick up a
*  squirrel and just
*  Rats they kill rats all the time. They don't swallow them whole this is crazy videos of seagulls swallowing rats hole
*  Alright, we got to bring the seagulls into Manhattan
*  We'll figure out the seagull problem
*  Your cat they're gonna eat everything once they run out of rats what they won't
*  Well, that's one of the reasons why the Hollywood Hills aren't filled with rats is because the coyotes
*  Right the more coyotes there are the less rats we are one time in
*  I think actually it was the last time that we all did
*  Your show together the three of us did it and it was back when you were in LA and I was staying in some Airbnb
*  out in the hills and
*  me and my wife
*  Heard we were literally sleeping at night and we heard I believe
*  coyotes attacking a dog
*  And it was like the saddest thing to hear because you just you you hear them like come up and then it's like
*  30-second so the dog like and
*  My wife loves dogs. She was like crying and she's like we have to do something and I was like we will be doing nothing
*  But letting this happen you can't do it's already too late. That's pitch-black outside. I was gonna go out there with a lantern
*  What a pussy they usually don't kill people the last time a coyote killed a person on record was
*  There's a Canadian folk singer she lived in a part of Canada where the coyotes had started eating moose
*  Because they were running out of things to eat and they they realized that if they bite on mooses legs
*  Especially like young mooses they could take them out and then they could eat them and kill them
*  So they were going after thing they were accustomed to going after things larger than them
*  So they started to learn they kill this lady. Wow, and we know female folks singers. They are big
*  I don't think she was in fact, I think she was pretty small. It might have been an honest mistake
*  They thought it was a moose like we were used to this and that's how much folk music sucks
*  Or they don't give a fuck about you
*  That's more likely you live in a place where there's actual bears like New Jersey so bad that the mayor ran on a platform
*  Of having bears the bear hunting be removed and then once he was in office
*  He was like fuck that start hunting them again
*  Yeah, because there's so many human bear interact New Jersey has more bears per capita than anywhere in the lower 48
*  Yeah, really yeah, New Jersey New Jersey got a lot of bears
*  Yeah, we had a lot of crazy wild mountains
*  Why because the thing is forget about the like the was it Ramapo mountains like it's it's gets rural as shit
*  Oh shit, man, Jersey York called the Garden State
*  Yeah, but everyone when they think of Jersey to think of Newark
*  Jersey sure became so big that we say Jersey now
*  You're imagining a dyed hair and the fucking fist bumping eyes most of New Jersey is not anything like that. It's just
*  mountains and woods
*  Yeah, there's like rednecks in New Jersey. Oh, yeah, you ever see the movie out of the furnace like explores that whole thing was a
*  Christian Bale Casey Affleck Willem Dafoe
*  Oh really and willie harrelson played the character of like those like mountain people
*  Like just you know meth trade cousin fucking it's like it's really like they make it like a weird place
*  Or no, it's Jersey. It's Jersey side. It's actually on the border of it says Ramapo mountains. I think yeah
*  Jim Miller UFC fighter lives in New Jersey in like the woods. Yep. Yeah, Sparta, New Jersey that
*  Would think do you everybody thinks smog stacks and yeah, they think it's the smell
*  Well, it's like the same way people think of Pennsylvania
*  They think of Philly and Pittsburgh and shit, but most of Pennsylvania is not they're not producing Jay Okersons out there
*  They're making like it's you but you just went in the lumberjack
*  It's me with a dad that stuck around really told me how the world worked
*  That's where the world gets dark, right?
*  You get born into a spot where there's fucking no way out of here
*  Yeah, you get stuck in the coal mines of West Virginia and you're like shit
*  Like how do I big cities like our good because if you live in a big city
*  There's like people are dreaming and shit if you're like in the middle of nowhere
*  It's like well, even if you're in the suburb of a big city, you know
*  Like if you're if you're in kind of nowhere, but there's a half-hour bus
*  Yeah, so like a city where something's happening, but there's people I remember talking to Jeff Dice. This is really brilliant, dude
*  He's a he was Ron Paul's like chief of staff for years
*  But so where Ron Paul is it's like two hours south of Houston Lake Jackson
*  I think was the name of his district and he was telling me he was like dude
*  There's nothing here. Like there's no like if you're a kid coming up here
*  It's like I don't know we got an Arby's and we got like something
*  There's where so many of those kids join the military because that's like the only or you could do
*  Overlooked option become a jugaloo or join a cult
*  You know, that's that's how you get someone in a cult. It's the best option available
*  You know, okay, can you guys travel try to be a missionary? I'm gonna go to Brazil fuck it
*  I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette. I'm gonna let's wrap this up pop out really three and a half hours in
