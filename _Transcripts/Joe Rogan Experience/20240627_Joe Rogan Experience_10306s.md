# Joe Rogan Experience #1877 - Jann Wenner
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2.88s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10.4s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=13.68s)]
*  Appreciate everything you've done. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=14.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=16.16s)]
*  You have been a part of some wild changes in this country, my friend. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=17.16s)]
*  Well, I think I started my life, my book out at a time in the 50s in the Eisenhower era [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=21.28s)]
*  where none of all of this what we see today was conceivable. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=26.68s)]
*  I mean, little carrying my telephones in your pocket or being able to talk to people, you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=29.84s)]
*  know, on your wristwatch. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=34.68s)]
*  But I came along in the 50s with the post-war baby boom and it was the largest population [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=36.6s)]
*  cohort in American history and it became the most educated, the best educated and also [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=44.36s)]
*  the wealthiest because America was going through this great boom of financial boom after winning [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=49.16s)]
*  the war. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=53.96s)]
*  And when we came of age in the early 60s, when people of my I turned 21 and whatever [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=56.32s)]
*  it was mid 60s. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=64.08s)]
*  So as we grow up, we kind of discovered that America wasn't what we they told us it was [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=66.6s)]
*  going to be, you know, that life, liberty and a pursuit of happiness, which I believed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=73.92s)]
*  in deeply, it wasn't that way. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=78.84s)]
*  You know, in fact, first off, we were running this segregation system, Jim Crow. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=81.16s)]
*  I mean, blacks, people, human beings were kept in the most worst circumstances and it [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=85.56s)]
*  was an outrage to see that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  And then all these other things started becoming apparent, the hypocrisy of the society we [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=92.16s)]
*  were in. And that's the stuff with Dylan was writing about. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=97.36s)]
*  And boom, boom, boom, all of a sudden we're in a war. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  Our young, beautiful president is assassinated. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=103.36s)]
*  The dreams we were told in America weren't quite true. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=107.4s)]
*  We were so it created this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=110.92s)]
*  Crucible, which made us a further, even more unusual generation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=116.84s)]
*  I mean, a generation raised, unfortunately, to not trust the government and to think the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=120.28s)]
*  government's doing wrong in Vietnam and all these things. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=125.12s)]
*  It was disillusioned. So that's how we grew up. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=127.92s)]
*  And it made us more rebellious than ever and more skeptical and in a certain way, deeply [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=130.04s)]
*  committed to human justice and human rights and to caring for people. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=137.32s)]
*  And the things I think became the dominant themes of my generation and music that desire [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=143.24s)]
*  to do good in the world, to make the world a better place. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=148.56s)]
*  It was a giant change in culture. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=150.96s)]
*  I think the change in culture in the 1960s was one of the greatest changes in human [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=152.84s)]
*  history and such a shift from the 50s to the 60s. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=158.36s)]
*  I mean, you know, I always I attribute it to a lot of things. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=162.88s)]
*  The Vietnam era, the for sure the war. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=166.04s)]
*  We like galvanized a lot of people to understand the dangers of not understanding really [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  what's going on with the government and what the country is really all about. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=176.76s)]
*  But also psychedelic drugs, which is really a huge part of it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=180.92s)]
*  Well, let's throw some sugar into the next. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=185.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=187.72s)]
*  But one of the point is our parents, my parents grew up at a time when we fought the United [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=188.72s)]
*  States fought a world war for justice, democracy, defeated the bad guys, victorious. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, the army, the army started integrating America, more European fashion. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=199.36s)]
*  Come on, my generation, our generation grew up with the war in Vietnam, a war we were [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=204.36s)]
*  ashamed of, didn't want to fight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=209.24s)]
*  It split the country in two. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=210.8s)]
*  I mean, so we have entirely different experience. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  But your point that in this crucible, as we got old, I mean, as we started our young [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  maturity and going to college, two giant things happened. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=221.72s)]
*  The emergence of rock and roll and the emergence of drugs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=227.2s)]
*  And I'm at a third, which is the emergence of technology starts about then. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=230.0s)]
*  So I psychedelics were tremendously important in my life to me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  I write about it openly in the book. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=241.56s)]
*  I thought, you know, why cover that up? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=243.44s)]
*  I mean, I took a lot of acid when I was in college. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=246.28s)]
*  I learned lots from it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=249.48s)]
*  It changed my worldview. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=250.88s)]
*  It deepened my love of rock and roll and deepened my love of just the natural world [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=253.28s)]
*  around me, you know, just, wow, everything's so cool and so precious and so unusual. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=258.16s)]
*  Every little bit of it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's a wonderment enhancer. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=264.2s)]
*  And I wonder that's that I express. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=266.08s)]
*  I was trying to figure out how to say it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=269.04s)]
*  And when I said, well, I thought in a way it gave you the sense of the oneness of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=270.32s)]
*  everything and the preciousness of everything. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  And it's hard to describe all that philosophical stuff, but everything is interconnected. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=277.88s)]
*  I mean, at such a fundamental level. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=283.56s)]
*  But this was also the message of music and the two things that just overpowered me and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=286.44s)]
*  changed my life and made me want in the end, start Rolling Stone and bring that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=292.56s)]
*  news to the world. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=296.88s)]
*  What year do you start Rolling Stone? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=297.88s)]
*  Sixty seven. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=299.28s)]
*  Perfect timing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  So in 67, when I started in San Francisco, we had Bill Graham started the first FM [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=301.64s)]
*  Underground radio station started. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=308.52s)]
*  There's Monterey Pop Festival. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=310.32s)]
*  Sergeant Peppers was issued a clear, clear shout out around the world saying, hey, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  come on, let's all have fun. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=318.96s)]
*  Let's get on this love machine together. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=320.55999999999995s)]
*  I mean, it was and Rolling Stone. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=322.28s)]
*  So it's like a real call around the world. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  Are you ready for a brand new beat? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=326.52s)]
*  You know, and wow, the word responded. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=328.04s)]
*  Well, it's such Rolling Stone magazine, particularly then, such an important part of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=331.2s)]
*  the counterculture because there was no voice in mainstream media that was equal to it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=338.52s)]
*  There was nothing like it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=344.2s)]
*  There was no no voice that, you know, spoke to the young people that were dissatisfied [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=345.72s)]
*  with the way things were going. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=352.72s)]
*  If you take a time capsule back to 67, there was nothing about rock and roll in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=354.44s)]
*  magazines, newspapers, television, whatever the mass media was. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  And in fact, the thing with them, Time magazine, they all look down on rock and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=369.32000000000005s)]
*  roll. It's all like raunchy or for teenage girls or nonsense or foolishness. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=373.12s)]
*  I mean, they they didn't like it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=378.48s)]
*  And I don't think there's so much music. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=380.8s)]
*  They didn't like what young people were doing and the threat of rock and roll, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=382.48s)]
*  which was always there was something deeply sexual about it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=385.92s)]
*  And then it was also long hair and all these little things, which I mean, long [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=388.96s)]
*  hair. I mean, come on. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=392.92s)]
*  I mean, you I know, Joe, you don't get this analogy, but I mean, can you imagine [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=394.4s)]
*  people didn't they were you were discriminated because your hairstyle? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=398.84s)]
*  Oh, I get the analogy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=402.4s)]
*  Let alone at the time you would go to jail if you were gay, you know, if you had [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=405.2s)]
*  caught having sex with a man or that you could not drink out of the same water [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  fountain as a white person if you're black. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=413.32s)]
*  I mean, anyway, a far field. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=415.23999999999995s)]
*  But so music was the only medium that young people could speak to each other [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=417.23999999999995s)]
*  and could communicate with each other and share values and ideas. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=424.32s)]
*  And that was kind of the power of it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=427.88s)]
*  And we called it Ralph and we call it the tribal telegraph. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=429.84s)]
*  You know, the music was the glue that was going to hold the generation together. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=434.08s)]
*  And we came we were the only place other than the jukebox and Top 40 Radio where [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=438.24s)]
*  you could hear anything of this music or hear about it or read about or [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=443.84s)]
*  participate in it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=448.2s)]
*  And so we became one of the most more powerful means of communication for the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=449.56s)]
*  generation and certainly this great way in which rock artists could communicate [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=455.08s)]
*  with their audience. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=459.76s)]
*  You know, and John Leonard, Dylan could say what was on their mind or with their [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=460.56s)]
*  intentions or or how they write a song, wrote a song or be taken seriously. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=464.12s)]
*  And we're only so much like a letter from was this love letter from home for or [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=468.8s)]
*  this letter from home for so many people that I meet today and that I've met all [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  through on people saying I live in this small town and you were the lifeline or [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=479.52s)]
*  you know, you meant everything to me in my life. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=483.28s)]
*  Did you have this sense of what it was going to be when you first created it? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=485.96s)]
*  Like, what was the what were the early days like? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=490.44s)]
*  Well, I don't think I was I had no sense of what could become. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I had these kind of grandiose ideas that would be the best magazine in [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  the world, of course, it sells other copies, of course. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, but I had no idea what success really was going to be, how you define it [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=503.79999999999995s)]
*  either financially or spiritually or emotionally or if it's in the world of [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=510.44s)]
*  magazines. You know, it's just like I was on my I was on my trip and we put out [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=514.9599999999999s)]
*  volunteers. So it wasn't like a professional operation. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=520.5200000000001s)]
*  It was we were kids. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  I'd never done it before. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=525.6s)]
*  I knew nothing about the business of it, but people liked it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=527.24s)]
*  And it it just quickly started growing and growing, growing, growing because it [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=530.8800000000001s)]
*  was goodness about something we all loved. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=535.24s)]
*  It was about music. It was the only place you could read about something. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=536.84s)]
*  You're so passionate to me. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=540.12s)]
*  I mean, I that Berkeley experience of taking LSD and going to all the shows [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=542.32s)]
*  every weekend with airplane and Jefferson and the Grateful Dead and Janice and all [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=548.32s)]
*  the groups that were then powerful for me. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=553.28s)]
*  I mean, really, I wanted to be a part of that and listening to The Beatles and the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=555.36s)]
*  Stones and I wanted to be a part of that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=559.24s)]
*  I wanted to be part of that world. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=561.88s)]
*  In a lot of ways, what the Internet is today and this sort of new independent [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=564.88s)]
*  voice, that sort of Rolling Stone was like that for that culture in that era. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  It was there was no other message like that that was out there in mainstream media. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=577.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, yeah, alone. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=584.52s)]
*  And it was kind of like the big one, the biggest stories in American history and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=585.88s)]
*  the mainstream media was missing, which was the boom, the cultural revolution. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=590.5999999999999s)]
*  In which we thought culture, consciousness could be the most powerful way of changing [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=596.24s)]
*  society. And while it's not the same as guns and gasoline, it's had a powerful, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=603.44s)]
*  huge effect on what America is, what America stands for and what America looks [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=610.24s)]
*  like. It's not that it's changed it entirely over, you know, in 50 years is [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=615.1600000000001s)]
*  entirely different. Change is always evolutionary, but it's made a huge change. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=619.12s)]
*  And it was one of the most important periods in our history. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=625.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was a massive, massive time. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=628.6s)]
*  And again, you guys were really the only ones that were covering it in a way that [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  represented how the young people felt. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=635.12s)]
*  And, you know, there's so much of your magazine that's tied into, I mean, I know [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=638.72s)]
*  you walked around here, you saw the Hunter artwork. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  There's so much of, you know, when people think about Rolling Stone, a lot of people [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=646.12s)]
*  think about the early days. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=651.1600000000001s)]
*  You think about Hunter, you know, they think about when you you guys covered his run [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=652.24s)]
*  for sheriff. I mean, that was a that was a giant moment in culture, too, that this [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=657.84s)]
*  fucking madman was running for sheriff. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=664.2s)]
*  And the panic, the moral panic that people had about, oh, my God, what if this guy [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=666.76s)]
*  actually becomes a sheriff and takes up all the streets and locks up all the drug [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  dealers who are actually selling drugs and then all drugs should be free? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  No, he wasn't going to lock up, he was going to lock up bad drug dealers. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  All the drug dealers that were selling drugs. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=683.0s)]
*  If they were selling bad drugs, they were going to put up stocks. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=684.48s)]
*  Yeah. And the main square and you had to be in a stock like, you know, old [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=687.36s)]
*  Williamstown, Massachusetts. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=691.44s)]
*  He wanted to that they saw the streets and it was rip up all the salt and make it in [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=693.68s)]
*  grass, which is good. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=697.64s)]
*  Rename the city from Aspen to Fat City on the theory. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=700.2s)]
*  Hunter came over that would be more difficult for land developers to sell something called [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=703.2s)]
*  Fat City Estates than Aspen Estates. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=708.24s)]
*  You know, and then you couldn't. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=710.68s)]
*  The police had to be unarmed and then there'd be a giant parking lot out of town that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=714.88s)]
*  you could park at and nobody other than residents. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=719.12s)]
*  Residents could not hunter, non-residents couldn't hunter fish. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=721.88s)]
*  But he came close to winning. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=725.6s)]
*  And this was in a very wealthy resort town that was starting to have a hippie [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  population. When we published his his piece about that, and it was the first thing he [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=732.0s)]
*  did for rolling stone, it was called Freak Power in Iraqis or the Battle of Aspen. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=737.6s)]
*  So. It got such serious attention and other press and film crews from New York and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=743.0s)]
*  all, you can hold the hippies are going to try and take over the ski town. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=749.28s)]
*  Well, let's see what happens. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=751.96s)]
*  You know, so much press came in. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=752.9200000000001s)]
*  It just raised the stakes. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=754.88s)]
*  It became quite a serious showdown campaign at this wealthy resort, which they came [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=756.24s)]
*  very close to winning. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=762.16s)]
*  But two things about her just off the bat. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=763.72s)]
*  Hunter became just the DNA of rolling stone. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=768.44s)]
*  I mean, his spirit, his thinking, his sense of adventure, a sense of fun, his [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=771.5600000000001s)]
*  commitment to a better America. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=780.44s)]
*  We're. At the heart of what we did, and these were the same things that I felt. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=783.92s)]
*  And so we we just fell and we became very fast friends. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=791.12s)]
*  I mean, we just locked in almost immediately that we saw something special [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=795.32s)]
*  between us that we did together. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=799.4s)]
*  He could write and I could edit and we were very partners in a very real sense of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=801.76s)]
*  world. There was never after we first met was never a question of whether or not we [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=806.12s)]
*  would work not work with it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=809.76s)]
*  It was always from now on we were together and he was always overseeing that what we [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  were doing at the magazine with ideas, stories and writers. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  And he felt very committed to making the magazine a success. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=819.76s)]
*  And it is his own career. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=822.76s)]
*  Hunter is a and I love Hunter. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=824.68s)]
*  And to this day, miss him terribly, terribly. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=828.8s)]
*  And I wrote my book is about wherever Hunter ends up. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=832.1999999999999s)]
*  I want to go there, too. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=835.8s)]
*  You know, who knows what that'll be. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=837.24s)]
*  But, you know, I mean. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=838.68s)]
*  He just meant that much. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=842.72s)]
*  Yeah. The the documentary, the Gonzo documentary, that was the the first time I ever [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  really got to see you talk about him. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=849.36s)]
*  And, you know, you're kind of the glue that holds a documentary together because [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=851.84s)]
*  you're sort of the rational observer that was there during all the wildest and most [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=856.52s)]
*  mad times. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  He had. I mean, everybody loved to be with Hunter. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't you couldn't get enough of being with Hunter, you know, and [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=868.88s)]
*  including me after having for so much. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=872.84s)]
*  When you're with Hunter, when you were with Hunter, you like felt you're going to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=875.52s)]
*  have more fun and become close to the edge of craziness and danger than you ever [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=878.88s)]
*  work in your life. You know, just getting in the car with Hunter. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=883.32s)]
*  You know, you'd he would always have to do something that's scared that piss out of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=886.4000000000001s)]
*  you. You know, you turns in the middle of a snowbound highway. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=891.08s)]
*  And one night we were driving from Cambridge to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=895.2s)]
*  New Hampshire to visit Norman Mailer for some strange reason. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=901.72s)]
*  We had spent the night in Cambridge and we had taken some acid and we got on the road [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=905.2s)]
*  head full of acid driving up in the middle of the night to me. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=909.8399999999999s)]
*  And it's all mountain roads. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=913.0799999999999s)]
*  And so we go along and then also like I would turn the headlights off. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=915.12s)]
*  And I mean, you have mixed feelings at this point. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=919.4399999999999s)]
*  I do what I've by this time developed this sense I'm safe with Hunter. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=924.1999999999999s)]
*  No matter how crazy as he knows what he's doing all the time, which he did. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=928.5999999999999s)]
*  So on the other hand, he liked the idea of freaking people out. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  So I was go, oh, Hunter, stop it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=936.12s)]
*  You know, like, and it would just make him happier to know that I was freaking out. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=938.76s)]
*  You know, it was partly just to keep him going. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  But then I realized what he was doing is he was looking ahead to Ben's and [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=946.84s)]
*  memorizing the curves ahead so they could turn off the lights, which is risky in [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=951.88s)]
*  itself. But we we got to the mailers. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=956.72s)]
*  We were visiting some colleague of mine, ours, who was staying in my house. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=960.52s)]
*  We had the night before and taking us and made a tape on an old cassette tape of [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  scream like an exorcism, you know, in the house. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, the ghouls going nuts. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=975.1600000000001s)]
*  So we get up there at 7 a.m. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=977.48s)]
*  in the morning and set the tape deck in the kitchen of the house, punch it so it [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=979.0s)]
*  starts with the screaming at top volume and run out the door and don't come back. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=983.48s)]
*  Well, he loved to do that. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=989.36s)]
*  We steal restaurant signs and I mean, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=990.6800000000001s)]
*  there's all sorts of madness and crazy and it's fun, you know, and it was innocent. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  It was like being a kid. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=999.12s)]
*  You know, in part, Hunter was a big kid, but also, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1000.76s)]
*  you know, he he was just a wonderful guy. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1006.5999999999999s)]
*  And of course, the funniest writer ever. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1010.04s)]
*  I enjoyed his copy coming. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1011.76s)]
*  I just laughed my head off of some of the things he'd say. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, unbelievably funny. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1016.92s)]
*  I think the first thing I read was the the Vegas story. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1018.52s)]
*  That was one of the first pieces I ever read of him. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1022.32s)]
*  And I remember thinking like, who the fuck writes like this? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1024.72s)]
*  Like it's it was I don't remember how old I was when I read it, but, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1028.32s)]
*  you know, it was before I think it was before or around the time [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1031.52s)]
*  Johnny Depp played him in the movie. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1036.16s)]
*  No, much before. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1038.32s)]
*  No, when you wrote it, when I read it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1039.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1042.04s)]
*  I think the movie introduced him to him. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1043.16s)]
*  The movie introduced you under. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1046.92s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1048.2s)]
*  I mean, you believe and believe such a person took place, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1049.76s)]
*  but that was a faithful portrayal of an individual. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1053.36s)]
*  And lucky me, he got to be my closest friend for many years. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1057.28s)]
*  And we worked together so closely and all the time for many years. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1062.56s)]
*  And he was Johnny got him really well. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1066.72s)]
*  And I loved him. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1070.92s)]
*  He wrote Vegas in. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1071.76s)]
*  I think it was 1970, I think was about the time 70 or 71. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1074.2s)]
*  No, 70 because 71, 72 was campaign. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1079.2s)]
*  He wrote that it was when he was writing, he started writing in my basement, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1082.56s)]
*  San Francisco, where he was living, staying with us. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1085.8s)]
*  And he just he was on assignment to do something else. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1089.0s)]
*  Some serious thing about the Chicano uprising in East Los Angeles. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1092.16s)]
*  But in the middle of that, Simon had to go to Vegas [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1098.72s)]
*  to cover a motorcycle race for Sports Illustrated. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1102.92s)]
*  And they wanted like a 200 word caption. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1105.4s)]
*  But he never turned that in. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1107.36s)]
*  Instead, started writing this piece about going to Vegas, saying [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1109.08s)]
*  that because we were somewhere on the edge of Barstow and the drugs took hold. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1113.6399999999999s)]
*  And then the image of this red Cadillac, that trunk full of animals, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1117.52s)]
*  uppers, downers, guns, you know, just it madness. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1121.1599999999999s)]
*  But that piece was so strong [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1126.32s)]
*  in two parts is novel, you know, a short novel, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1131.9199999999998s)]
*  a clue became regarded as a classic of American literature [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1136.0s)]
*  today, up with kind like Huck Finn or Catcher in a Rye, stuff like that. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1139.48s)]
*  You know, interesting. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1144.6s)]
*  Another story about the kind of adolescent spirit in all of us, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1145.6399999999999s)]
*  of men who just can't give up being little boys and cherish that [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1151.08s)]
*  wonderful freedom and. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1155.52s)]
*  Fun sense of fun. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1159.0s)]
*  We all that none of us ever ever like to give up, really, you know, still lingers [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  with that. I look in your eyes, I can see it, you know, the mess. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1164.92s)]
*  But I've lost my point. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1168.96s)]
*  It's it it ignited this appetite for chaos [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1171.6s)]
*  and people that were dissatisfied [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1176.48s)]
*  with the narrative that they had been told about the life [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1179.4s)]
*  that you were supposed to live and the way you're supposed to go about things. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1182.6s)]
*  And, you know, and then the 70s was just such a pivotal moment, too, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1186.08s)]
*  because they had legalized they had made [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1190.4s)]
*  all psychedelic drugs illegal. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  And there was this water that was being thrown on this movement. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1195.24s)]
*  And so quickly sort of evaporated so quickly. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1199.16s)]
*  The shift between the 50s and the 60s was kind of paralleled [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1204.2s)]
*  between the shift of the 70s into the 80s. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1208.4s)]
*  At the end, you know, things change. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1211.4s)]
*  I mean, this come. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1213.48s)]
*  That's a complicated. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1215.64s)]
*  Let me just you think what you said about it liberated the chaos. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1217.2s)]
*  And they ignited an appetite for chaos. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1220.6s)]
*  Exactly. That it was accepted that you didn't have to [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  that you could live loosely or openly or you didn't have to obey all this rules. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1228.08s)]
*  That's what that's what Dylan was about, too. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1232.8s)]
*  You know, about the complexity of life and all things going on in your head. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1235.36s)]
*  And, you know, the two great Dylan albums bringing all back home [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1238.6799999999998s)]
*  and I was just you want to about chaos. But. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1242.7199999999998s)]
*  At the end of the 70s, I mean, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1247.52s)]
*  the 80s was the era of Reagan. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1250.44s)]
*  I mean, we have Reagan leading the country. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1252.16s)]
*  Things change. You know, the mood is different. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1254.76s)]
*  The values of society seem different in the 70s. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1257.92s)]
*  We had either a full scale rebellion going on against Nixon, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1261.92s)]
*  you know, which was an exciting time to be alive and seen the watergate [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1265.28s)]
*  hearings and just those triumphs and stuff. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1268.72s)]
*  And then Carter, as the end of the 70s, you know, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1271.2s)]
*  the first real rock and roll president [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1274.88s)]
*  and who Hunter had a great love of and who [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1277.72s)]
*  Carter loved him, you know, and Carter loved Dylan and [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1282.64s)]
*  was of that spirit. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a great there's a great moment in the documentary where [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1288.68s)]
*  it talks about Hunter being at Carter's speech [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1292.68s)]
*  and going back to get his tape recorder and recognizing that this is [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1296.04s)]
*  this is a very unusual moment. This guy's different. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1301.0s)]
*  He was going up to Carter's talking about [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1304.64s)]
*  the quality of justice. Yeah. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1307.72s)]
*  You know, and talking about his spiritual ideas that he got from [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1309.24s)]
*  Reinhold Niebuhr, if I pronounce that correctly, and quoting Dylan and. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1312.6000000000001s)]
*  Very unusual for politicians. Yeah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1319.16s)]
*  And it was an accident. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1321.2s)]
*  Really, it looked like Teddy Kennedy was going to run for president [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1322.1200000000001s)]
*  then to be the nominee. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1326.08s)]
*  So we have Hunter was following Teddy around and Teddy had to go to Georgia [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1327.04s)]
*  to be a guest of honor at the law at the law school there for Law Day. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  And Carter spoke and gave this remarkable thing. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1335.0s)]
*  You don't hear people, politicians talk like that then anyway, you didn't. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1338.52s)]
*  And Hunter was knocked out. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1342.36s)]
*  And we kind of got aboard the. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1344.96s)]
*  Carter campaign wrote about Hunter almost, you know, kind of. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1349.76s)]
*  We became a part of it in a way. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1355.28s)]
*  And between Hunter's coverage of the McGovern campaign [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1357.44s)]
*  and the Carter campaign, it particularly McGovern [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1361.36s)]
*  had put Rolling Stone on the map in a way. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1364.48s)]
*  Well, although we'd done big stories and broken things before, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1367.04s)]
*  the idea that we were the rock and roll magazine was covering national politics. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1371.2s)]
*  And furthermore, the guy doing it was best known for covering motorcycle gangs. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1375.12s)]
*  You know, and plus sweating all the time because he's [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1379.56s)]
*  boozing and that riveted everybody. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1383.32s)]
*  And it brought real attention to us because Hunter wrote the best coverage [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1386.8799999999999s)]
*  of the campaign, the best stuff about the Kennedy's, the best about the political [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1390.08s)]
*  strategy and also rolling stones part of the annual big national story [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1393.36s)]
*  competing with the New York Times. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1398.48s)]
*  Everybody else had on and beat them all. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1399.84s)]
*  We were better than the rest of them. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1401.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, that was that was where it really sort of [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1405.48s)]
*  captured the way young people were actually feeling [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1410.0s)]
*  versus the way it was being described. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1414.52s)]
*  What's more than I think I go with the water. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1416.6799999999998s)]
*  OK. I mean, that was, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1419.64s)]
*  you know, what what your magazine had covered and what he had covered [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1429.08s)]
*  with fear and loathing on the campaign trail. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1432.2s)]
*  It was the way young people were feeling about it versus the way it was being [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1434.72s)]
*  represented on television and in newspapers. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1438.48s)]
*  And it was people finally had a real voice that spoke to them. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1441.68s)]
*  And it really resonated with people. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1448.0s)]
*  Yeah, because to see it through Hunter's eyes. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1449.48s)]
*  Also, it was the first time that 18 year olds were allowed to vote was in 1972. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1451.6000000000001s)]
*  And so that made it extra interesting to young people. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1456.68s)]
*  And also there was a war in Vietnam as a big background. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1459.28s)]
*  I mean, that was, you know, that makes everything [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1462.48s)]
*  stand out, a high relief. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1465.96s)]
*  But also, Hunter was extremely they were pieces. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1468.6000000000001s)]
*  You don't have to know anything about politics to read those pieces. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1472.3600000000001s)]
*  They were so funny. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1474.76s)]
*  I mean, these things is coming up with a Senator Muskie [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1475.84s)]
*  was shooting a big game on the campaign. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1479.56s)]
*  I mean, really, people come up to you say, is it true about the game? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1481.72s)]
*  Come on. You know, you became being a drug from the pineal gland of some [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1486.2s)]
*  exotic South African animal that enables you to stand still without making [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1490.9199999999998s)]
*  a movement. But your your function of being still for 24 hours. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1495.8s)]
*  And Muskie was having a problem with this drug. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1500.04s)]
*  I mean, and people ask me, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1502.72s)]
*  100 would give away his credentials to some wild ass hippie [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1504.36s)]
*  didn't bribe them on the campaign. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1507.6s)]
*  He says, is it pranks? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1509.84s)]
*  I mean, you just couldn't have asked for anything better. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1511.84s)]
*  And as I say, that year of the campaign coverage, I just I just had the best time. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1514.24s)]
*  Occasionally, I go out and meet him on the campaign trail. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1518.96s)]
*  The late nights were hysterical, but the filing of the copy [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1521.56s)]
*  when he'd write this stuff and you just couldn't understand [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1525.56s)]
*  where the hell did this guy come from? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1530.84s)]
*  What did how did McGovern describe his book? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1531.52s)]
*  He said it was the most accurate and least factual. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1533.64s)]
*  Something like that. Yeah. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1536.96s)]
*  Which was a great way to put it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1540.0s)]
*  It's true. I mean, you know, in the end, you began to [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1542.52s)]
*  but it became so important to everybody in them. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1547.2s)]
*  Campaign because then it was also as it was writing [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1550.32s)]
*  the most accurate stuff about where the campaign stood and the mood [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1552.84s)]
*  inside the campaign. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1556.44s)]
*  So he was the leitmotif for the candidate himself. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1557.24s)]
*  McGovern, who called them the sheriff all the time. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1560.84s)]
*  And everybody working on that came some campaign who became friends over the years. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1563.16s)]
*  I mean, it's really the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1571.04s)]
*  the music kind of that went along with that very special campaign [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1575.04s)]
*  because McGovern was a very special man, a very really human, good man. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1578.68s)]
*  And of course, and heavily defeated. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1584.16s)]
*  I mean, there was a lot of sourness. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1588.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, if you think it was funky when Trump got elected, it was funky. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1590.68s)]
*  I mean, it was just doom. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1594.8400000000001s)]
*  What do you think would have happened if McGovern's vice president [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1597.0s)]
*  hadn't gone through shock treatments and that hadn't been exposed? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1600.0400000000002s)]
*  And do you think he could have won? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1603.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. No. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1605.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't just the Eagleton thing. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1607.2s)]
*  And that was an example of things being done kind of half fast. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1610.6799999999998s)]
*  But remember, there's nominating convention. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1614.48s)]
*  He didn't get nominated to like two or three in the morning. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  So and the thing is, you lose your whole prime time audience, you know. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1619.24s)]
*  You've lost this shot at it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1623.6399999999999s)]
*  And that level of. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1625.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, haphazardness was probably affected in all levels of the campaign. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1629.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, and. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1634.08s)]
*  My government is just too a little ahead of the times, a little too radical. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1636.84s)]
*  Nixon was a formidable political strategist. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1641.08s)]
*  You know, they had boxed McGovern in. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1645.08s)]
*  I mean, I don't think he could have overcome that Nixon juggernaut [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1646.9599999999998s)]
*  and the opinion juggernaut. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1650.04s)]
*  Well, one of the fascinating things about Hunter's coverage [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1652.3999999999999s)]
*  was the fact that he would mix in fiction like the Ibogaine thing, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1654.9199999999998s)]
*  but he would mix in fiction with reality without a wink. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1660.0s)]
*  Like it was very hard for some people to understand. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1666.0s)]
*  You know, but it was so good. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1670.3999999999999s)]
*  During Watergate, Hunter. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1672.28s)]
*  We were writing about that Watergate trials or hearings or something at that. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1675.56s)]
*  And he was saying at midnight, a vampire jumps, you know, no. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1679.3999999999999s)]
*  A vampire with wart strings coming from the nose leaps from the West balcony. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1686.6399999999999s)]
*  Werewolf. Yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1691.84s)]
*  Leaps in the West balcony of the White House. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1693.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, roaming the grounds looking for chows to eat, you know, for [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1695.72s)]
*  and it's the spirit of Nixon, then it's peering outside Martha Mitchell's bed. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1699.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's that's the best stuff. Yeah. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1703.48s)]
*  I mean, when you get that, you just kind of crack up. Yeah. And. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1706.72s)]
*  You know, it was it was a great run. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1712.28s)]
*  It was a great run, as I say, you know, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1715.12s)]
*  the spirit of Hunter lives at Rolling Stone. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1717.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's just inextricably tied to Rolling Stone. Yeah. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1720.52s)]
*  I mean, that's what I think of Rolling Stone. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1724.16s)]
*  I think of Hunter. I really do, especially the early days. Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1726.6000000000001s)]
*  And then at the same with Annie, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1730.44s)]
*  Lee was another incredibly strong [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  personality turned out to be another genius, you know, kind of world class. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1736.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, Annie, who lives today is considered the world's greatest [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1740.4s)]
*  living portrait photographer. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1743.96s)]
*  These days, she was last several years. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1745.92s)]
*  She sought a portrait of the Queen of England a couple of times as her official royal. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1747.88s)]
*  So Annie goes from our loft in San Francisco and the Rolling Stones tours [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1752.2s)]
*  and so forth, running around the Almond brothers or Hunter, whatever, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1757.3600000000001s)]

*  But again, she brought to the magazine identity that along with hunters [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1765.0800000000002s)]
*  and, you know, a bunch of kind of. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1770.0s)]
*  Hard charging newspaper guys that I had hired from [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1773.1200000000001s)]
*  three different newspapers were the kind of backbone. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1777.6399999999999s)]
*  Tom Wolf, Annie Hunter, this newspaper and these [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1782.32s)]
*  and a couple of college kids, I hired as editors. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1785.8799999999999s)]
*  And we had a rock and sock them ten years there in San Francisco [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1789.92s)]
*  before moving New York and did things like the Patty Hearst kidnapping, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1794.72s)]
*  the John Lennon interviews, the Silkwood case, you know, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1799.96s)]

*  narcotics squads that were already in, you know, investigate them. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1808.2s)]
*  And a bunch of other stuff. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1813.32s)]
*  Which formed Rolling Stone and Hunter. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1816.68s)]
*  Was not that it was a spiritual ringleader of it. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1821.2s)]
*  Everybody wanted to be like Hunter. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1824.6s)]
*  Everybody wanted to write important stuff, not nobody imitated him. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1826.3999999999999s)]
*  Everybody knew better than that. But to be as good a writer, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1829.76s)]
*  to be as good as a reporter, to do meaningful, important stuff like that. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1833.76s)]
*  And that that that that was the formation. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1837.56s)]
*  Foundational spirit of Rolling Stone was that stuff. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1841.72s)]
*  How hard was it for you to watch the wheels come off on him? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1845.16s)]
*  It was tough. You know, I mean. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1850.16s)]
*  After the Watergate, I kept we kept trying to work together, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1854.48s)]
*  but I'd give him assignment after assignment and he didn't wouldn't do it. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1858.92s)]
*  Or a couple like he went to Zaire to look at the Ali fight there. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1862.08s)]
*  The rumble and jumbles Ali and Foreman, I think. Yes. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1866.96s)]
*  And didn't go to the fight. Yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1870.08s)]
*  Spent the afternoon lollygagging in the pool. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1872.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, it was because he thought that it was a mismatch. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1875.12s)]
*  Is that what the idea was? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1877.48s)]
*  I don't I think there's two things. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1879.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think that. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1880.84s)]
*  You'd have to what do you write about a prize fight? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1884.1999999999998s)]
*  When there's 50 other writers there, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1890.24s)]
*  you know, everybody's got every angle covered. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1891.84s)]
*  But on the other hand, he had access to Ali Ali. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1893.76s)]
*  And he were both hometown Louisville boys. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1897.8s)]
*  They're homies that they didn't know each other. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1900.08s)]
*  But also we were really close with Bob Aram, who was I mean, he could have gotten it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1902.12s)]
*  But I I just think he got frightened of it. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1906.4399999999998s)]
*  It got lazy. Too much drugs. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1909.36s)]
*  Those things. And, you know, since we worked here less, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1912.1999999999998s)]
*  it was so less of me coming to New York, we always get together. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1916.9599999999998s)]
*  I'd always see him in Aspen, but. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1920.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, just became frustrating, you know, and you'd sit down and talk [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1923.68s)]
*  and have a big long session all night about what we'll do next. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1927.0800000000002s)]
*  And this and plan and come up with ideas and laugh our heads about them. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1930.92s)]
*  And I'm going to go. But then it wouldn't happen. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1934.0s)]
*  You know, I go back and he just couldn't follow up. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1936.0800000000002s)]
*  But finally, I think in the 90s. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1938.48s)]
*  He did two of the best pieces he ever did for us out of the blue. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1942.8400000000001s)]
*  One was called Fear and Loathing and Elko, which he started to write [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1947.12s)]
*  because there's a snowstorm in Aspen, which shut down Aspen for about 10 or 12 days, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1952.08s)]
*  during which time he couldn't get his hands on the cocaine. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1958.56s)]
*  And. And he started to write this really beautiful piece, you know, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1962.1599999999999s)]
*  and it was hysterical, it was like very dark compared to Vegas. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1968.28s)]
*  But it was like fear and the other way he runs into Judge Clarence Thomas [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1973.4s)]
*  in the middle of the desert, who just had a car accident. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1977.92s)]
*  And Judge Thomas. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1980.72s)]
*  Is running a whorehouse in Elko, Nevada, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1983.4s)]
*  so he goes so and it goes from there. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1986.8799999999999s)]
*  And it was, again, hysterical, like old times. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1989.52s)]
*  That's great. Then you'd find one last piece about Roxanne Pulitzer, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1992.76s)]
*  which was beautiful, beautiful piece. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1996.68s)]
*  So funny. And it was really, you know, it was about rich people [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=1999.88s)]
*  living in Palm Beach taking tons of blow. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2004.0400000000002s)]
*  And blow was, you know, the right assignment for Hunter. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2007.64s)]
*  It was the same really wasn't so much about the Pulitzer cases. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2011.6000000000001s)]
*  It was about what blow does to people, you know, and this is something he knew about. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2015.4s)]
*  Anybody was painful. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2020.96s)]
*  And, you know, I had to talk with Hunter, of course, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2022.16s)]
*  is in my book about. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2025.84s)]
*  Trying to get him to go to rehab, but willing to pay for it, do whatever necessary. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2028.04s)]
*  I said, you know, I appreciate he wouldn't get angry at me because I appreciate it. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2032.0s)]
*  I know what you're trying to do here, but I thought about it, but [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2035.0s)]
*  I'm I'm a drug addict, you know, an alcoholic, and that's what it's going to be. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2038.6399999999999s)]
*  And and and frankly, if I didn't take drugs, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2042.24s)]
*  I would probably have been an accountant, you know, that's my of the mind of an account. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2045.8s)]
*  But he remained lifelong friends. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2051.0s)]
*  You know, it was a very sad day when he died and very upsetting and, you know, but. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2053.28s)]
*  You know, I he always knew I had his back and vice versa. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2061.5600000000004s)]
*  He had mine. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2064.84s)]
*  Oftentimes, when someone becomes a cultural icon like that, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2067.44s)]
*  like he was, he become kind of a captive to what your audience thinks you are. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2071.52s)]
*  This exactly happens to Hunter. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2078.48s)]
*  When we were covering the 72 campaign, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2082.08s)]
*  he was a little bit of a celebrity on that campaign among the other reporters on a campaign. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2085.48s)]
*  I mean, you're going, you know, all the establishment, you know, major Washington [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2090.56s)]
*  White House correspondents and campaign at the time or anything. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2096.3199999999997s)]
*  And they were going, oh, there's Hunter and maybe sometimes to me, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2099.72s)]
*  there's honey, it's the real deal from Rolling Stone, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2102.72s)]
*  you know, because everybody read Rolling Stone at that point. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2105.04s)]
*  And he's the real. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2106.96s)]
*  But his behavior and his charm was such it just everybody wanted to hang around with him. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2107.84s)]
*  And it made him difficult for him to sometimes try. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2112.6000000000004s)]
*  He had to get away. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2114.76s)]
*  You know, because of my stuff. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2115.88s)]
*  But I go out there and everybody's hanging out. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2116.92s)]
*  I mean, the most distinguished people, you know, are going, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2119.52s)]
*  why don't you hang around with drug addict and a rock and roll editor? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2122.2000000000003s)]
*  But that was a bit of annoyance, but it was fine. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2126.1200000000003s)]
*  But then it just became too much. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2130.44s)]
*  I mean, and then there was the Gary Trudeau Doonesbury cartoon. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2132.92s)]
*  Yeah. Strip. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2136.68s)]
*  In which he took one of Hunter's best characters, Raoul Duke, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2138.56s)]
*  whom was the original author of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2143.6s)]
*  He never said it by Hunter, he said it by Raoul Duke. Right. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2148.48s)]
*  And made a cartoon figure out of the character. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2151.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, it was of this outrage. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2155.68s)]
*  He took he took Hunter himself and made him a cartoon character. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2157.7599999999998s)]
*  And it was really diminishment of his talent. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2163.0s)]
*  Did he ever talk to Gary about that? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2166.44s)]
*  I think in a kind of a ho ho way, not in any. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2169.12s)]
*  I think Hunter was. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2172.52s)]
*  I told him he could and should sue and stop it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2174.76s)]
*  I mean, I thought it was clearly a. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2178.52s)]
*  Appropriation of his intellectual property, right? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2181.6800000000003s)]
*  Being used to whole hog by somebody else. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2184.6800000000003s)]
*  And I thought he should stop because I just think it's bad for him. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2186.76s)]
*  You know, that created more celebrity than anything is. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2189.64s)]
*  He was Uncle Duke, the crazy guy, you know, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2193.12s)]
*  not the serious writer, but the crazy goofball. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2195.44s)]
*  How did that get started and why did he get started? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2199.32s)]
*  The crazy booth? Yeah. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2201.8s)]
*  But why did why did Gary write about it that way? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2203.28s)]
*  I don't know. Surprised to me. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2205.92s)]
*  I mean, I guess, you know, Hunter was a [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2207.44s)]
*  became a figure of mythology, you know, in a way in during his lifetime. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2211.0400000000004s)]
*  You know, he was an icon to young people and still is [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2215.84s)]
*  the icon to young people today. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2219.28s)]
*  And I guess it works so well for Gary, he would never stop. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2222.04s)]
*  You know, he didn't stop. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2225.68s)]
*  And I think it it Hunter was afraid to stop it. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  He was afraid to stop it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2231.8s)]
*  I think he felt if he was the guy who [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2233.0s)]
*  ordered Gary to cease and desist, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2235.96s)]
*  he would be really disliked for having stepped in [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2239.44s)]
*  and squished a really popular cartoon character. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2242.88s)]
*  And I think also was hundreds of those that enchanted him. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2245.32s)]
*  Hunter is in another extent enchanted by the idea of [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2249.64s)]
*  Hunter himself as a cartoon character. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2254.12s)]
*  I mean, Gary used to put me in that cartoon strip [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2255.8399999999997s)]
*  in relation to Donder and not relation for doing different things. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2258.92s)]
*  And while there's always a little bit of put down involved in it, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2261.96s)]
*  you know, nonetheless, it's like totally enjoyable and fun [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2265.7599999999998s)]
*  to pick up the Sunday papers, remembers papers. Yeah. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2269.96s)]
*  And, you know, there's 12 four color panels near the character. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2273.48s)]
*  You know, wow, that's totally cool. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2276.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, Doonesbury was also the sort of counterculture comic strip. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2278.76s)]
*  It was a very original comic strip in that regard. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2283.28s)]
*  I and and Gary, who was a friend of mine, is a friend of mine. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2286.2000000000003s)]
*  And I liked his character comic strip. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2290.44s)]
*  I thought he's great at that and did an important service [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  in a certain sense for that era by bringing [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2296.0400000000004s)]
*  the so-called counterculture beatnik, what do you want to call that? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2299.76s)]
*  To a more serious audience and explained it in a way [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2303.88s)]
*  that was kind of wholesome and funny without being dangerous. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2307.52s)]
*  You know, Gary was a divinity major at Yale and kind of square [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2311.84s)]
*  and married Jane Polly. I mean, it could be square. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2316.6s)]
*  And I liked it. But the. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2319.08s)]
*  He he he bought that message to. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2322.12s)]
*  The adult audience well. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2326.92s)]
*  And that so that had a big effect on Hunter, that character. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2329.96s)]
*  I think it did. It had a it was part of a corrosive effect. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2334.4s)]
*  I think there's a bunch of things. Corrosive. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2337.88s)]
*  There was drugs and drink, which after a while, you just take over you. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2340.12s)]
*  Yeah. And the fame. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2344.68s)]
*  And the fame within that was this particular type of fame of the comic strip. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2348.84s)]
*  And. The fact that everywhere he go, people surrounded him. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2356.2s)]
*  If he, you know, if you go into it, you know, TV, everything, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2362.56s)]
*  he just surrounded by groupies all the time. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2366.16s)]
*  And it's just where did he have the opportunity to work on? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2368.52s)]
*  It was the drugs more than any single thing. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2371.68s)]
*  Well, I think the fame is a drug. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2374.2799999999997s)]
*  Fame is a drug. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2376.3999999999996s)]
*  It's it's also a drug that most people don't understand. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2377.7599999999998s)]
*  They've never experienced. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2381.3999999999996s)]
*  So there's not like a blueprint. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2383.3199999999997s)]
*  There's not a road map of how to navigate this correctly. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2386.24s)]
*  So and when you deal with fame on the level that Hunter Hunter was dealing with, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2389.7599999999998s)]
*  you're dealing with this. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2394.56s)]
*  He was a cultural icon as well as being a very prominent and well known person. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2396.2799999999997s)]
*  So there's expectations for his behavior, expectations. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2403.0s)]
*  And and people look to him like, oh, Hunter's here. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2406.72s)]
*  It's going to get crazy. Yeah. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2409.6s)]
*  So Hunter's here. We're going to take drugs. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2411.52s)]
*  We're going to get crazy. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2413.72s)]
*  So Hunter's a generous was a generous person and felt obligated to all these people. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2414.7599999999998s)]
*  And, you know, was not immune to taking drugs. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2419.88s)]
*  You know, so anybody show up, but you're people want to hang around him. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2422.6000000000004s)]
*  And and he would try and fulfill their expectations. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2427.2400000000002s)]
*  Our expectations were always that of fans or group. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2429.6800000000003s)]
*  He's always saying, oh, I want to be with Hunter because he's a great writer. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2432.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'd like to learn, you know, his feet where he comes up with these, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2434.96s)]
*  you know, like other writers are treated. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2438.0400000000004s)]
*  There's always the whole whole thing. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2439.84s)]
*  And it it just ate up his time. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2441.52s)]
*  And also you start to play that audience. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2446.76s)]
*  You know, you start to to you're getting approval. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2449.6s)]
*  You know, you you know, bound people. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2453.88s)]
*  You like to make them laugh. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2456.52s)]
*  You like to entertain. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2457.7599999999998s)]
*  You like to, you know, satisfy them. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2458.92s)]
*  And then Hunter just got swept up in that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2461.84s)]
*  It happens to so many famous people. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2464.64s)]
*  I mean, all your worst stuff gets reinforced. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2467.68s)]
*  You know, all and your ego gets reinforced. Yeah. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2469.84s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, it happened to Sam Kinnison, too. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2473.96s)]
*  Is that and I think drugs there, too. Yeah. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2476.56s)]
*  Oh, 100 percent. Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2479.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's kind of in the same way he became that guy [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2480.72s)]
*  that everybody expected to be wild and out of control. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2483.44s)]
*  And with Kinnison, he just kind of stopped writing. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2487.04s)]
*  You know, Belushi, yeah, who is a big friend of mine and hunters [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2490.04s)]
*  and a number of armies of friends, but I was very close with John. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2494.36s)]
*  And it's the same thing. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2497.68s)]
*  You know, it just too much drugs. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2499.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I've got seen a book I was when I was coming to [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2502.6s)]
*  John used to come out flat to stay with me in San Francisco [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2506.36s)]
*  every weekend after Saturday night live, come out, decompress [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2510.04s)]
*  for a few days, go back to San Francisco. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2512.88s)]
*  So when I go back to New York, he always Johnny John Belushi. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2514.4s)]
*  OK. And he and he was in the hospital one time [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2518.68s)]
*  and his leg was up in a slinging assisted. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2523.84s)]
*  I come by as soon as I land. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2525.72s)]
*  He had just done a samurai skit and fallen off the stage at Saturday Night Live [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2527.12s)]
*  and broke his leg. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2531.16s)]
*  And I go visit my husband, of course, he reaches up into his thing, into the cast [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2533.68s)]
*  and inside the cast, he's brought out of Paul Coke. So. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2538.16s)]
*  You know, it's gone too far. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2543.68s)]
*  And I thought cocaine in the end, and I again say so in this book, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2547.04s)]
*  and was a real waste of time and real destructive. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2552.56s)]
*  I mean, I embrace LSD. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2555.72s)]
*  Rolling Stone was on a crusade for the legalization, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2557.6s)]
*  decriminalization of pot for the first of the beginning, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2561.28s)]
*  going at narcotics squads and drug laws and on army just with so much space [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2565.1600000000003s)]
*  to this hideous laws that locked up innocent young people, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2569.88s)]
*  particularly black people for the crime of smoking pot, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2574.52s)]
*  a victimless crime of smoking pot, which was [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2579.0800000000004s)]
*  so much less dangerous than drinking. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2585.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. But people go to jail for years. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2587.2000000000003s)]
*  They'd be the souls. In any case, we advocate for that. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2590.08s)]
*  You know, I think LSE is a good drug for lots of people [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2594.92s)]
*  and properly used, but cocaine and speed are just a kind of waste of time. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2598.7999999999997s)]
*  You don't really get much done. You end up going around in circles. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2603.84s)]
*  And I say, if I could take it back, I would take back all that cocaine. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2607.08s)]
*  I also quote Jimmy Buffett in the book is another good friend [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2611.7599999999998s)]
*  who I thought had the best line about saying [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2616.32s)]
*  there is nothing worth talking about after two o'clock in the morning. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2619.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2625.28s)]
*  So, I mean, waste of time and waste of, you know, opportunities [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2627.8s)]
*  to have wonderful set. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2632.32s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2634.36s)]
*  Yeah, I've never fucked around with coke. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2636.32s)]
*  No, it's not too late. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2638.36s)]
*  You could throw your life away, Joe. Come on. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2640.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, I was very fortunate that when I was in high school, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2643.44s)]
*  Rogan deteriorated over the years. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2645.52s)]
*  He went that way with Hunter. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2647.96s)]
*  Some of my favorite people did a lot of coke. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2650.28s)]
*  Yeah. Richard Pryor, the shirt I'm wearing. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2652.04s)]
*  Kinnison, I mean, so many of them, they were they were into coke. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2655.0s)]
*  But I was very fortunate that when I was in high school, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2659.4s)]
*  a good friend of mine, his cousin was selling coke. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2662.96s)]
*  And I watched him deteriorate rapidly. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2665.92s)]
*  He was doing coke every day. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2668.48s)]
*  He was selling it. And him and his girlfriend, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2669.6s)]
*  just they had an attic apartment and they would hide in this apartment. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2671.72s)]
*  I went to visit him once and it was like I'd known him before. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2674.88s)]
*  He did coke and then I knew him afterwards. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2678.48s)]
*  And it was like a person who had been bit by a vampire. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2680.36s)]
*  He'd become a different person. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2682.7200000000003s)]
*  He lost all this weight and just seemed creepy. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2684.48s)]
*  And that's the description of like methamphetamines. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2687.88s)]
*  Yeah, same kind of thing. It's stimulants. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2690.84s)]
*  There's something about stimulants that they they grab a hold of you. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2693.2400000000002s)]
*  They become physically addictive, unlike marijuana, which, I mean, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2697.6s)]
*  I guess you'd be psychologically addictive, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2700.28s)]
*  but there's the physical addiction part of it was very bizarre to see. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2702.08s)]
*  And it affected other people that I was around to at the time. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2706.72s)]
*  And at that time, I was very straight laced. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2709.92s)]
*  I didn't do any drugs or partying or anything. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2712.68s)]
*  And I remember thinking that is something I never, never want to be a part of. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2715.7999999999997s)]
*  Lucky you. I mean, it damaged tons of people in rock and roll community. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2720.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And I think it set a lot of things. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2724.84s)]
*  Way off track, you know. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2729.24s)]
*  Well, it gives you confidence and reinforces bad ideas. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2730.76s)]
*  Which I think the last thing a super popular person wants is confidence. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2735.4s)]
*  That's the last thing you need in your life. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  You got plenty of that. That's why you're there. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2742.5200000000004s)]
*  You don't want to reinforce that and feed that demon, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2744.88s)]
*  which is one of the things that I think is very powerful about psychedelics [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2747.88s)]
*  and about marijuana, because it erodes all of these cultural expectations [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2751.7200000000003s)]
*  and all these thoughts of who you are and what you are and all these [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2756.48s)]
*  egocentric ideas. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2761.36s)]
*  And it leaves you with this like sense of like just vulnerability. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2762.96s)]
*  And that's what marijuana does. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2767.92s)]
*  It gives you this vulnerability and connection and just it gives you what you need. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2769.4s)]
*  Marijuana and appreciation and sensitivity. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2775.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, slows you down. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2778.32s)]
*  It's great for listening to music. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2780.96s)]
*  I used to be a big skier and I loved skiing on. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2783.0400000000004s)]
*  You know, be like at 10 o'clock morning is a time to [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2786.88s)]
*  it's time to open the office yet, you know. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2789.92s)]
*  And other than that, I other than I can't, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2793.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, if I if I smoke a joint and I start coughing and I got really raspy [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2797.16s)]
*  throat and the inedibles last so long, you know, that [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2802.8399999999997s)]
*  you've got to it's it's almost like, you know, and then I get tired, you know, so. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2807.48s)]
*  But naked speed and cocaine, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2814.08s)]
*  the last thing you need when you got a coke is money, right? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2817.12s)]
*  You know, because then it's non. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2820.56s)]
*  Then you're never going to stop. Right. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2822.28s)]
*  And that's what happened to these all these ruin. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2824.28s)]
*  Slystone, Ike Turner, you know, I did. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2826.88s)]
*  It's cause you still in Nash kind of fell apart. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2830.0s)]
*  But on the other hand, it gave us, you know, Fleetwood Mac, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2832.2400000000002s)]
*  that great record of theirs room was it rumors or [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2835.48s)]
*  and it gave us Hotel California, which is a great record. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2840.12s)]

*  And, you know. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2847.08s)]
*  But any exile of Main Street? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2850.56s)]
*  Well, it gave it gave people, you know, the chaos of it all, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2853.0s)]
*  the the wildness of it all gave people a lot of art. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2857.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's like many things are able to hunter, too. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2860.44s)]
*  Yeah. But after a while, it takes you over. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2863.52s)]
*  You can't sustain a drug start taking you. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2866.3199999999997s)]
*  It's kind of like a management issue. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2869.56s)]
*  Like, how do you manage that force? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2871.88s)]
*  An addiction to an addiction. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2874.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And also, again, no real blueprint to how to do it correctly, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2876.2000000000003s)]
*  especially when you do. You know, people kind of [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2880.8s)]
*  mean that people certainly get out of control with drinking. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2883.48s)]
*  But there's sort of a blueprint for how to handle drinking. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2886.28s)]
*  Entire structure around the country, AA. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2890.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Devoted to that with thousands of people rolled. Yeah. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2892.7200000000003s)]
*  But alcohol is I mean, like, I know what the numbers, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2896.44s)]
*  but I thought it was in the millions of people who die of cirrhosis of the liver. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2899.12s)]
*  Yeah. Every year. It's a lot. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2903.4s)]
*  A lot. And directly caused by drinking. Yeah. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2905.4s)]
*  Have you heard of one person? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2908.24s)]
*  Who's ever died from marijuana? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2911.0s)]
*  No, it's nontoxic. Yeah. It doesn't kill you. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2913.12s)]
*  It doesn't. You know, I mean, there might be some rare person [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2915.52s)]
*  that has an allergy to it and want to eliminate possibility. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2919.0s)]
*  But it's and there's also there's a real risk of schizophrenic breaks. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2922.2s)]
*  You know, Alex Berenson, who wrote for The New York Times, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2926.64s)]
*  wrote a book called Tell Your Children. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2929.48s)]
*  And it's basically about the risks [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2931.44s)]
*  that people that have that have a tendency towards schizophrenia, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2935.36s)]
*  where marijuana can push them over the edge. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2938.52s)]
*  And I've seen that. That absolutely. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2940.64s)]
*  I mean, I think this is I mean, I decided in my book, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2942.88s)]
*  like a rolling stone available for sale to be on. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2946.92s)]
*  Is it out now? It is out now. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2950.52s)]
*  It's on the bestseller list. Congratulations. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2952.16s)]
*  I just thought in my book that to be honest about drugs, that. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2955.08s)]
*  I could the tendency of people who write about this era, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2961.4s)]
*  young people in general, to kind of leave the drugs part out of it [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2965.2s)]
*  or maybe acknowledge it slightly or acknowledge inhaling or something. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2968.88s)]
*  But it would be dishonest to tell the story of this generation [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2972.6s)]
*  without telling the story of drugs and that amount of use that took place [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2976.56s)]
*  in the 20s with the jazz age. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2980.84s)]
*  I mean, it was bootleg gin all the time. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2983.16s)]
*  Yeah, it was talked about gin soaked age and not unequivalent [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2984.8s)]
*  to what we're in now. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2989.32s)]
*  The it was age, you know, a prosperous period and. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2990.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, technology, technology, you know, with the invention [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2996.04s)]
*  of the radio and automobile and the fashion. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=2998.76s)]
*  Anyway, but to be honest about drugs, you have to honestly say pot's cool. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3003.48s)]
*  That's good. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3009.44s)]
*  What the real role of acid was come to really understand denounce cocaine. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3010.56s)]
*  But I told the stories of it as if this is the way we live, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3015.48s)]
*  because it was the way we live. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3018.44s)]
*  And I would be lying to it, widewash it. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3019.8799999999997s)]
*  And I'd be lying to say that coke was a use was a terrible drug. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3023.08s)]
*  And I'd be lying to say LSD was anything but super positive for me [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3026.3199999999997s)]
*  and share share those lessons with people. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3030.52s)]
*  I was asked once by the head of the Partnership for Drug Free America, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3033.92s)]
*  which was then the leading anti drug thing in the country. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3040.48s)]
*  They were famous for their commercial. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3044.92s)]
*  This is your brain on drugs. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3046.24s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the fried the egg in the pan frying. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3047.44s)]

*  Big public relations, public service campaign. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3055.68s)]
*  And I asked this guy for some advice. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3058.56s)]
*  So he said, I'll give you advice, but you have to look at our commercials [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3061.2s)]
*  and give us a critique. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3065.6s)]
*  So I said, OK, I'll do that. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3067.3199999999997s)]
*  So I look at those commercials, I go back to the peak. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3068.6s)]
*  It's just the problem with commercials is which is, you know, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3070.3999999999996s)]
*  how these athletes are going out there and winning varsity championships. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3073.3599999999997s)]
*  And meanwhile, the drug kids are in a corner in a hallway smoking. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3076.24s)]
*  It's the drug kids look like they're having the most fun. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3079.68s)]
*  Yeah. You know, you're not scaring. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3082.44s)]

*  But I thought I said, your problem with partners, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3092.04s)]
*  just tell us you can't tell the truth about pot. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3096.24s)]
*  And so you can tell the truth. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3098.7599999999998s)]
*  Nobody's going to trust you about anything else. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3100.3599999999997s)]
*  The problem with the war on drugs is it's been fought by people who not on drugs. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3102.7599999999998s)]
*  They don't understand what they're talking about. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3107.7999999999997s)]
*  Like this is your brain on drugs and you showing eggs. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3109.8399999999997s)]
*  That's the last thing you should ever show to someone who's hungry. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3114.2s)]
*  You know, that was the stand up comedy bit that so many people had. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3117.4s)]
*  Bill Hicks had a great bit about it. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3120.7200000000003s)]
*  Like you got any hash browns? Like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3122.6400000000003s)]

*  You buy drugs, you support terrorism. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3154.56s)]
*  And that's the that's the whole commercial. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3155.88s)]
*  Is this guy just saying this one thing with no fact means [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3157.96s)]
*  a clear thing that you could get away with sort of before the Internet? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3161.12s)]
*  You know, it's like a narrative they were trying to push. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3164.0s)]

*  And then 2000, I think, or we were out. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3181.36s)]
*  We were we had passed a bill called Plan Colombia. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3184.28s)]
*  And it was under Clinton, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3187.0800000000004s)]
*  which we allocated, I know, seven hundred million dollars [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3189.8s)]
*  to fight the drug war in Colombia. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3192.4s)]
*  Of the seven hundred million dollars, there was we gave sixty million dollars [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3194.48s)]
*  to Colombia for an alternate crops program. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3199.76s)]
*  So they give money to reseed and grow potatoes or coffee or whatever. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3202.72s)]
*  They're cooking the balance of it. Six hundred and twenty million. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3206.4399999999996s)]
*  Went to. A defense industry contractor in Connecticut [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3210.8799999999997s)]

*  I mean, that's what the drug war might. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3219.68s)]
*  And so, by the way, the sponsor of the bill was Chris Dodd, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3221.7599999999998s)]

*  What do you do with this system that really is an excuse to lock up black people? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3233.16s)]
*  But it came down to funny, because if you're a middle class, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3237.7999999999997s)]
*  might finally figure a way to get out. Yeah. But. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3240.12s)]
*  Well, that was one thing that Rolling Stone did cover, too, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3243.9599999999996s)]
*  is the difference in the discrepancy of the laws [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3246.3599999999997s)]
*  between crack cocaine and regular cocaine, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3249.56s)]
*  about how if you got arrested for crack, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3253.2s)]
*  you would have far steeper penalties, far longer sentences. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3256.88s)]
*  And, you know, one of the things that Dr. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3262.6s)]
*  Carl Hart, who's a guy out of Columbia, who's famously discussed, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3264.64s)]
*  is like, it's the exact same drug. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3268.72s)]
*  You you've done the only thing you've done with this is criminalize black people, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3270.76s)]
*  criminalize poor people, people of color and people that would be more likely [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3274.88s)]
*  to use cocaine so you could arrest them and lock them up for much longer sentences. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3279.72s)]
*  Exactly what exactly what is the [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3283.2400000000002s)]
*  it's the same. It's just cheaper. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3287.12s)]
*  It's more affordable to people who live in the ghetto or don't have money. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3290.44s)]
*  Lock them up. It was a it was a it was a race war. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3293.36s)]
*  I mean, we've come out this this country today. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3295.84s)]
*  I'm asked as our generation, have we made a difference? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3299.8s)]
*  What's changed? And. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3303.36s)]
*  It's not true of every single corner of America, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3306.32s)]
*  but it is true of most of America and majority of America. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3308.28s)]
*  We don't lock people up for this anymore. For drugs, people get off sex. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3311.28s)]
*  Between same sex is no longer criminalized. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3316.56s)]
*  Is it you can get married now. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3319.6s)]
*  You can get married before my generation came along. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3320.96s)]
*  Treatment of black people, the attitude towards the environment. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3324.68s)]
*  You know, it's just a it's a a more liberal and humane place today. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3328.72s)]
*  Yeah. And that I I try to make that point in my book, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3333.96s)]
*  not by, you know, a lot of political lecturing and so on like that, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3339.28s)]
*  but just showing what we covered and what we wrote about [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3341.6s)]
*  and how we went about those things, only advocated for and the way it all. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3344.44s)]
*  I thought if you took Rolling Stone, the history of Rolling Stone [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3348.6s)]
*  and looked at America through the eyes of Rolling Stone, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3352.2000000000003s)]
*  the prison of Rolling Stone, a cultural history of our times [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3355.16s)]
*  and rock and roll and all the great characters and, you know, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3359.16s)]
*  the people we met, the scientists and the environmental scientists [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3362.92s)]
*  and the writers and the presidents and particularly, you know, the rock [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3366.52s)]
*  and roll people, you you get a real true understanding of [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3370.16s)]
*  what happened during this whole period. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3374.08s)]
*  It never read anywhere before. Right. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3376.4s)]
*  And then I would use my own development as a narrative device. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3378.88s)]
*  You know, I didn't think my own sort of that interesting per se. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3383.4s)]
*  I went in and read a factual heavy duty, you know, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3386.24s)]
*  history of the civil rights laws and this that and the other thing. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3389.8399999999997s)]
*  But a cultural history of the times seen through my eyes [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3392.56s)]
*  and how much fun it was and how much fun we had. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3397.92s)]
*  And I didn't want to anyway shrink from the fact that all these big issues [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3402.36s)]
*  were at stake, which we were involved, but that was we had a great time. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3406.56s)]
*  It was a great generation. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3409.72s)]
*  Well, I don't think there's another publication that captured that. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3411.08s)]
*  Like Rolling Stone. I really don't. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3414.8s)]
*  I think I think we would have a distorted understanding of what went on [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3416.64s)]
*  during those years if it wasn't for your magazine. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3421.52s)]
*  I really, really think that. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3423.88s)]
*  I think we went in to report it accurately, to be the spokespeople [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3426.0s)]
*  for the musicians and for the musical community and the fans. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3431.44s)]
*  And the people really thought music was important in their lives, as I did. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3434.6s)]
*  Get involved in the social issues [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3439.52s)]
*  and say what was important to us as young people. Yeah. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3443.88s)]
*  What what we stood for and [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3448.16s)]
*  sort out what was the fluff and fluff like I never [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3452.12s)]
*  thought the yippies were something of marriage, major cultural significance. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3455.96s)]
*  What's the yippie? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3460.4s)]
*  A yippie was a thing formed by two revolutionaries, Abby Hoffman [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3461.48s)]
*  and a friend of his, which tried to promote a convention, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3465.44s)]
*  a demonstration in Chicago, Democratic Convention in Chicago, 1968, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3469.88s)]
*  which turned into the riots. Yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3474.7200000000003s)]
*  But I never thought they can radical politics [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3476.56s)]
*  was quite where young people were at and where our generation was at. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3480.0s)]
*  It was political, but we didn't advocate violence. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3484.08s)]
*  We weren't like throwing bombs or telling people what to do. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3487.92s)]
*  I mean, we're saying go have fun. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3491.2000000000003s)]
*  What were the yippies trying to do? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3493.56s)]
*  I'm sorry about them up. Why? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3498.12s)]
*  I don't know. They were just kind of a performance art thing. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3500.6s)]
*  They did go down the Wall Street and throw money onto the stock. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3503.56s)]
*  It was fun, but it wasn't the serious mainstream [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3507.48s)]
*  part of what young people, the new generation was about. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3511.28s)]
*  The new generation was really about, you know, love and all that stuff. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3515.52s)]
*  Yeah. And love doesn't conquer all, but it conquers. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3520.2s)]
*  I'm sounding like a hippie here. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3524.36s)]
*  I think you are a hippie. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3526.6s)]
*  I think it's fair. I'm still. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3527.76s)]
*  I think I'm a hippie, too. Yeah. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3530.12s)]
*  It's just there's parts of it that got fucked up. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3532.44s)]
*  Yeah. Or there were maybe nonsense. Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3535.6s)]
*  To begin with. I mean, I don't need to live with, you know, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3538.12s)]
*  12 different people in the community anymore. Right. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3541.0s)]
*  I don't need to eat brown. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3543.04s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of extremes on it. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3544.12s)]
*  There was ideas that people had, I think, and idealism. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3546.2s)]
*  Yeah. Idealism. Yeah. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3549.8s)]
*  And yeah. So in any movement, you know, it goes a little too far. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3551.36s)]
*  Or I can meet to, you know, that becomes ridiculous. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3555.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm in trouble. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3558.12s)]
*  And it goes to fight. It has to be brought back to think. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3560.12s)]
*  But there's a good idea in there. Right. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3562.84s)]
*  There's a meaningful, valuable lesson for us. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3565.12s)]
*  And there was a good thing in the hippie scene. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3567.68s)]
*  It was a great thing in a rock and roll scene. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3570.3199999999997s)]
*  And some of it just got excessive. Yeah. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3572.44s)]
*  But, you know, I just think you guys captured that. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3575.6s)]
*  You captured all of it. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3579.3199999999997s)]
*  You captured all of the chaos and you did it in an honest way. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3580.2799999999997s)]
*  And you did it in a way where I don't think the writers [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3583.0s)]
*  that wrote in Rolling Stone would have ever had the kind of freedom [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3586.2799999999997s)]
*  to capture things the way you allowed them to be captured, the way, you know, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3590.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, you guys were the only voice. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3595.16s)]
*  It's true. I mean, I mean, there was a village voice. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3598.44s)]
*  There was a couple of other publications that, you know, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3600.3999999999996s)]
*  but not with this circulation, the impact. Right. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3603.52s)]
*  And the also the incredible amount of talent. Right. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3606.64s)]
*  Of writing skill and photographs that we brought to the occasion. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3610.44s)]
*  I mean, you go through Rolling Stone or the covers of Rolling Stone. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3614.52s)]
*  It's the story of your life. Yeah. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3617.16s)]
*  And even for the, you know, even as the last 10 years and so on. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3618.96s)]
*  And it was a point of view about the world. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3622.68s)]
*  And I think that point of view still stands. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3624.52s)]
*  It doesn't, you know, it's I think young people today, for instance, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3628.64s)]
*  are idly still idealistic. Yes. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3632.4s)]
*  Still want, I mean, to save the earth. Yeah. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3635.16s)]
*  And and I think they don't look down on the baby boom. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3638.36s)]
*  I don't believe in this go boomer stuff. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3642.48s)]
*  You know, I don't think there's an attitude towards boomers from young people [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3645.24s)]
*  with ready boomers, steady, whatever it's called. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3649.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't. OK. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3651.96s)]
*  Yeah. OK. Yeah. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3654.16s)]
*  Well, there's you know, there's always a dismissal of the previous generations, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3655.44s)]
*  you know, because the new generations are moving in a a different direction [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3659.2s)]
*  or at least expanding. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3663.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, they're learning from the lessons of the past [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3664.72s)]
*  and what they didn't like about their parents, generations, and they're expanding. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3667.24s)]
*  You know, it's just today it's it's hard to track [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3671.56s)]
*  because there's so many voices and there's so much going on. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3675.0s)]
*  And there's also this fear that things are actually rolling back [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3678.16s)]
*  in the wrong direction, like this overturning of Roe v. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3681.72s)]
*  Wade. That scares the shit out of a lot of people. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3684.48s)]
*  And the talk of overturning same sex marriages, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3686.72s)]
*  that scares the shit out of a lot of people, too, because they really are [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3690.16s)]
*  worried that some of these people that don't like this progress [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3692.64s)]
*  and don't like the freedom that people are enjoying today [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3698.04s)]
*  and they want to pull things back and they want to control people more. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3701.16s)]

*  is so out of step with America, is so cruel. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3714.72s)]
*  And every one of those policies cite there, there's cruelty at the basis of it. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3718.52s)]
*  To every every economic policy they advocate [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3725.16s)]

*  And to put it a different way, we're upset the weather system. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3911.0s)]

*  All Miami's one random hurricane. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3926.88s)]
*  Away from destruction. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3931.2799999999997s)]
*  Look what happened this week in Florida on the west coast of Florida. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3933.04s)]
*  We know that's always happened in Florida, and it's always happened with with hurricanes. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3937.24s)]
*  Do you know that hurricanes are more frequent, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3941.52s)]
*  but less destructive now than they were in 20 years? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3943.72s)]
*  I've heard 20 years ago. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3946.7599999999998s)]
*  I've heard the opposite. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3948.0s)]
*  They're less frequent and more destructive because they contain more water [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3949.28s)]
*  and then more wind in them due to the heating of the Caribbean. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3952.92s)]
*  In fact, the Caribbean is about two degrees, three degrees warmer [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3955.88s)]
*  this summer than it was last summer. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3959.24s)]
*  But it'll happen. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3961.12s)]
*  I mean, it randomly these things really striking. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3962.52s)]
*  They're more destructive. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3965.32s)]
*  They're all it takes is one of those hurricanes. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3966.12s)]
*  It was 12 feet wave coming into Fort Myers. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3968.52s)]
*  That'll happen in Miami or will happen in Virginia. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3973.32s)]
*  We've covered this extensively in Rolling Stone, and I know my stuff. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3976.56s)]
*  And we've had a on the subject. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3980.44s)]
*  I. Pay attention to a lot, and it's no joke. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3982.24s)]
*  I mean, it's nothing you can think is going to reverse the the the weather. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3986.7599999999998s)]
*  It's to these things are too powerful. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3992.48s)]
*  We do things as men, as humans, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3994.56s)]
*  like build seawalls that can hold back and do the consulate deal a lot with that. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=3997.3599999999997s)]
*  But if you were too vulnerable, the forests of the West, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4002.68s)]
*  you know, the rainforest, which is being cut down in by Bolsonaro in Brazil [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4008.72s)]
*  or in Congo, they're just going to now open that up. I mean, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4013.8399999999997s)]
*  we can't be doing this anymore. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4018.96s)]
*  I mean, honestly, it's a hard thing to see. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4020.44s)]
*  Global warming, carbon is an invisible gas, odorless and cost. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4024.0800000000004s)]

*  And was France, which has like 50 percent or something, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4146.0s)]
*  or maybe more of its power come from nuclear. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4149.5599999999995s)]
*  They never have had a nuclear accident, and they've had nuclear for 50 years or more. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4152.44s)]
*  They've never had an accident because they got one reactor in shape [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4156.799999999999s)]
*  and they decided to replicate that reactor all throughout the country. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4160.24s)]
*  They didn't. Every new reactor was in a newly built design [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4163.2s)]
*  that cost twice as much because you had to redesign the entire thing. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4166.28s)]
*  Do you think that the general public has a distorted perception [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4169.36s)]
*  of the safety of nuclear, though? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4172.64s)]
*  We're scared of nuclear. A lot of people are. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4174.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because of the panics you just mentioned. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4176.64s)]
*  Yeah. Chernobyl. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4179.28s)]
*  They had to vacate, you know, thousands of miles, miles of territory. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4180.76s)]
*  I think so. I think that we'd be. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4185.28s)]
*  I don't think it's the solution, but I think it's part of the solution now. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4190.4s)]
*  That should be one of the things we go after. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4194.12s)]
*  But we've got to go after the other things. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4196.2s)]
*  Rebuilding America is a more energy efficient place. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4199.76s)]
*  But do you think that the Democratic Party is any less fucked up? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4203.36s)]
*  They're pretty fucked up, too. I think much less. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4206.5599999999995s)]
*  So, I mean, don't you think they're all captured by money? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4209.36s)]
*  Not all of them. No, but less of them. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4212.5599999999995s)]
*  Far less of them. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4215.4s)]
*  You can. The money that's being allocated for the environment [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4216.4s)]
*  or for so for any of these things. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4219.92s)]
*  They're passed with pure only Democrats voting for them [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4222.88s)]
*  and Republicans voting in general unanimously against them, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4226.0s)]
*  whether it's voting rights, whether it's women's rights, whether abortion. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4228.68s)]
*  The entire congressional Democratic Republican Party [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4232.6s)]
*  will vote against abortion, you know, at this stage, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4235.0s)]
*  if it comes into if it's introduced in Congress. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4238.52s)]
*  Do you think that's just a political issue? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4241.68s)]
*  Like, they think that that's what their constituents want. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4244.32s)]
*  Do you think that there's some sort of a more nefarious agenda? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4246.52s)]
*  I think that they want to keep their jobs as senators or congressmen. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4250.2s)]
*  And they are living fear that the that the people with the majority [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4253.599999999999s)]
*  of the minority of the Republican Party that controls and goes to primary [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4259.32s)]
*  elections, because it's always on both ends, the activists [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4264.2s)]
*  were really ideological, driven, whether right or different, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4267.799999999999s)]
*  can control the primary. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4271.719999999999s)]
*  And they they're afraid they'll lose their jobs, because if you say, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4272.839999999999s)]
*  I'm for abortion, I mean, I'm for abortion. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4275.5199999999995s)]
*  They'll turn out this huge thing and Trump will come down the road [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4278.04s)]
*  and start screaming at you, too. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4281.36s)]
*  And they'll and they've been blackmailed by Trump by this. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4282.719999999999s)]
*  You're not going to get reelected. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4286.48s)]
*  I think these things we're talking about are all moral issues. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4287.959999999999s)]
*  The survival of the Earth is a moral issue. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4291.32s)]
*  The right to abortion is a moral issue. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4293.599999999999s)]
*  The right to marry who you choose or the right to have equal rights. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4295.24s)]
*  If you're black or [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4298.5199999999995s)]
*  a moral issue or if you're a woman or more. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4300.919999999999s)]
*  But and I think there's much more morality [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4303.679999999999s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, which is more liberal. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4306.84s)]
*  And they are they are. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4309.64s)]
*  But every time you read about a money scandal or sex scandal, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4314.24s)]
*  nine out of ten times, it's a Republican representative. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4317.04s)]
*  It's the guy with his hand in the till or in a hoochie, you know, and. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4320.84s)]
*  It seems look at look at the president's, look at Reagan, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4326.88s)]
*  look at Bush, Jr., look at Trump. I mean, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4329.64s)]
*  it wasn't Biden involved in a lot of nefarious and shady shit. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4333.4s)]
*  I don't think so. You don't think so? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4337.48s)]
*  You don't think all that stuff that's going on with his son in Ukraine? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4339.0s)]
*  And I think that Ukraine's what Hunter Biden did try to talk about. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4341.92s)]
*  Pull that. Oh, sorry. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4346.0s)]
*  What what hard Biden did in Ukraine was wrong. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4347.839999999999s)]
*  And I think it was wrong for his father. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4351.12s)]
*  I say you can't do this. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4352.839999999999s)]
*  You know, this is the risk of my career and reputation [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4354.24s)]
*  because this is just doesn't pass the shady test. Right. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4356.879999999999s)]
*  But he's been involved a lot of shit. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4359.759999999999s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't think Hunter or Joe. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4362.599999999999s)]
*  No, Joe. Like what? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4364.76s)]
*  Well, just what has been shown on the laptop that his son was paying money to him. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4367.0s)]
*  I don't think I don't. I've never seen that written anywhere. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4372.48s)]
*  You haven't seen that there was kickbacks? No, I haven't. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4375.64s)]
*  No, I'm totally unaware of it. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4378.64s)]
*  I mean, so I'm not going to. OK. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4380.48s)]
*  All I can say is that if it's not in [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4382.28s)]
*  the reputable media, the New York Times [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4385.8s)]
*  or other places or the official agency of government [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4390.08s)]
*  don't endorse this point of view or or say I am suspect of [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4393.5599999999995s)]
*  a non vetted process, which is not investigated [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4400.8s)]
*  because there's so much rumor around [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4405.08s)]
*  throughout the Internet. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4408.16s)]
*  Then the Internet is unvetted. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4409.24s)]
*  Nobody anybody can put anything they want on it. Right. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4411.32s)]
*  No matter how scandalous this grows or made up. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4414.0s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4416.48s)]
*  But have you read Matt Taibbi stuff? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4417.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I know. I mean, Matt writes for me. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4419.16s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4420.96s)]
*  And I have he doesn't write for only some now, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4423.8s)]
*  but no, I haven't read the recent stuff. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4426.5199999999995s)]
*  So I will go that. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4428.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Matt is probably one of my favorite writers of today. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4430.759999999999s)]
*  My favorite journalist of today. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4434.5599999999995s)]
*  I can understand. I can understand why. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4436.2s)]
*  He is one of the funny. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4438.96s)]
*  He's the only person that ever came close to Hunter. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4439.88s)]
*  Yes. No, he's hilarious. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4441.639999999999s)]
*  His coverage of the economic crisis is great. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4442.96s)]
*  I mean, especially the 2008 crisis is fucking amazing. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4446.400000000001s)]
*  The vampire squid. Yeah. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4451.24s)]
*  I mean, that's that's right. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4452.64s)]
*  Matt was another guy who his copy would come in. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4454.12s)]
*  His story and I read it and he just sometimes just burst out. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4457.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Laughing. I mean, he had so much funny stuff. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4460.24s)]
*  I really want to quote him extensive. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4463.24s)]
*  I couldn't quote him extensively, but but several of his best things are [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4465.2s)]
*  in the book and he his sense of outrage. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4468.76s)]
*  He was perfect for this time. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4470.92s)]
*  Matt himself is, though, also subject to a little bit of a conspiracy, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4472.96s)]
*  you know, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4479.32s)]
*  throw bomb throwing. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4481.72s)]
*  Let's mix it up, you know, stuff. So, I mean. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4483.4s)]
*  Conspiracy. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  Like how so? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4487.4s)]
*  I think I'm just saying is mentally, I haven't seen anything that [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4488.4s)]
*  that the theory that all parties are the same [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4493.4s)]
*  and that it's not going to make any difference to our lives [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4497.76s)]
*  and Democrats as bad as Republicans. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4500.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's nuts. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4502.24s)]
*  So you think, well, I think socially Democrats, at least in spirit, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4503.48s)]
*  what they're trying to do, at least on paper, what they're trying to say [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4508.2s)]
*  is more in line of like this idea that you're talking about [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4513.0s)]
*  with the original Rolling Stone, the hippie movement, more in line of [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4518.08s)]
*  expanding rights and giving people more opportunity and giving people more freedom. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4522.0s)]
*  I think that's when you when you talk to like a liberal or progressive ideologically, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4528.36s)]
*  that's what they're hoping for. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4533.92s)]
*  Like that's whether they're captured by money, you know, at the highest levels, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4535.32s)]
*  which I think they kind of all are until you remove money from politics. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4541.04s)]
*  We're always going to have a problem with special interest groups [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4545.5199999999995s)]
*  that are fine financing both sides. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4547.96s)]
*  But I think and that's true. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4550.759999999999s)]
*  And I think there's long record of Democrats [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4554.32s)]
*  accepting just I just mentioned Joe Dodd and six hundred [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4556.48s)]
*  and twenty million siphoned off for the drug war into the defense industry. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4560.12s)]
*  You know, the. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4563.5599999999995s)]
*  But if you look at what and money will always be important, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4566.4s)]
*  there's ways to reduce money, but the Republicans bought you [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4569.879999999999s)]
*  the Supreme Court decision that led corporate financing back in, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4572.679999999999s)]
*  which is why now it looks so expensive. Right. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4576.24s)]
*  I think it's always going to be the idea. But. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4579.0s)]
*  Let's look at fundamental fairness. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4583.04s)]
*  Is it right? For billionaires [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4585.16s)]
*  to pay no taxes or effectively very little taxes, some of them. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4589.12s)]
*  And the working man gets tax rates, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4593.68s)]
*  bills, I mean, the inequitable distribution of wealth is so inequitable, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4597.68s)]
*  you know, and then on top of it, we ask the poor, the middle class [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4602.44s)]
*  to pay enormous medical costs [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4605.76s)]
*  that they can afford without giving any any really much meaningful aid to them. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4608.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, we ask that [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4612.92s)]
*  the carbon industry [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4616.4400000000005s)]
*  continue to pollute and their pollution, by the way, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4620.0s)]
*  locate always in the poorest area of a town is where the refinery is. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4623.4400000000005s)]
*  The call is that these are Republican agenda items. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4626.92s)]
*  These are all on record. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4631.6s)]
*  Take this take legalization marijuana. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4633.64s)]
*  It's an official part of the Democratic Party platform. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4635.88s)]
*  But why haven't they done it? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4639.52s)]
*  Why? Why hasn't Biden done it? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4641.0s)]
*  Because one of the things that they talked about during the campaign [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4642.76s)]
*  was decriminalizing marijuana and exonerating people that were in [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4646.08s)]
*  in jail for nonviolent drug offenses. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4652.36s)]
*  I haven't they done any of that? I think because. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4654.52s)]
*  One, right now it is happening at a very state's levels. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4659.08s)]
*  These laws are not being enforced anymore, and I think that's the general climate. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4663.36s)]
*  Why they have not moved in a Congress and Senate [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4666.76s)]
*  and the House and Senate to pass this plank, I don't know. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4670.32s)]
*  I presume they may not have the votes because some people want [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4673.0s)]
*  are still too scared of voting against it or they they are lined up with the police. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4677.04s)]
*  The prison industry is very likely lined up with the Republicans. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4682.5599999999995s)]
*  But the fact that it's just on the platform itself. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4686.8s)]
*  Remember, when you and I started smoking dope, it was disrespectful. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4689.24s)]
*  You go to jail. Now the Democrats say legalize the fucker. Right. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4692.44s)]
*  So everyone should be saying it at this point in time. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4696.44s)]
*  If you're really a fan of freedom. Yeah. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4698.96s)]
*  But the Republicans are not. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4700.92s)]
*  You know, I mean, Trump. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4702.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm OK. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4706.84s)]
*  This is my current hobby. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4709.12s)]
*  So I'm not I'll just turn current hobby horse. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4710.12s)]
*  Well, the thing I go on about is because it's political season [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4712.56s)]
*  is the Republican Party, which I just [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4716.52s)]
*  I know you're not supposed to talk politics and ever, but, you know, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4719.4800000000005s)]
*  as a party, they're a roadblock to the kind of America I believe in, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4723.52s)]
*  which is a progressive America, a liberal America, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4728.16s)]
*  a compassionate America that says to its poor people, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4731.04s)]
*  you know, we'll help you. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4734.92s)]
*  We'll provide you medical care, we'll make you get food. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4736.28s)]
*  We guarantee you the right to life. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4738.639999999999s)]
*  Which includes health care, liberty. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4742.72s)]
*  Your own personal life and happiness, you know, and [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4745.72s)]
*  I think those are the should be the founding [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4750.36s)]
*  principles of America, and I think they should be offered to everybody, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4752.8s)]
*  not just to the super wealthy or the mid wealthy or people like myself. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4755.96s)]
*  You know, why? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4760.52s)]
*  This is a basic American promise. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4762.240000000001s)]
*  That's a that. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4763.72s)]
*  Is I just don't see that in a Republican Party. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4766.04s)]
*  I don't see any part of it. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4768.6s)]
*  No, I don't. I don't see that from enough people in general, period, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4770.4800000000005s)]
*  especially people that are already doing well. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4774.280000000001s)]
*  I think particularly those things you talked about. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4777.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, my thought is education. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4780.200000000001s)]
*  The fact that people are so bored, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4783.32s)]
*  just burdened with debt when they get out of college. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4786.56s)]
*  You can never escape that debt. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4790.08s)]
*  That's that's a fucking that's a crime against humanity. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4792.0s)]
*  The fact that they've decided to make that one debt, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4795.08s)]
*  the one debt that you kind of have to take on. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4798.16s)]
*  Most people think when you get out of high school, you have to go to college [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4802.400000000001s)]
*  and it's going to cost you some money, especially if you don't have a scholarship. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4805.4400000000005s)]
*  That that debt you can never escape. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4809.12s)]
*  That to me is insane. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4811.48s)]
*  OK, who is behind that? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4813.16s)]
*  The only thing that's now moved to change that, to start lifting the debt off [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4814.84s)]
*  is Biden and the Democrats past got that stuff through Biden. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4819.16s)]
*  What did they pass through? [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4822.8s)]
*  Oh, they passed through laws which you can get ten thousand dollars [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4824.08s)]
*  taken off your debt now. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4827.36s)]
*  And haven't they rolled that back? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4829.0s)]
*  No, they wasn't there just some discussion where there was [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4830.64s)]
*  for Republican governors. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4833.4s)]
*  No, but it was just Biden just no, just backed off of it. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4836.08s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4839.76s)]
*  There was something that was in the that I was just reading yesterday. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4840.6s)]
*  It's been held up because Republican officeholders have sued [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4844.080000000001s)]
*  in the courts to stop as being a constitutional. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4848.6s)]
*  Donald Trump has his education secretary, Betsy DeVos. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4850.76s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4855.080000000001s)]
*  Biden's rollback of student loan forgiveness plan [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4855.84s)]
*  pulls up the curtain on his Potemkin White House. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4858.4400000000005s)]
*  What website does that come from? [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4861.6s)]
*  Fox News. Surprise, surprise. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4864.4400000000005s)]
*  No, no, it's not. That's from Fox News. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4867.120000000001s)]
*  It's the New York Post. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4868.96s)]
*  Same video. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4870.76s)]
*  The videos that the the it's on the OK. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4871.44s)]
*  The video, the site, the source society. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4875.16s)]
*  Biden that's fear legal action, excluding these borrowers, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4877.28s)]
*  might make it harder for anyone successfully to stop it. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4881.04s)]
*  But that's practically an admission. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4883.4800000000005s)]
*  The whole program is legally dubious. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4884.8s)]
*  Thursday, Department of Education said borrowers with privately held [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4887.76s)]
*  federal student loans were no longer qualify for President Biden's [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4891.52s)]
*  one time loan write off program. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4895.44s)]
*  So this is borrowers with privately held federal student loans [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4898.16s)]
*  will no longer qualify. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4901.96s)]
*  Indeed, just a year ago, the Education Department admitted [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4904.320000000001s)]
*  it lacked the statutory authority to forgive student loans en masse. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4907.92s)]
*  Yet then, Team Biden, under pressure from progressives [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4913.4400000000005s)]
*  and hoping to boost Dems hopes in the midterms, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4916.4800000000005s)]
*  suddenly announced a huge forgiveness program, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4919.360000000001s)]

*  In NPR, OK, in NPR, in a reversal, which now says [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4943.12s)]

*  This has to say. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4954.8s)]

*  of many student loan borrowers. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4959.24s)]

*  student debt relief plan. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4967.72s)]
*  At the center of the change are borrowers who took out the federal [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4969.4400000000005s)]

*  were once the mainstay of the federal loan program [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4984.48s)]
*  until the FFEL program ended in 2010. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4988.0s)]
*  Today, according to federal data, more than four million borrowers [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4991.24s)]
*  still have commercially held FFEL loans until Thursday. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4994.96s)]
*  The department's own website advised these borrowers [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=4999.32s)]
*  they could consolidate these loans into federal direct loans [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5002.32s)]

*  All loans eligible for student loan [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5010.24s)]

*  and guarantee agencies. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5016.72s)]
*  ED assesses whether to provide relief to borrowers with privately owned [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5018.12s)]
*  federal student loans, including FFEL Perkins loans, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5022.4s)]
*  and is discussing with private lenders. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5025.96s)]
*  In the meantime, borrowers with privately held federal loans [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5027.88s)]
*  can receive this relief by consolidating these loans in a direct loan program. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5031.28s)]
*  All eligible borrowers will have until December 31st, 2023 [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5035.2s)]
*  to submit an application for debt relief. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5040.12s)]
*  So what does it say? Thursday, though, here it is. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5043.2s)]
*  Go scroll down lower, please. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5045.4800000000005s)]
*  Thursday, though, the department quietly changed that language. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5047.320000000001s)]
*  The guidance says now, as of September 29th, 2022, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5050.64s)]
*  borrowers with federal student loans not held by ED [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5055.400000000001s)]
*  cannot obtain one time debt relief by consolidating these loans into direct loans. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5059.6s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5065.12s)]
*  They they pass student loan relief. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5066.68s)]
*  To survive the challenge by Republicans in courts, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5069.88s)]
*  as to whether this constitution, laws constitutional or not, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5073.8s)]
*  whether it can be done under the authority that you presided pretty easily. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5076.52s)]
*  They've pulled back on some meantime. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5081.4800000000005s)]
*  The other half is still eligible. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5085.2s)]
*  So while they haven't gotten everything, they've gotten at least half [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5087.04s)]
*  or 30 percent or 40 percent, 20 or 70 percent are still eligible for loan relief. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5090.52s)]
*  This is passed by the Democrats. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5095.4800000000005s)]
*  It's being challenged by the Republicans. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5097.08s)]
*  And the reason has been pulled back is to make that challenge go away [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5098.76s)]
*  or be less potent in court by those things that they thought might be [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5102.72s)]
*  questionable constitutionally. They pulled them back. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5106.4s)]
*  So it's the Republicans that are public. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5108.72s)]
*  The Republicans have caused this. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5110.84s)]
*  Trump had as a secretary, Betsy DeVos was the head of the Secretary of Education. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5112.8s)]
*  They refused to do anything about student loan relief. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5117.12s)]
*  In fact, she owned one of the biggest scam private [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5119.88s)]
*  college systems that was around. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5123.64s)]
*  And and all the scam. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5125.4s)]
*  And she refused it. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5128.5599999999995s)]
*  And she was that she did with the scams. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5129.92s)]
*  She didn't bail. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5132.2s)]
*  She wouldn't reimburse for all the scam stuff [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5133.759999999999s)]
*  that the private education business of what she was one of the biggest factors in. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5137.4s)]
*  What's the scam? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5141.679999999999s)]
*  Giving them loans to go to Alpha University, which happens to be in Hoboken [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5144.36s)]
*  and exists on your mail order universities and stuff like that. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5148.719999999999s)]
*  It wasn't called the college of Alpha University. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5152.84s)]
*  But my larger point is this and the larger point is that. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5154.8s)]
*  The money for education, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5159.360000000001s)]
*  which, as you said, is a ticket to society, to a private society [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5161.280000000001s)]
*  and for lower education, a public school system is not being [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5164.84s)]
*  they will not spend that money on education. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5169.68s)]
*  Instead, you've got people worth 100 billion dollars. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5172.360000000001s)]
*  You got dozens of people with 100 billion. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5175.320000000001s)]
*  That money would be better spent on the purposes of society. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5177.72s)]
*  That we want, which is we want an educated and employed and productive. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5182.4s)]
*  How would you go about allocating that money, though? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5187.4s)]
*  What would you advise? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5190.16s)]
*  Like, what how do you think? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5191.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're so you're talking about like a redistribution of wealth. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5193.36s)]
*  I'm talking about a fair progressive tax system [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5196.0s)]
*  in which the relative tax burdens for poor people and wealthy people [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5199.32s)]
*  are much the same. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5203.5199999999995s)]
*  So relative to their income, say, relative to their income. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5205.08s)]
*  Maybe they should each report person makes twenty thousand dollars a year [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5208.2s)]
*  and has to pay five thousand in taxes should pay no taxes. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5211.88s)]
*  I mean, you can't, you know, right. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5215.04s)]
*  You could barely live off that anyway. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5216.76s)]
*  You can't live off, you know, so they should pay no taxes. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5218.08s)]
*  Nobody under 50. I'm guessing the numbers. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5222.16s)]
*  I mean, I understand what you're saying. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5224.32s)]
*  Whereas people who are making income of [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5226.28s)]
*  100 million dollars a year, let alone 10 million dollars a year, should pay. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5229.68s)]
*  Start paying a rate of 50 percent and escalate up. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5234.64s)]
*  So if you're making a billion dollars, escalate up. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5237.6s)]
*  Yes, more than 50 percent. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5239.76s)]
*  Absolutely. I think. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5241.4400000000005s)]
*  But 50 percent would at least be a huge start. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5242.88s)]
*  Right. And where here's my question, where does that money go? [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5246.4800000000005s)]
*  How about education? Right. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5250.360000000001s)]
*  But but who decides where that money goes and how do we keep people [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5251.68s)]
*  from profiting off of the redistribution of that money? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5256.240000000001s)]
*  Much like you were talking about the war on drugs, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5259.280000000001s)]
*  that the money went to defense contractors to make helicopters. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5261.88s)]
*  That was the bulk of it. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5265.0s)]
*  Like, how do you stop that money when it's being reallocated? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5266.32s)]
*  How do you stop that from being a fraud? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5270.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's very that's tough. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5272.679999999999s)]
*  It requires really vigorous attention. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5275.719999999999s)]
*  And we don't have that with anything. Well, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5279.84s)]
*  isn't that what people are terrified of? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5282.92s)]
*  What people are terrified of is these laws getting enacted [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5284.96s)]
*  and then watching the same sort of scam play out now [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5287.8s)]
*  under the guise of being progressive and how much money [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5292.44s)]
*  has been pilfered out of the funds for covid relief. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5295.84s)]
*  A lot of huge. I mean, hundreds of millions. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5299.68s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of it went to corporations that didn't even fucking need it. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5302.400000000001s)]
*  Or maybe. Yeah. I mean, I know. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5306.08s)]
*  I would see, you know, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5309.68s)]
*  concept owners who are super wealthy [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5313.52s)]
*  ask for relief because they they didn't need it. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5316.52s)]
*  But anyway, I think that you're going to have to in all government [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5319.4400000000005s)]
*  big spending, whether it's government or corporate, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5322.76s)]
*  accept a certain amount of fraud or leakage or shoplifting. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5325.0s)]
*  I mean, it just comes with the territory. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5328.280000000001s)]
*  People may need to shoplift and there's evil people and scam artists. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5330.6s)]
*  And you try and do your best, you know. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5334.56s)]
*  But in a system this big, you can't be perfect. Right. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5337.400000000001s)]
*  Even though you can't be perfect, you can do a lot of good. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5339.88s)]
*  And is it better to not help people who are starving [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5343.68s)]
*  or living on food stamps or can't get education with their kids? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5348.360000000001s)]
*  To help them and accept a certain level of fraud. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5352.48s)]
*  You know, and you can also pass laws that call for inspector generals [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5356.36s)]
*  and effective prosecution of people. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5360.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, again, the Trump department's looked over every. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5362.839999999999s)]
*  They didn't care about it at all. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5366.5599999999995s)]
*  They they they cut the tax services. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5368.599999999999s)]
*  They wouldn't let them hire more people just to audit people. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5371.16s)]
*  I mean, that's not fair. You know. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5373.759999999999s)]
*  So I'm all for people getting rich. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5377.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm for people making a lot of money. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5379.36s)]
*  But it's a point at which your money does. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5380.839999999999s)]
*  You can't do anything with your money. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5384.04s)]
*  You're for that money getting allocated to things that are going to help [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5385.5199999999995s)]
*  the country and help human beings as a whole. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5390.639999999999s)]
*  You know what? Matt Tybee, I got this idea looking [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5393.28s)]
*  reading his stuff he wrote Rolling Stone at the time. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5396.92s)]
*  He said this vast private wealth [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5400.04s)]

*  and by billionaires, it is the least productive use of capital in the world. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5407.92s)]
*  This is money being held privately, not being used to serve any useful purpose. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5413.4800000000005s)]

*  This capital is the least productive use of our human wealth. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5427.12s)]
*  Do you think it's just that when people get money, they want more money? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5433.4800000000005s)]
*  And then they get into a position of power and they want to do [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5437.92s)]
*  whatever they can to keep that money going and keep it rolling. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5440.72s)]

*  The question is, where does it go and who's going to manage it? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5469.64s)]
*  And that's the real question. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5472.200000000001s)]
*  What people are terrified of is the reallocation of wealth [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5473.080000000001s)]
*  by people who are not good at managing anything. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5476.92s)]

*  But then it's just going to penalize the people that are out there [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5483.120000000001s)]

*  They've been getting and not paying any taxes at all. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5509.8s)]

*  You know, but also I think that. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5518.16s)]
*  Who pays the expense? [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5521.76s)]
*  The government is the instrument we have and we can choose our government [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5523.32s)]

*  Some of them well, some of them bad, you know, because every bureaucracy [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5540.5199999999995s)]

*  What else do you have besides democratically elected government to choose from? [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5548.0s)]
*  Autocracy is in China, which distributes money fairly well. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5552.16s)]
*  But I don't trust a billionaire [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5557.36s)]

*  You think you've got it. The world figured out. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5576.96s)]
*  I'm surprised how many wealthy, wealthy, super wealthy people [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5579.68s)]
*  I met who don't understand politics and political power because [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5583.240000000001s)]
*  they have no sensitivity for the people or other things. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5588.52s)]
*  I mean, everybody who gets that, well, they think they're really smart. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5593.360000000001s)]
*  Everybody who gets that wealth. Yeah, they think they're really smart. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5596.6s)]
*  Do you think that it's akin to fame in a lot of ways? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5599.16s)]
*  Is that, you know, you can get captured by fame. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5601.8s)]
*  You can get captured by extreme wealth, too. Oh, yeah. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5603.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. Dead on. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5607.04s)]
*  So it becomes a thing where you are captured by this this pursuit. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5608.92s)]
*  I'm so special. Right. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5614.08s)]
*  I'm in a special position because I'm so smart. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5615.4s)]
*  And then you're around other people that also feel the same way. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5617.52s)]
*  And then you're in this sort of billionaires weird club [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5620.12s)]
*  where you're only surrounded by people that are doing the same kind of thing. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5623.24s)]
*  Sounds like you live in New York City, but it could be anywhere. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5627.12s)]
*  It could be anywhere where you get massive wealth and and people [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5630.28s)]
*  that are in that tiny percentage of human beings. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5634.36s)]

*  Because I could roll over. Don't worry. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5646.16s)]
*  I think that we really have to. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5648.36s)]
*  Try our best to confront this situation in the history of the world. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5651.36s)]
*  Never has been the wealth that this disparity been so great. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5654.6s)]
*  I've had people had so much money. Right. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5657.72s)]
*  What do you do with a billion dollars? I can't figure out. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5661.08s)]
*  What do you do with a hundred billion dollars? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5663.72s)]
*  Even if you say you're going to give 50 billion dollars away, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5665.4800000000005s)]
*  it's to the things you like or the museums you like or the right particular causes. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5668.48s)]
*  But let the people decide what it should go for. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5672.72s)]
*  Do we want we have a pot to do as you get our kids better? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5678.76s)]
*  Do we want to do drug programs? Do we want to do this thing? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5682.04s)]
*  We'll elect our representatives. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5684.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's true in a good functioning democracy, which this is. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5686.2s)]
*  This is what happens. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5690.88s)]
*  Do we have fraud? Yes, of course. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5692.8s)]
*  You have fraud in every level of society. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5694.88s)]
*  Do you have greed? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5697.04s)]
*  Yeah, we have greed in every level of society. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5699.2s)]
*  You know, there's the the whole phenomenon being anti-immigrant, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5701.08s)]
*  I think, or racist as part of why should we let them have that money? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5705.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, they don't deserve it's our money. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5708.96s)]
*  You know, we live here. We're Americans. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5710.48s)]
*  And it's like in the worst of people. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5713.44s)]
*  I mean, I think your philosophy and your mindset speaks to [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5716.5199999999995s)]
*  why you started Rolling Stone in the first place. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5721.12s)]
*  You generally want the world to be a better place. Yeah. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5723.56s)]
*  And I think we we came along [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5726.28s)]
*  and get so much money and education, so much privilege [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5728.32s)]
*  that it's only natural that we were. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5732.36s)]
*  And then we were taught to share that there was an American dream. Right. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5734.72s)]
*  And we were taught the principles found this country [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5738.0s)]
*  were justice and liberty. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5741.639999999999s)]
*  And I think where people get confused and scared is they don't see a clear path. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5743.04s)]
*  They don't see a path that makes sense. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5749.0s)]
*  They don't see a leader that speaks in a way that resonates, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5750.599999999999s)]
*  that really seems to seem like a person really just does want better for people. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5754.5199999999995s)]
*  They see people that are speaking to their special interests [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5760.599999999999s)]
*  and they're just saying all the right things. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5763.48s)]
*  And then when they get in the office, they do the same shit [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5765.599999999999s)]
*  that everybody's done and, you know, fund the military industrial complex [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5767.4s)]
*  and get us involved in interventionist foreign policy [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5771.88s)]
*  and make it more and more dangerous in the world. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5774.639999999999s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5778.0s)]
*  And except. There's degrees. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5779.599999999999s)]
*  And I think what I've learned growing up and getting older person, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5784.8s)]
*  what I've learned from watching politics and watching all these [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5789.32s)]
*  movements is that change is gradual [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5794.08s)]
*  and nobody is very few people are perfect. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5797.36s)]
*  Take a a senator we have from New York, Chuck Schumer. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5800.599999999999s)]
*  On the one hand, like he sponsored this campus legislation, he sponsored. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5805.88s)]
*  He's going to try and do everything he can to bring back the rights to abortion. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5811.04s)]
*  On the other hand, he's a major [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5816.4400000000005s)]
*  acceptor of contributions from hedge fund guys, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5818.68s)]
*  from all the banking industry in New York and stuff that [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5821.92s)]
*  is all about keeping their tax rates, keeping that that damn [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5825.72s)]
*  14 percent tax, the tax investment funds, what it's called. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5830.16s)]
*  I'll forget the name in a second. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5835.04s)]

*  You know, I mean, which good do you want, which bad do you want? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5839.8s)]
*  You know, and we have to look for the balance of good. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5843.04s)]
*  I think, for instance, Joe Biden is a more [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5845.8s)]
*  populist oriented president for people, for Ma. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5849.2s)]
*  I mean, his his heart and sympathy runs to helping people, you know, versus, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5852.84s)]

*  Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5869.360000000001s)]
*  That's a good quote. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5872.0s)]
*  And don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5872.8s)]
*  I mean, I I've always had this philosophy [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5877.0s)]
*  that the best way to make the world a better place is to have less losers. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5880.88s)]
*  Right. How do you have less losers? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5884.64s)]
*  Give people a better chance. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5885.88s)]
*  Yeah. Give people a better opportunity. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5887.08s)]
*  And, you know, one of the things that's always frustrated me the most [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5889.88s)]
*  in this country is that we have all these places that are [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5892.92s)]
*  economically disenfranchised and filled with drugs and crime. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5895.8s)]
*  We've done very little to fix that. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5898.92s)]
*  Why? I ask you, I agree with you entirely. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5901.72s)]
*  Now ask yourself why money. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5904.8s)]
*  Yeah. And who's got the money? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5907.4400000000005s)]
*  Who does have the money? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5909.92s)]

*  You know, and I love it. I think it's great. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5930.48s)]
*  I mean, I think nothing you said reeks of greed. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5932.44s)]
*  Everything you said reeks of love and compassion. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5935.4s)]
*  And that's that's the best we could hope for, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5938.599999999999s)]
*  for someone who's lived as long as you have and had as many experiences you have. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5942.68s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to I don't claim to wear the hair shirt [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5947.5599999999995s)]

*  I live well. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5956.719999999999s)]
*  And I think all of us who are successful in [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5958.16s)]
*  American society get a chance to live really well. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5962.12s)]
*  And I think, though, we need to extend this compassion. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5966.08s)]
*  I think it's just human spirit. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5975.2s)]
*  Yeah, just a human spirit. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5976.5599999999995s)]
*  I just think that the fear that many people have is how is this going to be [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5978.16s)]
*  accomplished and how is it going to be allocated and how do we keep [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5981.92s)]
*  people from profiting off of this? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5985.52s)]
*  Philanthropic notion. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5990.16s)]
*  I don't think you can keep people from profiting. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5991.76s)]
*  And I don't think maybe stealing you can try, but still the same being profiting. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5994.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think what we need is [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=5999.92s)]
*  a much better regulated capitalist economy. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6002.96s)]
*  I think that capital is a wonderful way to harness the human spirit [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6007.08s)]
*  of for ambition and accomplishment and even and for personal wealth and gain, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6011.12s)]
*  which are all legitimate human feelings. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6015.56s)]
*  It's just it's gotten out of control. Right. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6017.96s)]
*  And that greed has become the driving force. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6020.08s)]
*  It is good. That was the 80s. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6022.92s)]
*  That was the cocaine era. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6024.4800000000005s)]
*  The Reagan decade. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6026.08s)]
*  Well, that's what we need. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6027.12s)]
*  We not like we need a new psychedelic era. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6027.76s)]
*  That's what we need. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6030.08s)]
*  The psychedelic mentality and the psychedelic mindset is total opposite. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6031.08s)]
*  I'm totally voting for you. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6035.76s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, tell me where to send the money. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6037.0s)]
*  I don't think we need to send money. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6040.12s)]
*  I think we need to send drugs. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6041.64s)]
*  I need to. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6043.16s)]
*  I think the legalization of psychedelics would go a long way [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6044.4s)]
*  to changing the way people view just community, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6048.24s)]
*  just the way the way we interact with each other, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6052.72s)]
*  the fact that we are supposed to be the United States of America [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6054.88s)]
*  supposed to be a community. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6058.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't think that you could take acid [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6060.12s)]
*  and be taken out onto the streets. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6063.24s)]
*  Where poor people live or into the ghettos [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6066.16s)]
*  and say ever say this is right. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6069.48s)]
*  I can go home and not think about not have this image in my mind. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6072.2s)]
*  I should help. I think I should be part of it. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6075.8s)]
*  And I totally agree. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6078.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, the big fear of the 60s when LSD came on, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6081.16s)]
*  that the authorities, they're going to spike the reservoir. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6084.2s)]
*  Yeah. Everybody in town is going to get stoned. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6087.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, let's do it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6089.28s)]
*  I don't know if we should do it involuntarily, of course. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6092.48s)]
*  But I think having it available to people to understand [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6095.12s)]
*  that there is a different way to look at the world [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6099.16s)]
*  and that you're on this ride for a short amount of time. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6100.96s)]
*  You know, you're you say you're 76. I'm 55. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6104.599999999999s)]
*  We you know, we don't have much time left. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6108.88s)]
*  It's a quick ride. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6111.24s)]
*  And you spend so much time just trying to accumulate numbers. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6112.639999999999s)]
*  And that doesn't help anybody. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6118.12s)]
*  It's not it's not what this thing is supposed to be all about. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6120.0s)]
*  And it doesn't enhance your experience on the ride, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6122.72s)]
*  which is really what it's supposed to be about. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6125.28s)]
*  The do our best to enhance the experience for ourselves and for others. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6127.24s)]
*  And when you're just trying to enhance it for yourself [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6131.599999999999s)]
*  and you're around other people that are doing that as well, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6134.04s)]
*  and that's all they concentrate and think about, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6136.16s)]
*  then that becomes the mentality that you operate under. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6138.28s)]
*  I think that's a real problem. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6141.84s)]
*  I don't think drugs are the only solution, but I think there's a [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6143.88s)]
*  there's a real pathway through psychedelics that allow people to understand [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6147.599999999999s)]
*  that you're just a part of a pattern and that this pattern is not mutually [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6152.679999999999s)]
*  beneficial and it's definitely not beneficial to people that are [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6156.92s)]
*  disenfranchised, it's not beneficial to people that are stuck in a bad situation. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6159.8s)]
*  And that the best way forward for everybody, including the wealthy, [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6165.28s)]
*  is to make the world a safer, happier, healthier place. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6169.0s)]
*  And what's the best way to do that? [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6173.36s)]
*  Well, definitely allocate more money towards fixing places [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6174.56s)]
*  that are traditionally disenfranchised and historically disenfranchised. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6179.04s)]
*  Well, this is I love to love to see that. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6184.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is I think is the the major challenge now of the age is is there two of them. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6187.12s)]
*  Climate change and disruption and how to how to deal with that [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6193.84s)]
*  and the economic distribution, fair distribution of wealth and [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6199.5199999999995s)]
*  who's going to get a share of these world our resources on the world. Right. And. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6205.36s)]
*  A dose of kindness. Yeah. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6210.639999999999s)]
*  And understanding and perception [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6213.56s)]
*  would be so beneficial for everybody. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6216.84s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's particularly, you know, there's a story of the guys [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6219.28s)]
*  to two partners who founded the duty free shops and airports around the world. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6224.4400000000005s)]
*  There are two partners in it. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6229.2s)]
*  And one who I know's family rent a little most lavish life and put on [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6230.72s)]

*  The partner you never heard from until three years ago. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6243.28s)]
*  He gave his entire share of it away. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6247.0s)]
*  He never gave any of you any of it away. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6250.96s)]

*  the guy gave it away, might be suicidal. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6262.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm not sure. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6264.52s)]

*  Or can't you look at Trump and say, you know, couldn't you say, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6279.4400000000005s)]
*  Donald or Mr. President, whatever you call him, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6282.92s)]
*  just do the right thing for these poor people are suffering down there. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6285.76s)]
*  You know, you know, you don't have you could let all these people out of jail, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6288.56s)]
*  by the way, you don't have to just let, you know, your political conspirators or, [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6291.360000000001s)]
*  you know, this. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6295.4800000000005s)]
*  Geez. And, you know, I think [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6297.16s)]
*  like I said, how do I express it? [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6301.24s)]
*  These are ideals I still believe in. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6304.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel I've tried my best. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6307.96s)]
*  I've done my part. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6310.16s)]
*  I'm off the stage now. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6312.32s)]
*  I still do what I can. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6315.24s)]
*  I'm happy now. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6317.28s)]
*  I feel grown up and no longer full of FOMO [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6318.839999999999s)]
*  or ambition to have more money or to achieve. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6323.04s)]
*  Did you have FOMO when you were young? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6326.48s)]
*  Oh, all of you know, we all live with. Yeah. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6327.96s)]
*  I mean, doesn't everybody feel they're not at the right party, you know? [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6330.96s)]
*  Or not at the right backstage or, you know, I mean, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6334.72s)]
*  I guess if you're in a social city, you feel a lot of FOMO, you know, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6338.84s)]
*  but you slowly overcome it. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6341.32s)]
*  But even if that was a glamorous situation, we should have been in, you know, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6343.12s)]
*  or if it wasn't there, it was some other situation. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6347.08s)]
*  It was pretty fantastic. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6350.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I should have gone. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6351.6s)]
*  You know, I don't know. I always had it. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6353.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not alone. FOMO people can call me for a friend. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6356.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but when someone look at you [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6361.8s)]
*  and all the experiences that you've had, like, oh, my God, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6363.240000000001s)]
*  how could you have missed out on anything? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6365.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. I I wanted to say that in the book because the book in part [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6367.120000000001s)]
*  is does look like a recitation of these fantastic places [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6371.280000000001s)]
*  and people I've met in vacations with people I've met in great concerts. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6375.360000000001s)]
*  I've seen just there's so much fun in the book. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6380.0s)]
*  And I wonder, I didn't quite capture that level of insecurity. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6383.08s)]
*  I'd always feel, you know, behind some of those things. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6388.16s)]
*  I wasn't at that backstage or somehow that [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6391.4s)]
*  it looks like is all kind of natural and easy. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6395.6s)]
*  It wasn't so natural and so easy. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6398.0s)]
*  But. It worked. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6401.0s)]
*  The no one would think of you as a person [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6405.44s)]
*  that would fear missing out on anything. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6410.44s)]
*  I mean, well, yeah, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6413.64s)]
*  hearing you talk about these times and talk about what you've been through [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6417.04s)]
*  and talk about what you've experienced and starting Rolling Stone [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6420.44s)]
*  being a part of them, being at the helm of one of the biggest [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6424.64s)]
*  engines for cultural change this country seen in the last 30, 40 years. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6428.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, it was a hell of a ride. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6434.28s)]
*  I mean, it was so much fun. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6436.56s)]
*  And to see these places to hang with the most talented rock artists [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6438.320000000001s)]
*  our time and go to the White House and sit in the Oval Office [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6442.92s)]
*  and interview the president and try and grill them as best you can [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6446.6s)]
*  and just feel you're a part of that. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6449.88s)]
*  But you don't know that when it's happening, you know, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6452.72s)]
*  it's only when you look back at the end and put it all together [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6456.360000000001s)]
*  do you realize, Jesus, I was at that point and that place and that plan. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6459.76s)]
*  How it looks and it seems sort of, you know, you didn't realize at the time [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6463.2s)]
*  how crazy it was for you to be where you were and do what you were doing. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6467.08s)]
*  No. Really? No. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6470.92s)]
*  What did you think it was normal? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6473.4s)]
*  What did you think it was? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6475.12s)]
*  I did never. I never gave it that much. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6476.68s)]
*  Something I wanted. I was ambitious to do. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6479.52s)]
*  I was excited about going to the White House or working with Hunter [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6481.32s)]
*  or we're going to the Stones concert tonight or listening to this record. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6484.16s)]
*  But it either came so easy [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6488.12s)]
*  or there was so much of it that [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6492.6s)]
*  I never thought, I mean, I think, oh, man, having the time of my life, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6496.04s)]
*  I said, I can't believe I'd be places listening to music would make me cry. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6500.6s)]
*  It was that special. But I. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6504.92s)]
*  I never thought, oh, I'm at the one world shaking event here. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6508.04s)]
*  Oh, my God, I'm so lucky. I'm special. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6511.84s)]
*  I never thought of that. Not special, but fortunate. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6514.0s)]
*  Fortunate. Yes. Yeah, it's fortunate. Yeah. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6516.6s)]
*  I mean, clearly, but undeniably fortunate. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6519.08s)]
*  Then you think. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6523.72s)]
*  It becomes. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6528.4800000000005s)]
*  Never less than special, but it comes more. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6531.04s)]
*  Predictable, you get to be a little more jaded. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6534.8s)]
*  Jaded is how long you're more used to it. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6538.360000000001s)]
*  You know, you're you're less each time is less start point. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6540.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6544.12s)]
*  But if I hadn't been to a place for a year and also think, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6544.8s)]
*  was it the Bruce show? [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6547.88s)]
*  I would be I believe I would be going out of my mind, you know, with. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6550.04s)]
*  And I still go out of my. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6554.88s)]
*  Where is the blue show? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6556.4400000000005s)]
*  But I get to see a lot of them. So. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6557.320000000001s)]
*  The I know I still thought like, am I like selling, you know, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6561.76s)]
*  showing up at all these places like the invisible men [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6565.240000000001s)]
*  or like in Forrest Gump and he's always at the right next to Johnson [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6568.64s)]
*  or something like that. I think it's like that a little. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6571.8s)]
*  I mean, once when Jerry Brown was running for president, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6574.679999999999s)]
*  he was using our office in New York for for his headquarters, the convention. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6578.28s)]
*  He was going to win that thing. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6581.48s)]
*  But I went down to the convention and with him and stand on the podium, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6582.639999999999s)]
*  you know, with him as he's giving a speech and then stay on. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6588.92s)]
*  He leaves. I stay on the podium for a while. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6591.08s)]
*  What Clinton comes on stuff like that wasn't allowed to be there. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6593.24s)]
*  I kept my backstage pass, which they take away from me on your stage pass, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6596.08s)]
*  which they take away from you as soon as you're done. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6600.5199999999995s)]
*  They want stage, but I end up staying there for an hour or two hours. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6602.92s)]
*  I think, wow, this is amazing. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6605.84s)]
*  You know, what a place to be or be in the campaign trailer [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6607.56s)]
*  with the Carter people at the moment. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6611.72s)]
*  He goes to the top of the nomination. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6613.400000000001s)]
*  They're passing out cigars. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6615.4400000000005s)]
*  And I know I'm in some place special, right? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6616.56s)]
*  Get them to sign the cigar thing and going, wow, you know, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6618.52s)]
*  how can I be at that? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6622.56s)]
*  I once or on the other side, like [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6624.32s)]
*  one year after the Academy Awards, that the party afterwards, a small party, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6627.8s)]
*  Michael Jackson comes in and sits next to me, says that we start chatting [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6632.719999999999s)]
*  because I had some other business with him. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6636.2s)]
*  And then Madonna comes in, she sits down. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6638.96s)]
*  She wants to chat with my sister, sits down on my knee, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6641.36s)]
*  which is she works out hard, by the way, is not fun [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6645.599999999999s)]
*  when she sits on your quadriceps. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6648.96s)]
*  You know, you're dense. She is dense. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6651.2s)]
*  So I like going to. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6655.28s)]
*  Well, this is history. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6656.32s)]
*  I should say, listen to everything that Michael and Madonna. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6657.2s)]
*  Your leg hurts. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6660.12s)]
*  My leg hurts. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6660.96s)]
*  And my will is be over. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6662.48s)]
*  You know, but still, it ought to be amazing. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6664.64s)]
*  It was amazing. God, I mean, just hearing these stories is amazing. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6666.64s)]
*  But I would imagine that being you while you were there, it's hard [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6671.04s)]
*  to imagine someone else viewing this and seeing how. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6675.32s)]
*  I mean, while you're there, just it's life. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6680.599999999999s)]
*  That's your life. You become accustomed to it. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6683.08s)]
*  Yeah. And so it seems normal to all of a sudden be having dinner with Michael Jackson. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6684.92s)]
*  You know, that's bizarre. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6689.48s)]
*  And it is. But and you talk about afterwards, you're dumb. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6690.799999999999s)]
*  Like he was actually. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6694.12s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know him that well. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6697.16s)]
*  He would wanted to do an interview with me. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6699.0s)]
*  And I thought, well, of course, he hasn't given an interview. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6702.12s)]
*  And I'll do it. It's not my cup of tea. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6705.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not what I know a lot about. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6707.36s)]
*  And furthermore, I don't know what there is to say with Michael Jackson. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6710.32s)]
*  You know what he's going to say. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6712.799999999999s)]
*  But I spent all this time. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6714.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, so to do the interview, he wanted to meet me first. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6717.12s)]
*  So we had dinner and he brought all his loan chef. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6719.320000000001s)]
*  It was his manager's house table set for two of us in the private room. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6723.240000000001s)]
*  Just you and Michael Jackson and Michael and his cook serves him. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6726.72s)]
*  So he wanted to do this. He was. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6730.160000000001s)]
*  Or you could interview him. Yeah. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6731.76s)]
*  He wanted me to interview me first to make sure I was cool. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6733.08s)]
*  You know, were you going to interview? Yeah. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6736.68s)]
*  And I didn't particularly want to. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6739.0s)]
*  But he insisted on me doing it, not because not because he think [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6740.160000000001s)]
*  I probably think I knew anything more than anybody. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6743.76s)]
*  But since I was the editor and owner, then it would make him more special. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6745.68s)]
*  Be right. More reflective of his glory. Unusual. Yeah. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6749.64s)]
*  So he was very nice and polite. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6753.76s)]
*  And he really is curious and smart. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6755.320000000001s)]
*  And every meeting and he's very soft spoken. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6758.04s)]
*  And everything is wonderful. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6760.6s)]
*  That's so sweet. You know, and. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6762.12s)]
*  You talk like that. So. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6764.92s)]
*  So he's set up. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6767.68s)]
*  So he agreed to do the interview, which he suggested. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6769.08s)]
*  Then I get a call saying, and I spent a week [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6771.88s)]
*  and studying and listening to every record and reading everything. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6774.36s)]
*  Then I got this from his manager. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6777.2s)]
*  Is it OK if you do it in the dark? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6779.44s)]
*  Michael would like to maybe do it at night to interview and maybe do it [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6781.28s)]
*  about the fireplace. There'll be no lights on just candles in the fireplace. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6784.88s)]
*  Would that be OK? Sure. Of course, I'll be OK. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6788.24s)]
*  Why not? So then a week before the interview is to take place, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6792.16s)]
*  he goes, well, Michael's too scared to do the interview. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6797.24s)]
*  Doesn't want to do it. So they cancel. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6800.12s)]
*  Now, remember this man, he never gave he gave some. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6802.88s)]
*  Where was this? [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6805.48s)]
*  It was the year I it was. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6807.16s)]
*  Nineties, 2000s, maybe 2000s. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6810.76s)]
*  OK, so this is post thriller. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6813.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Was this before the allegations? [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6815.8s)]
*  It was before. Yes, it was before the allegations. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6819.28s)]
*  There was rumors around about it. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6821.44s)]
*  But this would be that he was still in the hyperbaric chamber [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6822.92s)]
*  pet monkey stage. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6826.5199999999995s)]
*  He had gone into the extreme plastic surgery. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6827.84s)]
*  And he hadn't gone through that boy scout phase. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6831.4s)]
*  Let's call it the boy scout. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6833.8s)]
*  So he changed his mind. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6836.28s)]
*  So, I mean, that's fine. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6837.6s)]
*  I didn't know what he was going to say anyway. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6839.04s)]
*  But so then I got invited. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6840.96s)]
*  Then as it comes, he invited me to the Elizabeth Taylor wedding [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6844.72s)]
*  that he had on his ranch, Neverland Ranch to attend that. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6848.04s)]
*  And me and my wife went up for that and had a great day. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6851.44s)]
*  And it was this wild wedding, you know, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6853.92s)]
*  celebrity wedding, helicopter, so I get around. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6855.96s)]
*  Somebody in a parachute, you know, flew in to crash the wedding [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6858.12s)]
*  and dropped in all of a sudden afterwards. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6861.92s)]
*  He took me on a tour from a parachute, just a random person, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6863.76s)]
*  a random person jumped out a plane above the wedding, which is outside. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6866.88s)]
*  They had balloons hanging, you know, streaming up in the air [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6871.28s)]
*  to keep planes and helicopters away. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6873.84s)]
*  They had balloons up a half a mile and trying to block the airspace. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6876.04s)]
*  And this guy in a parachute comes and lands [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6879.64s)]
*  right in the middle of the wedding. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6883.88s)]
*  You know, and then he hustled them out, of course. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6886.32s)]
*  The upshot was after wedding. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6889.2s)]
*  He gave me a private tour of Neverland and his little, you know, ferris wheel. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6890.5599999999995s)]
*  So whose wedding was this? Elizabeth Taylor. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6894.84s)]
*  Which number? I think this is number seven. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6897.04s)]
*  This was the truck driver she met in rehab, Larry Fartansky. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6899.719999999999s)]
*  But so, I mean, Michael's polite, nice, you know, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6904.759999999999s)]
*  but he obviously has extremely difficult dark side. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6909.0s)]
*  I mean, oh, yeah. So there you go. Wow. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6913.04s)]
*  So that's me. And what year is that, Jamie? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6916.84s)]
*  Ninety one. It says 91. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6918.44s)]
*  That's a two. So there I am in the back. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6920.0s)]
*  Yeah. See, just to the left of Michael. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6923.32s)]
*  I sat at a table with Marianne Williamson, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6927.28s)]
*  the one who just ran for president last time. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6930.4s)]
*  It was a strange way. Nancy Reagan was there. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6933.44s)]
*  Did you have a conversation with him afterwards to try to assure him? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6935.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that, you know, you didn't have to worry about this interview. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6938.8s)]
*  No, because I was frankly relieved. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6942.96s)]
*  Really? Yes, because as good as you are at this, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6947.16s)]
*  you would have you would not be able to crack him. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6951.36s)]
*  And part of it is that obviously inside he's so tight and tense [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6954.599999999999s)]
*  because he's concealing this other thing, you know, this, you know, thing with boys. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6959.36s)]
*  And it's it's obviously driving him. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6963.16s)]
*  He's learned how to guard himself like so much. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6965.32s)]
*  So it's a thing. And also, I honestly don't think he had much to say. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6968.32s)]
*  He'd been in show business since he was four singing. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6973.28s)]
*  He was there's nothing indicating he was any kind of intellectual [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6977.24s)]
*  or had anything to say about politics. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6980.36s)]
*  I mean, everything was. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6982.5199999999995s)]
*  All about his show business. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6985.32s)]
*  But even that alone would be fascinating [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6986.759999999999s)]
*  just to try to get into the mindset of a person that's living [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6989.32s)]
*  this very, very unusual life. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6993.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, to say that he didn't have anything to say, he's a human being [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6996.36s)]
*  that's experiencing something that no one, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=6999.12s)]
*  no one will ever understand because this is pre Internet. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7001.68s)]
*  This is he was one of the biggest stars the world had ever seen. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7005.04s)]
*  Let me give you let me give you an example. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7008.76s)]
*  If I said to him, well, really legitimate questions. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7011.04s)]
*  OK, what is what was it like to be a child star? [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7013.88s)]
*  And at age seven, have your father manage you and telling you what to do. Right. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7017.8s)]
*  He would then have to open up to the answer. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7022.08s)]
*  He either do one or two things. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7024.64s)]
*  In my scenario, he would say, oh, it's wonderful. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7026.56s)]
*  We had such a wonderful time of giant privilege [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7029.48s)]
*  and we had the opportunity to travel around the world. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7032.719999999999s)]
*  My dad was a loving, wonderful thing. All bullshit. Right. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7034.799999999999s)]
*  Or the legitimate answer, which I don't think you get out of it, [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7038.36s)]
*  which is it was tough. Our dad beat us. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7041.04s)]
*  We didn't have school life. I had no friends. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7044.4s)]
*  I was constantly on the bus with this, that and the other thing. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7047.28s)]
*  That's the truth. That would be interesting. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7049.719999999999s)]
*  He'd explore his feelings. He wouldn't. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7051.799999999999s)]
*  I swear to you, I don't think you would have gone there. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7053.799999999999s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7056.2s)]
*  Before doing any research, I called up Diana Ross, who I know, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7058.36s)]
*  and said, come to lunch. Let's have lunch. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7063.44s)]
*  I want to talk to you about Michael, because I'm going back to do it. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7065.4s)]
*  This interview, I want to pick it. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7068.5199999999995s)]
*  Now, the room, the word, the story, the official story, Motown, [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7069.48s)]
*  she discovered the Jackson family in Ohio and no excuse me, in Indiana [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7073.08s)]
*  and brought the attention of Barry Gordy [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7079.36s)]
*  and was kind of like a mother figure to him. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7083.839999999999s)]
*  So Diana says, you know, that was all a lie. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7086.88s)]
*  That's not true. I didn't discover it. I've never been there. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7090.32s)]
*  I barely know him. In fact, you know, I mean, I I wanted [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7093.0s)]
*  I tried to look him up a couple of years ago, and I went to the ranch [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7097.8s)]
*  to see him and I had to sit around for two hours and finally just left. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7101.32s)]
*  He had no this giant man. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7106.56s)]
*  It was a giant myth, you know, and and Michael, [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7109.04s)]
*  I think was leaving this giant myth. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7113.68s)]
*  I mean, and he had to believe that his relationship with boys was entirely innocent, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7116.0s)]
*  which it wasn't. Did you see that documentary on him? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7121.2s)]
*  No, I tried not to because not a happy documentary. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7125.16s)]
*  And this is from the victims. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not happy. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7128.6s)]
*  Did you read any of the stuff that the doctor who went to jail for [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7133.24s)]
*  and esthetizing him that, you know, when he died, [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7140.24s)]
*  that the doctor said that he was chemically castrated by his father [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7143.4s)]
*  and that that was, you know, you know about [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7147.08s)]
*  these young boys that were taken into the opera [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7152.0s)]
*  and turned into castratos. Yeah. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7157.36s)]
*  That that was how Michael preserved his voice, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7160.2s)]
*  that he was chemically castrated when he was younger. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7163.44s)]
*  And that's why he had that very high pitched voice and no muscle mass. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7165.639999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it was essentially he was a eunuch. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7169.799999999999s)]
*  And that that was you've heard castratos sing. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7173.12s)]
*  Yeah, I am very familiar with the whole sound. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7176.04s)]
*  There's only a few recorded recordings from castratos, [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7179.48s)]
*  but that was a practice that they would take young boys and castrate them [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7183.24s)]
*  to preserve their voice and raise them through this singing. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7187.599999999999s)]
*  And that that was what gave Michael Jackson that incredibly feminine, [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7192.96s)]
*  but yet also very unusual voice. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7197.76s)]
*  He had a beautiful, astounding voice. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7200.639999999999s)]
*  Astounding. I mean, some of you said, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7202.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, should she is a proper listen to Michael Jackson's music today? [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7204.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I mean, knowing I just say, of course, he was one of the genius artists. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7207.919999999999s)]
*  But what good does it do you to deprive yourself of his music? [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7211.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, anyway, is it possible? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7215.48s)]
*  I suppose I don't I've not really I think I've heard that before. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7218.639999999999s)]
*  How would a. Guy in Jackson, Indiana, Jackson, [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7223.24s)]
*  you know, Gary, Indiana, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7229.92s)]
*  Jack Michael's father, Joe Jackson, get his hands on [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7231.72s)]
*  the materials and know how I don't think it hard castrate. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7236.400000000001s)]
*  How would you get it? How would you do it? [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7239.64s)]
*  You would get it from the way they chemically castrate sex offenders [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7240.8s)]
*  the way they do. You're right. Yeah. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7244.56s)]
*  I think the mechanism was well known, especially I suppose. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7246.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. OK. Especially to an incredibly wealthy person [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7250.4800000000005s)]
*  that have a lot to gain by enacting that if you have the financial mechanism, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7253.0s)]
*  like if you think about like what is what is powering the Jackson five, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7259.56s)]
*  what's powering Michael Jackson's career, it's his voice [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7263.360000000001s)]
*  and the voice that was developed when he was very young. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7265.92s)]
*  You know, you go listen to ABC or listen to some of the, you know, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7268.6s)]
*  tiny little boys. Yeah. So fragile. Yeah. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7272.52s)]
*  But I mean, like listen to human nature. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7276.56s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't sound like any man that you've ever heard sing a song. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7278.56s)]
*  It's not a falsetto. Yeah. It's a different thing. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7282.400000000001s)]
*  It's like there's a there's a power to his voice. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7285.32s)]
*  It's extremely unusual. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7288.16s)]
*  Well, I am not really given that lot of thought, but I [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7290.8s)]
*  it's very it's plausible. It's absolutely plausible. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7294.88s)]
*  I think you could have gotten something out of talking to him. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7297.12s)]
*  How? Excuse me. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7300.0s)]
*  I hear that you're a castrata. Can I see? [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7301.4s)]
*  No, I wouldn't say that. What would you say? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7304.08s)]
*  You wouldn't say that you just you just I mean, I think the way you get a person [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7305.88s)]
*  like that to reveal themselves is through time. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7310.719999999999s)]
*  You would have to have a long conversation with them and then inconsistencies. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7314.4s)]
*  And you would you would, you know, you chip away at the veneer [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7318.2s)]
*  and you'd probably find something at the very least. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7322.36s)]
*  Personally, you would get an experience with a very, very unusual human being [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7325.76s)]
*  that that is going through a life that no one will ever understand, because [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7330.32s)]
*  it's like Elvis, the Beatles is a few people in human history [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7335.24s)]
*  that have achieved that level of of fame and notoriety and popularity. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7339.28s)]
*  And, you know, we're talking about being captured by fame. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7346.08s)]
*  I mean, who the fuck was captured by fame more than Michael Jackson? [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7349.92s)]
*  Well, what what what human beings will ever experience [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7354.4s)]
*  what that guy has experienced? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7357.719999999999s)]
*  Well, you're of course right about that. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7360.08s)]
*  I I don't think that Michael was accessible to to [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7363.36s)]
*  a normal or even a long thing. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7369.76s)]
*  I mean, again, you only get three or four hours [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7371.679999999999s)]
*  with these things where you come back because you've been friendly. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7373.96s)]
*  But then you get I don't I don't think that time. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7376.0s)]
*  I just don't think you could have broken, Michael. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7379.4s)]
*  I don't think you'd have to break them. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7381.48s)]
*  I don't think you just have to let them talk. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7382.679999999999s)]
*  I don't think you would have done it. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7384.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you would get something in him not opening up. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7386.599999999999s)]
*  You would get something in him just the way he communicates. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7389.48s)]
*  Maybe, you know, I mean, I certainly got a sense of it [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7393.5199999999995s)]
*  in the way our own communications were that he [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7396.52s)]
*  wasn't going to open. But [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7400.96s)]
*  but even in not opening, you get something you get. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7405.240000000001s)]
*  You get a window into this human being that is living [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7408.92s)]
*  an one singular life that no one will ever understand. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7413.84s)]
*  Well, if I certainly had that list of questions, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7418.360000000001s)]
*  I certainly had all those things because I thought that growing up part [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7421.0s)]
*  was the most fascinating of them. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7423.8s)]
*  Yeah. And the early experiences that early fame [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7425.0s)]
*  because that that you don't get talked to. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7428.64s)]
*  When I did John Lennon in another long and a long, long interview, I didn't. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7430.76s)]
*  Was the first interview he ever gave after the Beatles broke [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7436.84s)]
*  from the first long interview ever gave. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7440.400000000001s)]
*  He was full of pain. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7444.72s)]
*  You know, I mean, it was. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7446.88s)]
*  You didn't say you didn't have to say anything. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7450.320000000001s)]
*  He was just spewing it all out. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7451.96s)]
*  And he was so angry about the way fame had treated him. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7454.4s)]
*  I mean, that they had been trapped, you know, in this bubble. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7459.28s)]
*  And he said, yeah. But inside it was like orgies and whores and junk. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7462.36s)]
*  And, you know, the story has never been told of what happened. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7466.08s)]
*  He wanted to, you know, spill that confinement. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7469.12s)]
*  I want out, out, out, out, out. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7471.84s)]
*  And that was a wholly different experience. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7473.64s)]
*  You know, so I don't think Michael, [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7478.96s)]
*  he wanted to he knew if he revealed himself [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7483.44s)]
*  as he did, like Posey naked on the for the two versions [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7486.44s)]
*  on which we ran in Rolling Stone, him and the old Coyd Naked [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7490.44s)]
*  was a way of getting out of this trap of fame, saying, oh, well, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7494.32s)]
*  we're the most famous couple in the world and the biggest pop star. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7497.84s)]
*  Well, but you know what? We're ordinary people like you and me. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7500.56s)]
*  We are ordinary naked people. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7503.68s)]
*  We don't we're not, you know, unusually great looking. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7505.4s)]
*  We're just average. How do you and me? [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7508.44s)]
*  How did John feel trapped? [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7510.08s)]
*  Like when you were talking to him about it, he couldn't do what he wanted to do. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7511.5599999999995s)]
*  He wanted to. He was a man of lots of opinions and ideas and politics [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7514.839999999999s)]
*  and ideas about peace and art. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7518.919999999999s)]
*  And he had to be a beetle for all those times. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7521.5599999999995s)]
*  And so he's for five years taking drugs, taking acid, smoking pot, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7525.0s)]
*  going to India, Maharashi, Meen and Rishi meditating. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7531.12s)]
*  And he can't say anything about it. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7534.639999999999s)]
*  He can't tell the world, I've got other vision of things. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7537.08s)]
*  I've got the way that we need peace or whatever. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7540.4s)]
*  But ultimately did, right? [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7542.8s)]
*  Ultimately, he did. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7544.12s)]
*  And part of it was through that interview, he just decided to burst [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7545.16s)]
*  the whole thing wide open. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7548.92s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to live with this anymore. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7550.68s)]

*  He posed without his clothes on for the cover of Rolling Stone. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7572.5199999999995s)]
*  Not a full funnel, but he did that to get out of it, to get out of it, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7577.5599999999995s)]
*  because he was a genuine musician, wanted to be a musician and in a rock band. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7580.8s)]
*  Instead, opportunity knocked and made him a TV teenage TV star [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7584.8s)]

*  ABC wanted him off the air and he was free. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7605.64s)]
*  There was no other way he could get out of it. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7608.92s)]
*  Otherwise, he was contractually bound for five more years of being a teen idol. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7610.64s)]
*  So they kicked him off the show for posing naked on the cover. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7615.0s)]
*  Yeah, really? Yeah. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7618.52s)]

*  Things are way different than now. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7624.08s)]
*  You can't go on TV. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7626.88s)]
*  And did you talk to him about this feeling of being captured by fame? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7627.88s)]
*  No, I didn't. I mean, I didn't do the interviews with him. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7633.28s)]
*  I got to know him later and liked him, but I didn't do that with him. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7635.8s)]
*  But it's clear now what we did run that he just [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7639.12s)]
*  this is just not what he wanted to do with his life. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7642.6s)]
*  I mean, he had to live in a hotel surrounded by security. Yeah. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7644.400000000001s)]

*  But he broke the fame spell. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7651.96s)]
*  And I think John did, too. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7655.96s)]
*  And I think that Michael couldn't have just. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7658.2s)]
*  Do you think he was just too captured by it? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7661.88s)]
*  I think that if he is too weird, if there was he put one chink in that armor [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7664.16s)]
*  of his. It would have led to the he feared that it would lead [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7669.0s)]

*  But I mean, I mean, this parallels [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7786.76s)]
*  to what we're talking about with Hunter and and many people [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7789.4400000000005s)]

*  Because they became famous because of this uniqueness. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7797.72s)]
*  And then they get captured by that. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7801.6s)]
*  And then the public demands. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7803.8s)]

*  I mean, it bothers me going out in public and, you know, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7829.04s)]
*  the sometimes sometimes it gets hassling and sometimes people [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7832.4400000000005s)]
*  just don't leave you alone. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7835.360000000001s)]

*  it's like the way you handle any other drug. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7842.240000000001s)]

*  How do you take those steps? [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7851.6s)]
*  I mean, you've been you've been being famous for a long time now. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7852.76s)]

*  Well, fortunately, I'm famous for just being me, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7875.04s)]
*  which is kind of a different thing. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7877.84s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I'm saying, like, I just talk. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7880.6s)]
*  And have opinions and have conversations with people or to stand up [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7882.84s)]
*  or whatever I'm doing. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7886.56s)]
*  It's just me, you know, which is a different thing. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7887.92s)]
*  You know, I don't have a persona necessarily. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7891.72s)]
*  I'm not I'm not like putting on an act. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7894.6s)]
*  It's just me. And the pressures of it, I kind of mitigate [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7897.08s)]
*  with physical exercise and making my the things that I do on purpose [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7901.84s)]
*  far more difficult because it makes the rest of life easier. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7907.96s)]
*  But I do it purposely consciously. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7911.96s)]
*  So that's a very interesting. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7915.84s)]
*  I mean, as much as performers. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7917.92s)]
*  And writers are doing what they do and are there being me. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7920.64s)]
*  They are also people in the case of 100 to wearing a mask. Right. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7925.04s)]
*  You know, so Michael Jackson's wearing a mask. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7929.08s)]
*  Yeah, he's got that mask. I mean. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7931.5599999999995s)]
*  If he. And you you don't you you won't wear it. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7935.96s)]
*  I mean, that's probably where the contradiction starts [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7940.84s)]
*  and the thing you always have to deal with and fight with yourself. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7943.6s)]
*  And suddenly you realize the mask is more attractive than you, maybe. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7946.52s)]
*  Exactly. And then you you've got to be that. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7949.68s)]
*  Then you have to put on a persona. Yeah. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7952.320000000001s)]
*  I'm very fortunate and I don't I don't have that trap. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7955.04s)]
*  That's what's lucky. Joe, you need a mask. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7959.08s)]
*  What kind of mask? I don't know. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7961.320000000001s)]

*  Tell me you don't need a mask. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7976.72s)]
*  I don't. But why? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7978.92s)]
*  No, I just as a joke, you know, just as a I mean, I think you [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7979.76s)]
*  from what I can see, you seem to have it pretty not in terms of the way you live, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7984.160000000001s)]
*  what you do. I mean, what? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7988.64s)]
*  I'm an interviewer as well as other things. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7991.200000000001s)]
*  And what a thing to be able to do. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7993.92s)]
*  Yeah. Live nearby and then start bringing interesting people. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7995.8s)]
*  It's awesome. Yeah, I love it. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=7998.88s)]
*  It's satisfying. You're not too. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8001.28s)]
*  You're not putting on anything particularly, you know, you're no. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8004.2s)]
*  I'm trying very hard to not. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8007.320000000001s)]
*  It's very conscious, though. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8009.64s)]
*  What's underneath that Joe Rogan mask, though? [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8010.84s)]
*  No, I don't have a mask. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8013.28s)]
*  I swear to God. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8015.28s)]
*  I mean, maybe I should know. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8016.16s)]
*  But, you know, I think psychedelics have helped me tremendously [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8022.0s)]
*  in not having a mask, you know, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8025.68s)]
*  and the way to connect with people is also to not have a mask. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8027.56s)]
*  I think if you did this over our I mean, I've done thousands of these [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8031.400000000001s)]
*  hours and hours of conversations, if I had a mask, it would have come off. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8034.6s)]
*  You know, I know that's what my point was about talking to Michael Jackson. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8038.96s)]
*  I think if you did sit down with him for long enough, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8043.6s)]
*  you would at least get an understanding of like [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8046.320000000001s)]
*  just the way he communicates, the way he answers questions, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8049.320000000001s)]
*  the way he deals with situations, the way you just talk to him about the world [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8052.4400000000005s)]
*  itself, talk to him about things outside of himself, how he views things. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8056.36s)]
*  You get a sense of how bizarre the journey he's on is, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8060.599999999999s)]
*  like because he's you know, he's in some bizarre rocket ship [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8064.839999999999s)]
*  and some uncharted part of the universe. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8068.36s)]
*  But what is it? What do you think when somebody says to you? [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8070.839999999999s)]
*  Or if I came in here and said, Joe, I really want to do your show and all that stuff. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8073.719999999999s)]
*  But do you mind if we turn all the lights off and you can't see me? [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8078.28s)]
*  And there'll be some candles on the side. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8082.0s)]
*  Does that make me I mean, doesn't it sound like this man doesn't want to be seen? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8083.2s)]
*  He's this man hiding very uncomfortable. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8088.5199999999995s)]
*  I would imagine that he's very uncomfortable and he's just terrified. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8091.2s)]
*  I don't even see my facial expressions. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8094.24s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, before he was here, he's already having some plastic surgery, right? [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8096.44s)]
*  He probably had some distorted perception of his appearance. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8101.44s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, just the whole world watching you in that way [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8106.36s)]
*  is going to be very fucking strange to be this young boy who grew up in a completely abnormal way. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8111.16s)]
*  But he never I had a normal life growing up. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8118.4s)]
*  Pretty normal. You know, I mean, normal for me. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8120.72s)]
*  I mean, not extraordinary. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8124.0s)]
*  And for him, everything's extraordinary from the beginning. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8126.5599999999995s)]
*  I know, you know, through this, I've I met all kinds of performers and artists and singers. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8131.08s)]
*  Some are good friends. Some, I know, casually. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8135.76s)]
*  I've seen a lot of performances and they're all. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8139.56s)]
*  Involved with. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8143.4800000000005s)]
*  Their their image, you know, and how they present themselves to the public and versus who they really are. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8145.88s)]
*  And you know, you've seen all kinds of. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8153.92s)]
*  Combinations, you know, people are just dying to kind of. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8157.68s)]
*  Expose themselves and talk a lot and think a lot and be valuable and. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8162.120000000001s)]
*  I, for instance, mono is, you know, just nonstop talking, you know, and open about everything, [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8166.12s)]
*  you know, his love, his wife, his kid, everything there is. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8172.5599999999995s)]
*  And and then you meet others like, say, like Bruce or Mick, who don't like talking about. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8176.32s)]
*  Well, Mick doesn't like talking about himself, in fact, refuses to feel so overexposed. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8186.04s)]
*  I think it's his way of protecting himself. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8192.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think he is or he is his way of keeping people away from him. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8194.8s)]
*  Yeah, not exposing. I mean, I think he's a man and knows believes in the advantages of mystery and show business. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8199.6s)]
*  I always keep him wondering. And, you know, but he's very British and then and Brits don't like to, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8206.64s)]
*  you know, talk about their feelings about themselves. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8212.48s)]
*  And yet he's, you know, very social, social individual. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8215.44s)]
*  Bruce, one of the greatest performers of all times. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8220.52s)]
*  And on the stage, he pours his heart out, you know, lifts you up, makes you cry. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8223.52s)]
*  Just just every conceivable thing communicates joy beyond belief is, I think, to me, the. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8230.6s)]
*  I've never seen anybody so happy on that stage as Bruce. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8239.16s)]
*  But to me, I just love watching more than anybody. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8242.76s)]
*  But, you know, on the other hand, he's reserved, quiet, not shy, but almost shy. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8245.800000000001s)]
*  He he holds himself back. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8255.76s)]
*  He again doesn't want he is very private. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8258.880000000001s)]
*  He doesn't like to reveal all the things he's, you know, even down the silly stuff like that. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8262.640000000001s)]
*  He's working on an album. He doesn't want anybody to know that he's working on a new album. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8267.16s)]
*  He'll tell you about two months later. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8270.36s)]
*  But being honest, he's not going to tell you about it. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8271.76s)]
*  He'll tell you about two months later. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8273.880000000001s)]
*  But meantime, it's oh, America. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8275.2s)]
*  You know, you can't, you know, this this. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8276.960000000001s)]
*  Yet one of the smartest, most thoughtful people in this. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8280.52s)]
*  Performer who. Has gathered audiences that. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8285.28s)]
*  Worship the cults, I mean, is beyond anything the. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8291.32s)]
*  And yet at home. Quiet. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8296.52s)]
*  Maybe that's because the way he expresses himself is through his art. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8301.640000000001s)]
*  He doesn't feel the need to express himself in any other way. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8305.800000000001s)]
*  And that whatever his thoughts are and his feelings about things come through in his songs. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8309.36s)]
*  I wrote in my book, the truest Bruce I've ever seen is on stage. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8313.960000000001s)]
*  That's the true Bruce. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8320.04s)]
*  Well, maybe that's the best way to do it for him. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8321.2s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and maybe he's preserving his talent. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8323.16s)]
*  He doesn't want to just use up some of that Indian mojo. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8326.4s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8330.52s)]
*  Spilling it in the living room. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8331.8s)]
*  And also, you know, maybe there's a sense of uncertainty about his thoughts and opinions [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8335.32s)]
*  and the way he sort of solidifies them is by the music and is through his art. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8340.119999999999s)]
*  You know, there's something to be said for that. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8346.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he takes his music more seriously than about anybody I've ever met. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8348.16s)]
*  I mean, I'll take it. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8353.76s)]
*  But he's got a fucking incredible catalog. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8355.119999999999s)]
*  What what he's saying through his music. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8357.6s)]
*  Yeah. So serious. Yeah. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8359.519999999999s)]
*  He's got a new record coming up next week, I think, which is unbelievable. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8362.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And it's Bruce doing covers, not his own material, but doing [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8366.08s)]
*  covers of soul music from about the 70s, the Commodores and the Childlights, Motown stuff. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8371.519999999999s)]
*  And in modern arranger, the same arrangers, he recognizes the song immediately. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8377.4s)]
*  You know, but he's singing it so powerfully. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8382.08s)]
*  There's so much fun in that record and so much passion that record. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8385.72s)]
*  And he's never pushed his voice before. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8388.759999999998s)]
*  Beyond his own lyrics and what he's trying to say about things, [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8393.08s)]
*  these more simple songs that are beautiful songs, but express [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8396.679999999998s)]
*  the deep universal things about love and losing love. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8401.24s)]
*  And my girl doesn't love me anymore. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8404.16s)]
*  My girl does love me. And, you know, you lied to me. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8406.48s)]
*  You know, right. You said that you lied. You lied. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8409.48s)]
*  You know, is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise? [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8412.12s)]
*  This is great. That's great. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8417.2s)]
*  Fuckin song. Yeah. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8418.560000000001s)]
*  And they hear Patty sing it with them. Yeah. Boy. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8419.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Honestly, I mean, [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8424.6s)]
*  knowing Bruce is well is like really one of the great honors [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8427.720000000001s)]
*  and privileges of my life. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8432.76s)]
*  I think he's that he's one of the most thoughtful people I've ever met. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8434.84s)]
*  And, you know, just privilege. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8439.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of genius. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8443.84s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's probably how he preserves it. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8445.84s)]
*  You know, the way he preserves that magic is to by releasing it through his art. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8449.84s)]
*  You know, maybe that's why he's reserved. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8454.2s)]
*  I mean, he did a podcast with Obama. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8456.12s)]
*  You ever hear that? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8459.32s)]
*  I did a podcast. Sucked. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8460.800000000001s)]
*  I just wasn't it wasn't there was nothing that they weren't loose enough. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8463.08s)]
*  Wasn't enough there. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8468.44s)]
*  You know, it was just it was too reserved and orchestrated [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8470.16s)]
*  and cultivated and curated. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8475.720000000001s)]
*  And it was homogenized, pasteurized, processed. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8477.880000000001s)]
*  Wasn't, you know, I mean, he would have to decide that he wanted to be the real person. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8483.880000000001s)]
*  It would have to be dirty and unproduced. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8489.640000000001s)]
*  It would have to be messy and real. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8492.800000000001s)]
*  You have to have some purpose. Yeah. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8495.480000000001s)]
*  There was no purpose to it. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8497.88s)]
*  I do it, honestly, to go commercial thing from Obama. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8499.0s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing that Obama is going to draw out of Bruce [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8502.96s)]
*  that would have any interest to me. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8505.48s)]
*  What could it could if you did it? [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8507.8s)]
*  They would both have to decide to do it that way. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8509.519999999999s)]
*  And there's nothing Bruce and Obama that we hadn't heard before. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8511.64s)]
*  So I started listening to it. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8514.92s)]
*  And then I says, I hear Obama say, well, you know, sometimes [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8516.4s)]
*  you just got to get out your guitar. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8520.519999999999s)]
*  That's what is Obama saying guitar for. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8522.679999999998s)]
*  I mean, in real life, you say guitar. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8526.24s)]
*  What are you putting on your? [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8531.0s)]
*  So it was so faked. Right. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8532.72s)]
*  From just that little signal. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8534.96s)]
*  Do you think that Obama, in a lot of ways, is also captured by fame? [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8536.4s)]
*  Oh, I mean, he's one of the most important presidents ever. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8540.0s)]
*  He's one of the best spokesmen, the best statesman the world has ever seen. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8543.72s)]
*  And, you know, so beloved and so captured by that. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8548.359999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's that's who he is. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8554.68s)]
*  Here's my analysis of Obama. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8556.28s)]
*  He the presidency that his presidency was historic, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8559.72s)]
*  transformational in so many ways, you know, and it was another part of the baby [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8564.44s)]
*  boom, you know, moving up, although he was in a boomer. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8570.48s)]
*  But that that sensibility equal right also to see a black man [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8574.16s)]
*  elected president was one of the best things we could say in our lifetime. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8578.960000000001s)]
*  This happened. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8582.72s)]
*  Just the sheer symbolism of who we were as a nation. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8584.279999999999s)]
*  Was he a consequential important president? [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8590.0s)]
*  Other than that, he was very competent, very good. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8592.88s)]
*  But I think that he made a big mistake [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8596.92s)]
*  is that he wouldn't play politics. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8600.48s)]
*  And I think if you're going to be the president, you got to play politics. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8602.88s)]
*  You know, he had he wouldn't [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8605.96s)]
*  engage with too much with his contributors, [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8609.92s)]
*  with the party people, the people who run the party locally and various places. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8612.92s)]
*  And he left behind a party that was in weak shape [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8617.640000000001s)]
*  for the next election, the Hillary election. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8620.36s)]
*  And a lot of. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8622.52s)]
*  Kind of pissed off people who felt they weren't treated right. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8625.640000000001s)]
*  Our our friends, the billionaires or less, he didn't want to deal with them. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8628.16s)]
*  You know, he didn't want to deal with this ugly business of for for it. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8632.240000000002s)]
*  But these are the people who give you the money for the campaign. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8635.12s)]
*  You got to have them. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8637.28s)]
*  So what did he do when you're saying I'm saying play politics? [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8638.400000000001s)]
*  He hears them. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8641.76s)]
*  He didn't cultivate the party mechanism. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8643.960000000001s)]
*  He didn't cultivate the donors. Right. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8645.6s)]
*  Here's what I thought was wrong. I thought at first he when he was elected, [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8648.24s)]
*  Pat, the center of the pro tem of the House of the Senate, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8652.720000000001s)]
*  Pat Leahy and also Nancy Pelosi and the congressman from Detroit, [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8658.800000000001s)]
*  whose name I forget from him, [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8663.08s)]
*  wanted to do have investigations [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8665.24s)]
*  conducted by the Senate of the Iraq War. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8668.48s)]
*  Why did we go in Iraq and have full Senate hearings [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8670.88s)]
*  and investigation undercover all that? [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8673.8s)]
*  He shut it down. They wanted to do it. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8676.8s)]
*  He said, no, I don't want to do it. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8679.24s)]
*  I want my administration to get out to a great start and peace and harmony. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8681.08s)]
*  And we're going to be bipartisan and all this stuff, which [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8685.4s)]
*  I was a horrible mistake because there was no such thing as that [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8688.32s)]
*  in this lifetime right now. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8691.8s)]
*  I think Obama thought somehow he would could magically change politics [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8693.48s)]
*  and this, you know, Kumbaya, not exactly Kumbaya, but [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8697.88s)]
*  achieve better presence because he himself thought I am such a [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8701.359999999999s)]
*  excellent conciliator that I have been a community organizer for most of my life. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8706.199999999999s)]
*  I know how to bring people together by sheer force, [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8711.199999999999s)]
*  my intellectual power and my gift of oratory and all that. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8713.64s)]
*  I will bring this together. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8717.039999999999s)]
*  That sounds like a great notion. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8718.16s)]
*  It's a great notion, but it's completely not in this world. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8719.96s)]
*  Let's look back at the history of the modern Republican Party. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8723.279999999999s)]
*  Look at the investigations that they have been conducting and of Clinton. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8726.88s)]
*  I mean, Clinton barely got into office and all of a sudden they started [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8731.359999999999s)]
*  right after Obama gets into office. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8734.96s)]
*  And the first thing that happens to him is the Senate Minority Leader, [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8737.64s)]
*  Senate Senator McConnell, says my main objective for the next four years [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8741.08s)]
*  is to make sure this is a one term president. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8744.8s)]
*  That's not a noble fucking goal. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8747.08s)]
*  But the hostility and the danger of the public service was so apparent. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8750.72s)]
*  I mean, look at how well the Republicans have used these [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8755.96s)]
*  investigations throughout years. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8758.36s)]
*  So here was the opportunity for Obama to say, go ahead and investigate the war. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8760.32s)]
*  First off, morally, it should have been done no matter what, because, I mean, [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8764.44s)]
*  this was a war under false pre-census, which was put together [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8768.36s)]
*  on base of bad evidence, either deliberate or undeliberate. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8771.6s)]
*  So somebody should be a held account. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8774.72s)]
*  And he could have knocked back on their feet [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8777.12s)]
*  all the current then leaders of the Republican Party who had brought us this war. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8782.44s)]
*  So you think he was trying to unite everybody and he was trying to be bipartisan. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8786.64s)]
*  And in doing that, he hampered himself. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8792.2s)]
*  Yes, yes. And I think it was also due to his own [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8795.64s)]
*  sense of self-worth, of his own overestimation [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8802.0s)]
*  of his skills in the climate of Washington. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8805.92s)]
*  Washington is not a kumbaya town. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8810.08s)]
*  It's a power game, top to bottom virtually. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8813.84s)]
*  And he had the opportunity there to wield it. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8817.24s)]
*  How could he know what it was like until he got in there, though? [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8820.359999999999s)]
*  I mean, how could he not have these? [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8823.48s)]
*  I mean, if he is that guy that we wanted in there in the first place, [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8826.039999999999s)]
*  he was this idealistic visionary. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8829.119999999999s)]
*  Of course, he would try to carry that on. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8832.32s)]
*  Well, I think you also have to be realistic, too, to get if you want to get things done. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8834.720000000001s)]
*  You're going to have to play politics. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8839.24s)]
*  Would you I mean, had people around him who are skilled professionals, [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8841.16s)]
*  including Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi with him and all these Chuck Schumer, [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8844.32s)]
*  a lot of people. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8848.92s)]
*  Did you get a chance to talk to him about that? [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8849.720000000001s)]
*  I've not. I had three long interviews with him over the course of his presidency. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8852.84s)]
*  And I never did bring that up with him. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8858.52s)]
*  And why not? I think that. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8863.12s)]
*  There's a my mind. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8866.36s)]
*  I don't like asking gotcha questions. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8868.76s)]
*  That's not even a gotcha. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8871.28s)]
*  I know. It's not. Well, it is a gotcha. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8872.36s)]
*  Is it? Well, it's not a gotcha question, but it is. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8873.800000000001s)]
*  Let me say I don't. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8876.84s)]
*  My thing with the interview is. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8879.36s)]
*  I want to draw something out of you. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8882.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I want I'm not. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8884.08s)]
*  You are not a politician. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8885.720000000001s)]
*  You're artist, you know, or you're you're trying, you know. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8887.68s)]
*  So let me say. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8889.96s)]
*  You don't want to piss the guy off [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8893.119999999999s)]
*  of the interview for one thing, right? [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8895.4s)]
*  Secondly, I hadn't really formulated that idea until [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8898.039999999999s)]
*  my second interview with him and. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8901.519999999999s)]
*  You know, he's going to he's going to be angry [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8906.0s)]
*  if you ask, say, were you chicken shit to to why did you do that? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8909.199999999999s)]
*  You know, I don't want to say it like that. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8912.8s)]
*  You would you would say it like what were your intentions [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8915.16s)]
*  and what did you what did you want to accomplish? [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8918.96s)]
*  And if you would go back and do it again, would you do it differently? [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8921.56s)]
*  And what do you think could have been done to, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8925.56s)]
*  you know, to bring people together to be bipartisan, but also [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8929.919999999998s)]
*  to expose some of these things that were critical issues? [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8934.199999999999s)]
*  Like why did we get involved in the Iraq War? [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8937.119999999999s)]
*  And that you formulate it exactly correctly. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8939.759999999998s)]
*  You know, what if, you know, that. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8942.48s)]

*  Are except when they're out of office and so on [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8949.759999999998s)]
*  of the presidents and the presidential candidates [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8953.119999999999s)]
*  I've interviewed, which have been Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8955.4s)]
*  and Obama. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8961.359999999999s)]
*  Are tough interviews. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8964.8s)]
*  They are not there to reveal themselves like Michael Jackson, like [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8966.8s)]
*  but with super high stakes. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8971.839999999998s)]
*  If a candidate makes a spontaneous comment, say, should I should? [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8974.039999999999s)]
*  Right. You know, investigate it because, you know, you know, Bush was really [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8977.6s)]
*  he's a war criminal. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8981.16s)]
*  He should have or change. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8982.0s)]
*  Right. One false remark. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8984.0s)]
*  And you've got you've blown up the world all of a sudden. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8986.12s)]
*  And newspapers all in the media. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8989.0s)]
*  And it's a week of your time wasted because you said some harmless kind of thing. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8990.6s)]
*  So they're they're not, especially in the campaign, [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8994.92s)]
*  going to say anything that they haven't really thought through. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=8998.28s)]
*  I was going to be pretested or vetted somehow. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9001.24s)]
*  They're not going to piss off this industry or that industry. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9005.28s)]
*  You know, if they when they talk about energy uses, they're not going to piss off [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9008.2s)]
*  the agriculture interests by saying this thing about the minute they say, [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9011.240000000002s)]
*  oh, is it a transitional fuel? [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9014.640000000001s)]
*  Then, you know, those states are up. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9016.480000000001s)]
*  And I mean, you can't you know, you can't really speak the truth anymore. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9018.28s)]
*  So I was you can't you know. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9021.400000000001s)]
*  So you don't want to ask them questions which they can't answer truthfully. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9024.92s)]
*  You know, and. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9030.160000000002s)]
*  You give them the opportunity to answer questions they can answer honestly. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9033.0s)]
*  So I asked generally about how do you feel about things? [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9037.12s)]
*  You know, what was your purpose? [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9040.76s)]
*  And not only to skip the gotcha questions or the questions that everybody [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9042.56s)]
*  asks every day, the president, when will this be passed? [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9046.64s)]
*  Or do you think there'll be peace or whatever? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9049.32s)]
*  The kind of daily I go into trying to figure out who the person is [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9051.52s)]
*  and kind of take a measure of their thinking and their sensitivity [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9056.52s)]
*  and how they're feeling about things, because everything else [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9060.2s)]
*  a president says is vetted or formalized or you can't be truthful. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9063.640000000001s)]
*  But every now and you get them, I mean, there was. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9068.240000000002s)]
*  I love talking to Clinton because he's always talked like some kind of [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9072.36s)]
*  cornpwn from the South, you know, he's talking about the NATO allies [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9075.400000000001s)]
*  and something because they were madder than three chickens in a henhouse [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9078.6s)]
*  to an you know, and he talks southern about they know. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9081.76s)]
*  I mean, what do you do? [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9084.960000000001s)]
*  You know, and Obama, the most honest, [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9085.960000000001s)]
*  I was scheduled to interview Obama for the exit interview [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9089.960000000001s)]
*  and was scheduled to take place the day after the election. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9093.76s)]
*  And that night, Trump won. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9096.720000000001s)]
*  So when I got up in the morning, very drunk still, being hung over [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9099.28s)]
*  like about everybody. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9103.44s)]
*  I mean, anyway, not I called the White House and said, look, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9104.92s)]
*  I had to leave at eight o'clock. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9108.560000000001s)]
*  What if you want, I'll postpone this interview till, you know, next week. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9110.12s)]
*  So you have a chance to do this. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9113.76s)]
*  He's no, no. You know, Obama wants to. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9115.44s)]
*  We'll call you back. Obama wants to do it. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9117.160000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry. And [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9119.12s)]
*  come on down as scheduled. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9122.84s)]
*  So I had prepared, you know, for three days for the interview. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9125.6s)]
*  All kinds of questions, you know, like what what do you think the world should be? [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9129.68s)]
*  And what advice would you give Hillary, your successor? [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9133.84s)]
*  What are the big problems? [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9137.0s)]
*  He had the old the valedictory lap. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9138.400000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9141.28s)]
*  The. So I had to scramble to create a whole new interview. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9141.560000000001s)]
*  But we got to the White House. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9146.480000000001s)]
*  I went down with my son, Gus. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9147.72s)]
*  It's deserted. The whole town is gray and cloudy anyway. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9150.76s)]
*  Get the way it's virtually deserted. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9153.519999999999s)]
*  There's nobody there's the Marine Guard at the reception desk and a secretary. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9155.199999999999s)]
*  And that's it. It's completely dead. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9159.519999999999s)]
*  And then Obama walks out, gets us coat and tie chip. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9162.279999999999s)]
*  You know, like energetic says, OK, yeah, let's get this done. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9165.88s)]
*  Let's go. Come on. Go in the Oval Office. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9169.24s)]
*  So I'm trying to. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9171.76s)]
*  The main question now on the table is what the fuck happened? [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9174.080000000002s)]
*  Right. You know, how did she lose? [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9178.0s)]
*  What's the future of the country right now? [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9180.160000000002s)]
*  You know, you want to ask, because now everything was up, [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9181.960000000001s)]
*  you know, completely up and up in the air and dance around. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9184.68s)]
*  That's when I said, well, I said, what do you what? [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9189.2s)]
*  What? He says, well, I said, what makes you what do you hope? [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9192.28s)]
*  I said, well, why are you hopeful? [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9195.800000000001s)]
*  He said, well, because when you get to the Oval Office, you change [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9198.0s)]
*  and you sit here and you look up that picture of George Washington over that. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9200.960000000001s)]
*  Portrait somehow changes you. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9203.960000000001s)]
*  I said, well, Mr. President, how [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9205.32s)]
*  he is 75 years old or 74 years old. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9209.04s)]
*  What what do you possibly think is going to change about him? [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9212.92s)]
*  And make him into a person. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9218.0s)]
*  He looks at his well. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9220.56s)]
*  Look, John, if you if you want me to get on my knees, [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9222.84s)]
*  get down on the floor and curl up in a ball and start crying about this, [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9226.84s)]
*  I'll do that for you. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9231.16s)]
*  You know, do you want me to do that? [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9232.52s)]

*  My mother died of cancer two weeks ago. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9238.28s)]
*  It's a tragedy. This is an election. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9239.92s)]
*  And when after that, if you don't like you, get up and you work. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9242.0s)]
*  You know, you don't come. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9245.560000000001s)]
*  Great thing to say. I mean, and absolutely right. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9247.4s)]
*  And also, I mean, so states like us, [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9250.28s)]

*  He's got to now reassure the country that things are going to be OK. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9260.039999999999s)]
*  Don't push the panic button yet. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9263.84s)]
*  Reassure our allies in particular overseas that this is not going to go out the rails. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9266.24s)]
*  He had he there was nothing he could say. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9271.44s)]
*  So, I mean, I could have. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9274.84s)]
*  Again, he's done it, but gone further with the thing, [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9278.0s)]
*  but he said this, how can you say that? [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9281.96s)]
*  And, you know, discuss the dangers he represented or the things that might happen [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9283.88s)]
*  or the fears that people had, but it wouldn't have gone anywhere [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9288.8s)]
*  because he wouldn't be able to speak to it. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9291.439999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, I remember early on asking Al Gore [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9293.359999999999s)]
*  when he was running for president, what are we going to do about drug legalization? [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9296.88s)]

*  Why? He's in a position, if he says the wrong thing about this, [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9318.720000000001s)]
*  that he that he may not get elected, he may be thrown out, [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9323.640000000001s)]
*  wanting to ruin the primary. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9327.800000000001s)]
*  They'll get him so hard. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9329.32s)]
*  I think what is the point of doing that? [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9330.44s)]
*  I mean, I know Al I knew well, Al. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9332.08s)]
*  Well, actually, I know what he's going to do when he gets in there. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9335.04s)]
*  He's going to start moving towards legalization, decriminalization as fast as he can [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9338.800000000001s)]
*  and constrained only by, you know, public opinion, other things lifted. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9343.36s)]
*  So I don't push it further. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9350.0s)]
*  You know, I said, well, how's after he [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9352.04s)]
*  lost the election, he we had lunch one day at my office [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9357.24s)]
*  about a year after he hadn't decided [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9362.24s)]
*  whether to run again or not, and he was he asked me what I thought. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9364.84s)]
*  I was very flattered that he was curious about my opinion. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9370.0s)]
*  And I said, what do you think he said? [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9373.12s)]
*  Well, you know, I just I don't have the appetite to lie anymore. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9374.72s)]
*  You know, I'm tired of this. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9379.56s)]
*  You know, I want to be able to speak what's on my mind. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9381.68s)]
*  And that, wow, that's the truth. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9384.36s)]
*  Yeah, and truth. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9386.48s)]
*  That's a man who is weary. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9387.84s)]
*  I mean, that of how do you live with that? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9389.92s)]
*  You know, and he's a brilliant man and he can't tell the truth. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9393.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9397.48s)]
*  Michael, well, that's the beauty of having a conversation [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9398.84s)]
*  with a person like that. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9402.36s)]
*  And I think your approach is very similar to my approach. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9403.480000000001s)]
*  You're just trying to get the person to express themselves. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9406.640000000001s)]
*  And it's very difficult for someone to express themselves when they're. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9409.400000000001s)]
*  In a job that literally prohibits them from expressing themselves [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9413.84s)]
*  and could inhibit progress, could change the way they view the world [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9418.6s)]
*  and the world views them. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9423.84s)]
*  Very, very complicated. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9425.2s)]
*  I would imagine that's the those are the worst people to try to get something out of. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9426.28s)]
*  Can I mean, all these as you say, all these people that I've dealt with [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9431.28s)]
*  are really under public pressure. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9435.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9437.64s)]
*  To or under private pressure like Bob Dylan. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9438.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9441.12s)]
*  To keep their keep privacy. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9441.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9443.76s)]
*  Keep people reveal a little of yourself, but don't reveal as artists. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9444.28s)]
*  If you reveal too much and. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9448.28s)]
*  Destroy that sense of mystery. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9450.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9452.28s)]
*  Destroy that sense of mystery. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9453.8s)]
*  Then you've lost a little there. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9455.16s)]
*  The thing is about a president, you don't think of him as an artist. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9456.48s)]
*  So you don't think of that as an option. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9459.24s)]
*  But you don't you want them to express themselves. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9462.759999999998s)]
*  But they don't want to do that because they have a narrative [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9466.84s)]
*  and they have a they have a thing that they're trying to push. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9470.84s)]
*  It's a very fucked up way to not just to govern, but to be governed, [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9474.56s)]
*  but to just like to we understand that they're full of shit. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9480.199999999999s)]
*  We understand that they're putting on a persona and an act and we accept it. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9483.519999999999s)]
*  And there's no other options. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9487.4s)]
*  I mean, in a lot of ways, that's what people liked about Trump [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9489.64s)]
*  was that he was this guy that wasn't going to do that. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9493.24s)]
*  And he was going to talk in a way that seemed at least he was revealing [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9496.439999999999s)]
*  a few more layers of the onion than anybody else was. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9500.72s)]
*  It's true. He had, you know, he had the look of being spontaneous. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9504.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9508.24s)]
*  Ironically, that he was being honest, although he wasn't a politician. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9508.8s)]
*  It was. So he came on as if I'm going to tell you the truth. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9511.64s)]
*  He was the most dishonest president we've ever had. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9515.16s)]
*  And he but he looked like he was no bullshit. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9517.84s)]
*  And I think that that resonates with people, especially people that aren't [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9523.32s)]
*  doing a deep dive into what is actually going on. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9528.359999999999s)]
*  I wish we'd have people who would be almost in office [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9531.599999999999s)]
*  to be more open about debating the stakes and tell the truth [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9535.08s)]
*  about what they think is going on and let let that out. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9538.24s)]
*  But it's not in the nature of of our society. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9542.36s)]
*  It's not in a. I mean, we we we we punish people who show vulnerability. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9545.88s)]
*  Well, that's what people liked about McGovern, right? [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9552.08s)]
*  I think he was. Yeah, he was not. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9554.88s)]
*  He was a sincere, deep man. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9557.84s)]
*  He came from a religious background, a small state. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9560.76s)]
*  He seems known here when he was talking. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9563.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And I believe he was. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9566.359999999999s)]
*  He was he loved him. He loved Hunter. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9568.56s)]
*  Hunter loved him. And I I I plagiarized a few things from in my book, from [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9570.92s)]
*  an article McGovern wrote in Rolling Stone because it was so well expressed. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9577.88s)]
*  And and he was able to tell the truth about the Vietnam War because [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9582.679999999998s)]
*  he was not politically challenged in his state. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9587.88s)]
*  He felt passionately about the morality of it. Yeah. He. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9592.0s)]
*  He embodied, you know, the hopes and dreams of a generation there. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9596.839999999998s)]
*  Is it possible to have someone like that today? [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9601.48s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, the media is so nutty. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9605.08s)]
*  It's always been that you get punished so hard by the opposition [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9609.199999999999s)]
*  power, part of opposition party, the mainstream press and the Internet press, [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9613.64s)]
*  Internet people for speaking out on on anything, you know, [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9619.8s)]
*  get mocked one way. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9624.64s)]
*  So there's a real premium to say nothing. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9625.96s)]
*  You know, be as obscure as possible. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9629.28s)]
*  And it comes from the mainstream press just as much as it comes from Internet. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9631.32s)]
*  I mean, not that's true. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9635.4s)]
*  It comes the Internet is the craziest thing ever. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9636.72s)]
*  Social media. Yeah. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9639.64s)]
*  And because it's totally unregulated. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9641.039999999999s)]
*  Well, it's not just unregulated. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9643.6s)]
*  It's also orchestrated by foreign entities and by even national entities. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9644.92s)]
*  National entities more than foreign. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9650.6s)]
*  Yeah. There's a lot of that going on. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9652.16s)]
*  I mean, people want to talk about like Russian troll farms. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9654.08s)]
*  If you don't think that that shit is going on through American, [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9656.800000000001s)]
*  that's there's without doubt there's interest in this country [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9659.960000000001s)]
*  that are orchestrating narratives. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9663.48s)]
*  Totally. I mean, that's all this Proud Boys coming on. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9666.04s)]
*  All kinds of shit. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9669.12s)]
*  All kinds of mean one of the things they found out. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9670.36s)]
*  I mean, there's just so much of what we discuss that's orchestrated. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9672.960000000001s)]
*  You know, they found out that 19 of the top 20 Christian sites on Facebook [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9677.640000000001s)]
*  were troll farms. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9681.96s)]
*  These wild. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9682.96s)]
*  So they're they're organizing dissent and organizing conflict [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9684.759999999998s)]
*  and getting people riled up and arguments. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9689.439999999999s)]
*  And they're doing it purposely. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9691.56s)]
*  Well, this was the this is a difference, I think, between Internet now [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9693.24s)]
*  what we've had is a robust, robust press in the past, [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9697.56s)]
*  which have riled up wars, you know, because nobody they're not innocent either. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9701.919999999998s)]
*  But the Internet is totally unregulated. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9705.599999999999s)]
*  Right. And yet it is a public utility, [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9709.2s)]
*  just like television and radio waves and stations that has been financed [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9712.0s)]
*  in particularly by the government. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9717.0s)]
*  The government paid for the Internet. Right. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9718.92s)]
*  They developed it in the Defense Department. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9721.6s)]
*  It was put out there with government. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9723.640000000001s)]
*  It's owned by the public. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9726.080000000002s)]
*  It should be regulated as a public utility [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9728.240000000002s)]
*  and by the same rules that govern radio and television. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9730.800000000001s)]
*  You know, the Internet should not be this free do anything place. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9734.6s)]
*  There are rules and regulations, laws about fairness, about libel, [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9737.68s)]
*  about reckless disregard for the truth, about publishing something [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9742.6s)]
*  with miscellaneous malicious intent, about deliberate lying. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9746.12s)]
*  And if it were just governed by the basic rules [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9750.880000000001s)]
*  by which we regulate the rest of the press, free speech, [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9754.56s)]

*  which means that you can't yell fire in a theater. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9760.4s)]
*  Right. And you can't publish stuff knowingly false. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9763.0s)]
*  And you can't publish stuff you're doing out of malice. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9766.36s)]
*  But don't you think there's also some real benefit to it [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9770.36s)]
*  in that it allows real investigative reporting that's not popular, [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9773.64s)]
*  that's not popular with corporate entities, [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9778.44s)]

*  it's not popular with the military industrial complex or politicians. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9782.92s)]
*  And you get opinions that resonate with people [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9786.72s)]
*  that would not be expressed in any other way. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9789.64s)]
*  I think that's totally important and totally worth doing. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9791.96s)]

*  And we're looking at malicious intent and orchestrated and orchestrated. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9800.8s)]
*  Yeah. On top of that. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9805.48s)]
*  Yeah. So that's what evil. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9806.72s)]
*  And on the other hand, it's brilliant at democratization of communication [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9808.199999999999s)]
*  and expressing opinions and making the cost of investigative journalism lower [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9813.0s)]
*  because you have to have something with all these high overhead. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9817.64s)]

*  If you don't regulate it. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9832.16s)]

*  Do you trust the government to regulate the Internet? [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9835.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9837.44s)]
*  You trust the people that got us into the Iraq War under false pretenses [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9838.2s)]
*  to regulate the Internet? [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9842.24s)]
*  Do you think that makes any sense? [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9844.4s)]
*  Well, wait a minute. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9845.800000000001s)]
*  I would not. The people who got us into the Iraq War. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9846.880000000001s)]
*  It's the government. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9849.48s)]
*  Where's the politicians? [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9850.24s)]
*  It's the government. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9852.48s)]
*  In the end, yes, it's the government. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9854.24s)]
*  But who else is going to regulate it? [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9855.92s)]
*  But if they're going to be in power and they're regulating the Internet, [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9857.4s)]
*  they're going to regulate the Internet in a way that suits their best interests. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9859.96s)]
*  The same way they do with the banking industry, [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9862.64s)]

*  What what represents their interests? [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9870.8s)]
*  There's so much you're talking about, so much money involved [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9873.199999999999s)]
*  in disseminating information in a very particular way. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9877.08s)]
*  Right now, the Internet companies are rich beyond belief. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9880.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's fat, but it's it's a disruptive thing that has never existed before. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9883.08s)]
*  My I think it exists. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9887.76s)]
*  And I think where we're at is where we're at. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9890.68s)]
*  I think we need to move forward collectively as a country [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9893.24s)]
*  with an ethic that respects truth [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9897.36s)]
*  and that appreciates opinions and reality and an understanding of things [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9901.44s)]
*  that's not necessarily possible with corporate interest involved [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9907.52s)]
*  in dissemination of information. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9911.6s)]
*  But there's no way to do that, except through the government. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9913.279999999999s)]
*  There's no excuse. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9916.32s)]
*  There's no way you can do that, except through the government. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9917.68s)]
*  Why is that human nature is not going to change, [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9919.84s)]
*  but the government's not going to change either. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9921.72s)]
*  But the government is capable of change. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9923.24s)]
*  OK, look, the government regulates, for example, the food supply [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9925.32s)]
*  or can regulate. Let's take the food supply. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9929.72s)]
*  Yeah. The Department of Agriculture. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9932.4s)]
*  Why have they let glyphosate infestate all of our foods? [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9934.24s)]
*  Let's say it was one thing. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9937.92s)]
*  Yeah, but that's a problem. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9939.32s)]
*  That's a great regulating. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9940.4s)]
*  Well, then we better get better politicians in them to support better people. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9941.92s)]
*  I mean, it's not again. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9945.84s)]
*  Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Right. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9948.039999999999s)]
*  OK, so let's take the. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9950.68s)]
*  SEC or take the Food and Drug Administration's regulates big pharma. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9954.6s)]
*  On the one hand, we've got a very safe [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9958.6s)]
*  supply of drugs in this country, you know. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9961.8s)]
*  Safe. Their drugs are tested. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9963.68s)]
*  You know, you don't get too many bad drugs, you know, [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9967.36s)]
*  prescribed drugs. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9971.32s)]
*  Twenty five percent of all drugs approved by the FDA get recalled. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9972.04s)]
*  That's better than if we didn't regulate it. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9976.92s)]
*  You got 100 percent. You have packed medicine. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9978.84s)]
*  But it's also like, why is it even that much? [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9981.36s)]
*  Well, I agree with you. We stop that. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9984.08s)]
*  So you just be a letter. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9985.960000000001s)]
*  We need government better government. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9987.800000000001s)]
*  We need to promise money. Right. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9989.56s)]
*  The reason why these drugs get approved in the first place is [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9991.16s)]
*  because these people know they can profit off these drugs and not just bad drugs. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9994.24s)]
*  They recall, but fake drugs that are one molecule different [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=9999.119999999999s)]
*  than the original drugs, so they can copyright a new drug. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10004.039999999999s)]
*  The past keep the patent going, selling cheap alternatives. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10007.28s)]
*  Why are we charging so much for insulin in this country? [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10010.24s)]
*  I mean, it's life dependency. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10013.32s)]
*  Your life depends on your supply of innocence. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10015.28s)]
*  And this is called life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10017.56s)]
*  Where's that guarantee of life? [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10020.44s)]
*  When you look at the Internet, which is this incredibly disruptive technology, [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10021.88s)]
*  and you see the expansion of technology in general, [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10025.64s)]
*  that technological innovation just seems to be a part of our culture and inexorably. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10029.4s)]

*  Like, what do you what are your thoughts on like the metaverse [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10036.119999999999s)]

*  Well, the metaverse itself, I just think that is a marketing slogan. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10045.64s)]
*  The mark of Zuckerberg's, I don't think. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10049.2s)]

*  It's forget the metaverse. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10052.44s)]
*  Well, I'm talking about the full integration of human beings and technology, [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10054.2s)]
*  which seems to be happening, whether we like it or not. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10058.92s)]
*  I can't. What I think is that. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10061.92s)]
*  What scares me is kind of future, this kind of predicted in Star Wars, you know, [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10066.84s)]
*  or I recently read 1984, which is we were at 1984 now. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10072.6s)]
*  I mean, if you think about the Internet and you think you have in your pocket [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10077.32s)]
*  a device every day, the phone which tracks you, [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10081.76s)]
*  which can be now turned on to listen to you without your knowledgeing, [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10085.88s)]
*  which knows everything, shop your health history, everything about you, [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10089.76s)]
*  who you hang out with, everything as possible you do. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10093.4s)]

*  And eventually it's going to be in your body. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10101.4s)]
*  Well, and eventually be in your body. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10103.56s)]

*  So we're there. I think it's good and bad. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10112.279999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think it makes life a lot more convenient. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10114.92s)]
*  But I think we better get the Internet under control because [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10117.16s)]
*  we're going to get to that point. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10121.64s)]
*  I mean, it's just a part of life now. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10123.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is demonstrated can be really enable our lives to be better. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10125.6s)]
*  I mean, that's the reason I phone is with every character. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10129.92s)]
*  It's not by law, it's convenient because it's better. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10133.16s)]
*  It's got maps in it. It's got the Internet. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10135.919999999998s)]

*  It's the cheapest thing you get to. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10141.0s)]
*  I mean, really, for whatever you're paying for it, you're getting the world. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10142.759999999998s)]
*  You're getting interconnectivity to to Bali. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10146.64s)]
*  Just very, very, very complicated. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10150.0s)]
*  And it's very seductive. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10152.8s)]
*  You know, like a TV screen is designed to be. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pz6lewGvY&t=10154.72s)]
