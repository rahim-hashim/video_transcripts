# Joe Rogan Experience #1986 - Jack Carr
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5.82s)]
*  All right, we're up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9.72s)]
*  And we are up. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=12.72s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=15.72s)]
*  Good to see you, man. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=16.72s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=17.72s)]
*  How does it feel to have another one done? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=18.72s)]
*  Oh, it feels great, but there's another one in the works, so it doesn't really stop. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=22.12s)]
*  I mean, I hear some guys like John Grisham talk about they do six months of work and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=26.84s)]
*  six months off, and that's kind of the routine that they've gotten on. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=30.32s)]
*  But for me, it's go, go, go, this, the next one, scripts, although... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=34.2s)]
*  Do you ever anticipate doing like a six-month-on, six-month-off thing? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=37.44s)]
*  Maybe when the kids are out of the house, maybe someday, way later on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=41.4s)]
*  But right now, it's still building. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=44.8s)]
*  It's just like any entrepreneurial type of venture. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=45.8s)]
*  You got to just go and keep building and take advantage of momentum and look for gaps in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=47.72s)]
*  the enemy's defenses and adapt and just go, go, go, go. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  So it's a constant thing from the second I wake up till everybody else is in bed and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=55.0s)]
*  I'm working for a few more hours. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=59.16s)]
*  Yeah, you got to make hay while the sun's shining. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=60.4s)]
*  I think about that too with the podcast. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm like, one day we'll do... [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=65.24s)]
*  I do so many things. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=66.64s)]
*  Sometimes I'm like, one day maybe I'll just do one thing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=68.36s)]
*  I don't know, you'd be able to do that? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=71.52s)]
*  I don't think I'm ill. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=72.52s)]
*  Have you ever been bored? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=73.52s)]
*  I don't even know what that means. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=74.52s)]
*  Neither do I. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=76.52s)]
*  When people talk about being bored, like I'm going to hear that from one of our kids, I'm [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=77.52s)]
*  like, that's like the one thing that gets me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=79.8s)]
*  But it's because I've never been bored in my life. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=83.16s)]
*  I'm bored at things. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=84.84s)]
*  If someone takes me to a gala and I have to dress like a monkey, sit there and wait. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  How many of those have you... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=93.08s)]
*  You don't do those anymore, do you? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=94.08s)]
*  I had to do one recently. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=95.08s)]
*  Oh, for what? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=96.08s)]
*  Yeah, a friend. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=97.08s)]
*  There was an art thing that was going on here so I had to dress up and I'm like, Jesus Christ. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=98.08s)]
*  Every now and again it's okay, maybe. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=103.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=104.68s)]
*  It was okay because I was next to my friend and his wife and my wife and it was fun. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=105.68s)]
*  But it's for the most part. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=110.04s)]
*  That's the only time I get bored. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=111.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=112.68s)]
*  Then I get hostile. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=113.92s)]
*  Then I have a couple of drinks and I get a little hostile. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=114.92s)]
*  Are people nervous when you're there? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  They get weird. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  They get weird, man. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Just looking at you as you're there? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=122.48s)]
*  Yeah, people stare at me. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=123.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's gotten exponentially weirder over the last three years. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  I bet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=128.84s)]
*  I used to be able to blend in. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=129.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=130.84s)]
*  Five years ago I could blend in anywhere. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=131.84s)]
*  Yeah, just people say hi but that would be it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=132.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=135.16s)]
*  But now it changes the dynamic of the room type of thing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=136.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=138.68s)]
*  I'm not changing the dynamic of any room, I don't think, but people definitely in the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=139.68s)]
*  airport stop and say hi and I feel so just fortunate that people are interested enough [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=143.2s)]
*  in the books or the podcast or the TV show or whatever to actually recognize me and say [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=147.2s)]
*  hi. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=150.92s)]
*  One guy recognized me by my Sitka backpack last night. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=151.92s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  I was flying out here and he's like, the backpack gave you away because I was in the corner [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  calling my wife on Mother's Day and my mom on Mother's Day. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Both and a guy walked by. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=159.67999999999998s)]
*  It's called Optifade. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  He said, well, no, it's the gray one, it's the Drifter. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  It just blends but it has a little Sitka symbol. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  He said, the backpack gave you away. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=167.04s)]
*  I turned around and so said hi. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=168.6s)]
*  But I feel extremely fortunate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=170.48s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=172.76s)]
*  We're very lucky guys to be able to do what we love to do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=173.76s)]
*  When someone meets you too, also it's like your writing is so brutal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  In particular. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=182.6s)]
*  You're such a nice guy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=183.6s)]
*  It's like when someone meets you they're like, what the fuck is going on behind those eyes? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=187.04s)]
*  I worry about that with, they won't spend too much time worrying about it, but like [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=192.0s)]
*  our kids' parents, his friends' parents, that sort of thing. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=196.12s)]
*  Did you read his book? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=199.4s)]
*  It was a little disturbing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=200.4s)]
*  Maybe our kids shouldn't play over there type of a thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=201.6s)]
*  So, well, I don't know, but that's kind of what I think about. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=203.8s)]
*  Like if I were someone else's parent, it was to read this and not know me, never having [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=206.6s)]
*  met me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=209.76s)]
*  And all of a sudden you read this thing like, maybe our son or daughter should find another [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=210.76s)]
*  friend. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  I would worry about that more in California. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, in California. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  So what are we drinking here? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  What is this? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=219.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=220.8s)]
*  So right here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=221.8s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=222.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for everything. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=223.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=224.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=225.8s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=226.8s)]
*  The official Jack Carr leather colored whiskey glasses. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=227.8s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=228.8s)]
*  The whiskey glasses. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=229.8s)]
*  They're all made out of their whiskey. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  And who made this whiskey? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  That's not bad. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  So it's very good. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  So this is Hooten Young right there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  So veterans. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  Jack Carr edition. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Jack Carr edition right here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  And so there's both veterans, but Norm Hooten was played by Eric Bana in Black Hawk Down. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  So he was a Delta operator who's now out, makes these, makes cigars that I'll show you [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  here in a second. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=252.24s)]
*  Oh, makes cigars too. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=253.24s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=254.24s)]
*  Cigars and this, this whiskey, and I put them in the show in the terminal list. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=255.24s)]
*  So when Chris Pratt's there drinking with Boozer in that first episode, put a little [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=256.88s)]
*  Hooten Young on there and there's no product placement in like in the show, in the books. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=260.92s)]
*  People think that that's a huge thing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=264.8s)]
*  And in a lot of Hollywood, I think it is if someone's like, let me open this tab, you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=265.8s)]
*  know, back in 1985 or whatever. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=269.76s)]
*  But there's none of that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=271.92s)]
*  It's all just character development tools. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=272.92s)]
*  And so I want to try to hook up some, whoever I can. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=274.12s)]
*  And these guys put in so much time in service to this nation. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=276.4s)]
*  So it's right on that, right on the counter there in that first episode. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=279.84s)]
*  But that's the best kind of product placement. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  And it helps develop the, yeah, exactly. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  There's no, no one pays to get in any of these, which is quite, I didn't know how it was going [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  to work with Hollywood. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=290.68s)]
*  It was my first time down that road. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=291.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=292.68s)]
*  I didn't think they were going to say, hey, you know what? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=293.68s)]
*  You have this and I know it's important and I know who the guys are, but how about this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=295.08s)]
*  company they're paying us? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=298.76s)]
*  So let's put that in there instead. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=299.96s)]
*  And it wasn't like that at all, which was pretty cool. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=300.96s)]
*  And I think it's all because Chris Antoine Fuqua and the showrunner just held the line [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=303.08s)]
*  and said, hey, no, we're just going to use these things to make it organic and authentic [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=306.52s)]
*  and root this whole thing in this foundation of operator culture. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=310.28s)]
*  It also probably helps that you guys are on Amazon too, which is like a fairly new platform. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=318.64s)]
*  And in terms of like streaming and things, it's only like the last decade or so. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=319.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=323.28s)]
*  Netflix had a little head start. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=324.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=325.28s)]
*  As opposed to something like NBC or CBS or ABC, which is like probably standard operational [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=326.28s)]
*  procedure to like have people pay to put Coca-Cola on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=331.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=335.36s)]
*  Because they're going to need to make money however they can because now they're in competition [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=336.36s)]
*  with Amazon and with Netflix. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=338.64s)]
*  They're going to come to you with Bud Light. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=339.64s)]
*  You guys can fix Bud Light. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=341.68s)]
*  I saw a new one today. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=342.68s)]
*  Did you see the Miller Lite one today? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=343.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=345.8s)]
*  Like, does no one learn? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=346.8s)]
*  Does no one learn? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=347.8s)]
*  I mean, and they were taking all those ads that we love from the 80s and they were just [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  putting them in shredders. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=352.48s)]
*  That was their campaign today. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=353.48s)]
*  I saw it this morning. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=355.2s)]
*  This is so stupid. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=356.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=357.2s)]
*  But once again. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=358.2s)]
*  Like there's something wrong. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=359.2s)]
*  Also, it's making there's something wrong with women wearing bikinis. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=360.2s)]
*  Those women wear bikinis because they look great. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  They like to look great. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=365.68s)]
*  They take photos of them looking great. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  The girls see those photos of them in bikinis. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=368.72s)]
*  They get excited. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=370.68s)]
*  Look I look great. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  People buy it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=373.2s)]
*  Wow, she looks great. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=374.2s)]
*  It's not bad to look great. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=375.2s)]
*  It's just like it's not bad for a guy to have a shirt off. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=376.88000000000005s)]
*  If Chris Pratt has a shirt off and he's looking ripped, it's not objectifying. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=379.16s)]
*  I mean, I guess it is, but it's not negative. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=382.8s)]
*  It's not negative. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  It's selling movie tickets right there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  That ad is so weird. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=388.68s)]
*  Isn't it strange? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=389.68s)]
*  You want to watch it? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=390.68s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=391.68s)]
*  Let's watch it just so we can goof out. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=392.68s)]
*  Oh boy, here we go. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=393.68s)]
*  I couldn't believe it this morning. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=394.68s)]
*  They don't learn. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=396.24s)]
*  No one learns. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=397.24s)]
*  Well, it's just in general, I think. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=398.24s)]
*  It's kind of those taking lessons from the past and applying them going forward as wisdom. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=399.68s)]
*  How about lessons from a week ago? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=404.24s)]
*  It's not even the past. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=405.24s)]
*  A couple days ago. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=406.76s)]
*  The only thing that saves is maybe they spent a lot of money on it and they filmed it six [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=407.76s)]
*  months ago. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  Still. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  I've already seen it. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  There's an article from two months ago. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  But still, you could put a pause on that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  It came out two months ago? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  At least two months ago. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=420.44s)]
*  Okay, so it came out before the bullshit, right? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=421.6s)]
*  Was that about the same time as the bullshit with Miller? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=424.12s)]
*  This says it was in honor of Women's History Month. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=427.48s)]
*  This is where they put it out. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=429.6s)]
*  So I saw it today and I was like, maybe there's a reason they made this and we just started [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=430.6s)]
*  seeing that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=434.12s)]
*  But it's also crazy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=435.12s)]
*  They want to shred all the good looking pictures from the 80s. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=437.0s)]
*  And they're buying it back. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=438.92s)]
*  That was part of the thing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=439.92s)]
*  They're buying back all those old ads that people have, I guess, in their garage wall. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=440.92s)]
*  That's what it said in this thing that I saw this morning. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=445.24s)]
*  And they're going to turn it into good. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=448.24s)]
*  Mulch? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=450.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=451.24s)]
*  They're saying women brewed beer. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=452.24s)]
*  They said they were the first. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=457.24s)]
*  Women were the ones doing the brewing. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=458.24s)]
*  Centuries later, how did the industry pay homage to the founding mothers of beer? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=460.64s)]
*  They put us in bikinis. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=465.24s)]
*  With awesome pictures like that is how. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  This looks hot. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=470.84000000000003s)]
*  Those are great ads. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  Those are great ads. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  It's time beer made it up to women. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  So today, Miller Lite is on a mission to clean up their shit. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  No beer industry. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  Miller Lite is on a mission to make sure no one buys their stuff. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  They're scouring the internet and buying it back. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  They're scouring the internet and buying it back. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=488.84000000000003s)]
*  Because that's easy to do once you get an image up there on the internet. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=492.0s)]
*  So what is she saying? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=495.0s)]
*  If you compost to worms, push it out beautiful fertilizer. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=496.0s)]
*  That good shit helps farmers grow quality hops. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=501.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=504.0s)]
*  Which has been donated to women brewers to make their own really good shit. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=505.0s)]
*  But there's definitely more shit out there. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=509.0s)]
*  In your attic, in the garage, in your parents' basement. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=511.0s)]
*  Send any shit you got into Miller Lite and they'll turn that into good shit too. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=514.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=518.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=519.0s)]
*  So here's to women. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=520.16s)]
*  Because without us, there would be no beer. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=521.16s)]
*  Oh god. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=526.16s)]
*  I hate identity politics with a passion. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=527.16s)]
*  I really do. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=530.16s)]
*  It's pretty interesting. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=531.16s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=532.16s)]
*  It's that human beings made beer, okay? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=533.16s)]
*  And some human beings look good in bikinis. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=536.16s)]
*  It's like, what are we doing? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=538.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=540.16s)]
*  Women do it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=541.16s)]
*  Women do it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=542.16s)]
*  Women do it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=543.16s)]
*  I'd like to see a pie chart of how many women are actually involved in making beer or drinking beer. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=544.16s)]
*  Well now I'm going to hold on to all those posters for Miller Lite that I have from the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=548.3199999999999s)]
*  80s in my garage. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm going to turn that stuff in. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  It's going to be worth a lot more now. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you have some? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=555.3199999999999s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  I wish I did. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=557.3199999999999s)]
*  All those years. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  Miller Lite ads with their shit. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  No, I mean, that was crazy to wake up. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, to see that this morning. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  Can you, does paper turn into compost? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  Is that how it works? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, isn't it a bunch of chemicals and shit? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  Are they lying to us? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  Why would something like that just get resurfaced on like a Monday and not everyone's talking [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  about it? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  Because people are angry. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  They're looking to be angry. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  It's been out for two months. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=577.48s)]
*  We didn't see it before that. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=578.48s)]
*  I think the Bud Lite thing was probably so overwhelming that no one paid attention to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=579.84s)]
*  anything else. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=584.2800000000001s)]
*  And now that that's kind of died down. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=587.48s)]
*  It's all sort of stupid. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=588.48s)]
*  Since we're on alcohol and we're on all that stuff, let me do this so I don't forget because [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=589.48s)]
*  this is pretty amazing here. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=595.12s)]
*  I know you like cigars and as do I. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=596.6400000000001s)]
*  This right here, so these cigars right here, Hooten Young, the guy that we just talked [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=600.96s)]
*  about this, this whiskey, that Jack Carr edition right there. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=605.12s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=608.24s)]
*  Look at the label. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=609.24s)]
*  This is pretty cool. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=610.24s)]
*  So what they did, they called me and I was kind of like a million things going on and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=611.24s)]
*  I pick up and they started to talk to me about this and it gave me goosebumps. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=615.64s)]
*  And it's this right here is World Trade Center Steel. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=619.68s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=622.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=623.84s)]
*  World Trade Center Steel. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=624.84s)]
*  The guys that put this together aren't just Hooten Young, aren't just Norm Hooten. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=625.84s)]
*  There's some, I'm going to call them two Army Rangers and a special forces guy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=629.04s)]
*  We can talk more about them. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=634.68s)]
*  Just incredible human beings who have sacrificed so much for this nation. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=636.12s)]
*  And so they did this and then he kept talking to me and he said under these cigars, under [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=640.18s)]
*  each one right here, so if I pull one of these out, you can see that there is some dirt under [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  each one of these right here and it's laminated in there over the top. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=652.88s)]
*  So there's dirt and there's a little laminate over it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=656.64s)]
*  And each one of these comes from a special place. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=659.6s)]
*  And right here, D-Day invasion, sacred sand recovered from Omaha Beach in Normandy. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=668.04s)]
*  Right there. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=669.04s)]
*  Largest amphibious invasion in history. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=670.04s)]
*  So they have that there. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  Iranian hostage crisis, April 24th, 1980, Operation Eagle Claw. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  So that's when they went in to try to rescue the American hostages in Iran, Tehran, and [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=678.68s)]
*  they landed at a place called Desert One. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=682.72s)]
*  One of the refueling birds hit one of the refueling C-130s hit one of the helicopters [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=684.96s)]
*  and there was an explosion and people died and they had to abort the mission. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=692.72s)]
*  They didn't have enough helicopters to keep going, so they brought dirt back from that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=697.52s)]
*  There is not much dirt that they brought back, but there is some in here. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=700.6s)]
*  And Battle of Mogadishu, October 3rd to 4th, 1993, Operation Gothic Serpent. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=705.52s)]
*  And smuggled from the Black Hawk Down crash site in Mogadishu, Somalia. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=714.88s)]
*  Under there. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=715.88s)]
*  World Trade Center attack, Operation Enduring Freedom, the steel right here. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=716.88s)]
*  And Saddam Hussein, Operation Iraqi Freedom from March 20th, 2003. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=721.88s)]
*  So there is dirt from some amazing dates in special operations and military history in [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=727.0799999999999s)]
*  here. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=734.48s)]
*  And each one of these cigars, you can tell right here, has, there you go, right here. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=735.48s)]
*  You right there. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=739.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=742.4399999999999s)]
*  Amazing, yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  Hoot and Young and then some guys that are out there at the tip of the spear that have [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=744.4399999999999s)]
*  access to this dirt from places like Operation Eagle Claw, Desert One outside of Tehran, Iran, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=749.24s)]
*  is in here. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=754.24s)]
*  Wow, put that back in. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=755.24s)]
*  We're going to save these for some special occasion. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=756.24s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=759.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=760.24s)]
*  So I was blown away. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=761.24s)]
*  So they made one for you, made one for me, and so we're the only two people to have these. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=762.24s)]
*  That's very cool. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=767.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=768.24s)]
*  Operator cigars right there. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=769.24s)]
*  And there you are. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=770.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=771.44s)]
*  Hoot and Young, across Tomahawks right there. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=772.44s)]
*  Yeah, pretty amazing. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=774.44s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=776.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=777.44s)]
*  Have you smoked one of these yet? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=778.44s)]
*  Not yet, not yet. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=779.44s)]
*  Just, it arrived just hours before I got here. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=780.44s)]
*  So, pretty cool. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=783.44s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=784.44s)]
*  That's very cool. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=785.44s)]
*  So thank you guys, Hoot and Young, and the guys at the tip of the spear who put this [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=786.44s)]
*  together. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=789.44s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=790.44s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=791.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely amazing. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=792.44s)]
*  And this stuff launches, I think today, you have to wait for the government. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=793.44s)]
*  There's all sorts of things you have to hop through, you know, before they approve it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=795.44s)]
*  The whiskey? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=798.44s)]
*  Yeah, they approve it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=799.6400000000001s)]
*  And so this stuff, I think it's launching tomorrow, or today when this thing launches. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=800.6400000000001s)]
*  So that'll be out there. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=803.6400000000001s)]
*  And what's crazy is you have to go through these patent things, so not like trademark [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=805.6400000000001s)]
*  stuff with attorneys and things, and there's different little categories. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=809.0400000000001s)]
*  So you have to have subcategories if you want to patent across Tomahawks. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=812.24s)]
*  So I have lawyers doing all that, and part of that's whiskey. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=816.8800000000001s)]
*  And so they did the whiskey one, and right away the Jack Daniels lawyers, boom, right [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=820.1400000000001s)]
*  on it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=824.6400000000001s)]
*  They are very aggressive when it comes to any whiskey that has Jack in it, even though [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=825.84s)]
*  it's obviously a different label, different style bottle, different, no connection. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=829.24s)]
*  They get upset at the name Jack? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=833.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=835.76s)]
*  Jack Carr? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=836.76s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=837.76s)]
*  Don't they just look at it and go, oh, that's the author? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=838.76s)]
*  Come on, Jack Daniels. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=840.76s)]
*  Seriously, Jack Daniels has done so much for America's... [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=842.76s)]
*  We love you, Jack Daniels. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=844.76s)]
*  Don't be cunts. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=845.76s)]
*  We love Jack Daniels. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=846.76s)]
*  I know. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=847.76s)]
*  Seriously, but they did something with, they had like a dog poop thing that was out there [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=848.76s)]
*  with Jack Daniels on it or something like that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=854.64s)]
*  You can look that up, but it was a big thing. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=857.28s)]
*  I think it went to the Supreme Court recently. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=858.28s)]
*  So point being, they're very aggressive. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=860.0s)]
*  We do love Jack Daniels, but their lawyers get a little aggressive and juxtapose that, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=861.6s)]
*  because while you're doing this, yeah, there it is, right there. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=865.48s)]
*  Whiskey and poop thing dog toy meet in a trademark clash. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=868.56s)]
*  Oh boy, that's lawyers. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=871.76s)]
*  That's just lawyers. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=873.52s)]
*  Got a bunch of people that probably work for the firm, and they're like, oh, this is an [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=874.52s)]
*  opportunity to get on the board. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=878.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they get very aggressive, but you juxtapose that, so there's also Carr Wine. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=880.12s)]
*  So we happen to drink a lot of that in our household. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=884.56s)]
*  My dog has one of those. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=888.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=889.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=890.68s)]
*  Marshall has one of those. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=891.68s)]
*  He's got a fake Jack Daniels. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=892.68s)]
*  As a matter of fact, there might be a photo of him with it on his Instagram page. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=893.68s)]
*  My dog's Instagram has like 750,000 followers. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=899.28s)]
*  Blowing up. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=901.9599999999999s)]
*  He's so handsome. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=902.9599999999999s)]
*  That is awesome. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  He's adorable. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  That is awesome. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=905.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure in one of his photos, he's got a rubber bottle of Jack Daniels. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  That might have spurred this whole lawsuit. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=911.76s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=913.48s)]
*  But point being, there's also Carr Wine. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=914.48s)]
*  There he is. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=917.48s)]
*  There it is right there. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=918.48s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=919.48s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=920.48s)]
*  That is a great shot. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=921.48s)]
*  So they should be excited. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=923.96s)]
*  That's his best position. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=925.8s)]
*  His favorite position is cuddling. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=928.0s)]
*  When you watch TV, he hops on board and just puts his head on your chest. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=930.8s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=933.88s)]
*  We do love Jack Daniels. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=934.88s)]
*  They do so much for the military. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=935.88s)]
*  I do love Jack Daniels. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=936.88s)]
*  It's not them. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=937.88s)]
*  It's some lawyers. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=938.88s)]
*  Some dipshits. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=939.88s)]
*  Also, Jack Daniels has been around for what? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=941.0s)]
*  A hundred years plus? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=943.64s)]
*  Long time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=944.64s)]
*  How long have they been around? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=945.64s)]
*  So it's not really Jack Daniels. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=946.64s)]
*  No. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=947.64s)]
*  It's people that assume a position at Jack Daniels and go after dog toys. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=948.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=953.08s)]
*  And anything with Jack in the title. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=954.08s)]
*  So hopefully we can work through that. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=955.52s)]
*  But different than the lawyers for Carr Wine. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=957.4s)]
*  So same situation. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=959.48s)]
*  You have to do wine is separate than liquor and that sort of thing with trademarks and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=960.48s)]
*  all that. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=963.76s)]
*  And so Carr Wine reaches out, but they're like, hey, excuse us. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=964.76s)]
*  We're big fans, but I love what Jack's doing. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=969.12s)]
*  But what do you guys plan on doing with this wine? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=972.24s)]
*  It's really just kind of a series of things you just do when you apply for a trademark [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=974.04s)]
*  just to cover things. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=977.88s)]
*  And they were awesome. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=979.16s)]
*  And I was like, these guys are so fun. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=980.16s)]
*  We drink their wine anyway. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=981.6s)]
*  Been drinking it for years. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=982.6s)]
*  And I was like, hey, just tell them if they are, if I ever do a wine that if they were [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=983.88s)]
*  uncomfortable with it, I'll just change it up. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=987.96s)]
*  Just whatever they wanted. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=989.72s)]
*  You know, it'll be totally different anyway. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=990.72s)]
*  But I'll show it to them first. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=992.56s)]
*  So I told the attorneys, like, just tell them I'll whatever. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=993.56s)]
*  Well, let's get some wine together. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=995.92s)]
*  So was the company named Carr Wine? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=997.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=999.5s)]
*  Yes, there's Carr Wine, Carr Vineyards, maybe in Northern California, I think. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1000.5s)]
*  And they're out there in all the grocery stores and they're pretty big. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1004.5s)]
*  But they're good, you know, good solid wine. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1008.6999999999999s)]
*  But they were cool about it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1010.3s)]
*  Yeah, super cool. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1011.3s)]
*  Super cool. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1012.3s)]
*  Yeah, their lawyers reached out. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1013.3s)]
*  But it's the same situation. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1014.3s)]
*  But you can be cool or you cannot be cool. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1015.3s)]
*  Be cool like Fonzie. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1017.62s)]
*  Just be cool like Fonzie. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1018.62s)]
*  How hard is this? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1019.62s)]
*  God. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1020.62s)]
*  Well, it's lawyers. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1021.62s)]
*  I mean, it's also that's their job. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1022.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's their job. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1025.62s)]
*  The scorpion and the frog. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1026.62s)]
*  It's in my nature. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1027.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1028.62s)]
*  And they're there to protect. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1029.62s)]
*  So I do. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1030.62s)]
*  I do get it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1031.62s)]
*  But yeah, you know, that's OK. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1032.62s)]
*  We still be nice about it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1033.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1034.62s)]
*  Well, hopefully this podcast will maybe lube the gears a little bit. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1035.62s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1039.62s)]
*  Be cool. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1040.62s)]
*  You know. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1041.62s)]
*  So are you guys is season two, it's on hold now because of the writer's strike? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1042.62s)]
*  Well, working on the scripts. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1046.62s)]
*  So it's. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1048.1399999999999s)]
*  Are you allowed to work on the scripts? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1049.1399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1050.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'm not part of the guild yet. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1051.1399999999999s)]
*  I would be after this one because I'm writing the finale. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1052.1399999999999s)]
*  But out of respect for what they have going on. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1053.9399999999998s)]
*  I'm pencils down on it, too. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1056.42s)]
*  So all the writers that are part of the WGA pencils down on all their projects right now. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1057.74s)]
*  So the writers guild is only television and film. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1063.54s)]
*  It has nothing to do with authors, nothing to do with publishing industry as far as the [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1066.34s)]
*  books and Simon and Schuster and all that stuff. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1070.1399999999999s)]
*  And same thing with video games. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1072.06s)]
*  I learned video games because there are writers for these video games. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1073.06s)]
*  And that's not part of it either. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1075.82s)]
*  So people can work on that stuff. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1078.06s)]
*  But it's the television and film. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1079.32s)]
*  And is the main dispute streaming? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1080.92s)]
*  Is that what's going on? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1082.62s)]
*  It's been a long time coming. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1084.2199999999998s)]
*  So that was coming to a head anyway. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1086.3s)]
*  And they probably should have negotiated or not. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1087.9799999999998s)]
*  They should have. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1089.1s)]
*  It's been a long time in the works just because things have changed so much since the last [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1090.54s)]
*  writer strike when it comes to streaming. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1093.3799999999999s)]
*  But then right when that comes to a head, AI hits the news this January. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1095.9399999999998s)]
*  AI with chat GPT and all that stuff. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1099.3s)]
*  And people are putting it as you've seen. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1101.58s)]
*  People can just say, hey, write a show about X, Y or Z and pops out. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1103.54s)]
*  Not bad. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1107.2399999999998s)]
*  Do a little editing. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1108.2399999999998s)]
*  Off it goes. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1109.2399999999998s)]
*  And you don't have to pay a writer's room. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1110.2399999999998s)]
*  And if you're an executive and you're beholden to, I guess, shareholders or whatever it is, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1111.86s)]
*  maybe that's attractive. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1115.56s)]
*  But not so attractive to those people who make their living coming up with these ideas [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1116.64s)]
*  in a writer's room and then making all this money. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  Essentially the foundation of everything that we see in film and television happens in those [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1123.1200000000001s)]
*  writer's rooms and happens from these creators. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1127.08s)]
*  And a lot of them, it's not huge money they're making anyway. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1129.76s)]
*  But it's just how do you deal with streaming and how do we deal with AI? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1133.28s)]
*  And we'll see. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1136.36s)]
*  What is the solution to the AI problem? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1137.36s)]
*  We're dealing with chat GPT 4 now. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1139.4799999999998s)]
*  And as chat GPT 5, 6 and 7 roll out, I would imagine they're going to be able to write [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1142.7199999999998s)]
*  in the style of Jack Carr and write a perfect James Reese novel. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1147.7199999999998s)]
*  Maybe eventually. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1153.0s)]
*  Somebody did that right when it came out. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1154.0s)]
*  I think in January I got a text and I said, check your email. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1155.0s)]
*  This is what I just screen shot of chat GPT. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1157.0s)]
*  I said, write the first novel or first chapter in the next Jack Carr, James Reese terminalist [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1158.84s)]
*  thing. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1163.24s)]
*  And it was wasn't great, but in five years it probably will be. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1164.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1167.12s)]
*  And even if it's not great, it maybe is a scaffolding for an actual writer to go in [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  and put some real flair to it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1172.6799999999998s)]
*  This new book is really good. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1175.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1176.6799999999998s)]
*  Like I said, I think I'm on chapter 24 or 25. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1177.6799999999998s)]
*  And you're writing, I liked how you're shift, you switch your styles up a little bit. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1181.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1187.28s)]
*  You know, like there's like new elements to the way you do things. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1188.28s)]
*  Like I don't want to give anything away. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1191.32s)]
*  But when Reese is incarcerated. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1193.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1197.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1198.44s)]
*  There's like, there's something to the way you're doing it differently. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1199.44s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1202.0s)]
*  Cause you don't have the same novel every time. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1203.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1204.6s)]
*  Just you pick some up, somebody up and he's a carbon cutout and you drop him now in Europe. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1205.6s)]
*  Now he's getting revenge. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1208.68s)]
*  Now he's in Africa, getting revenge. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1209.68s)]
*  Now he's in China. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1210.68s)]
*  So I wanted to avoid that. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1211.68s)]
*  And that was right out of the gate. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1213.92s)]
*  I was, I was cognizant of that being something that could be an issue if you have a success, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1215.2s)]
*  just kind of copy that. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1220.32s)]
*  And I never wanted to do that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1221.32s)]
*  I always want to evolve just like anything else in life. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1222.3999999999999s)]
*  I think in the SEAL teams, my whole mission was to be a better operator and a better leader [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1225.24s)]
*  today than I was yesterday. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1228.6s)]
*  Personal front, be a better husband and father than I was yesterday. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1230.72s)]
*  And for writing, be a better author for the next book than I was for this one. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1233.4s)]
*  I want my next sentence to be better than the sentence before. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1236.28s)]
*  So it's, so this one, James Reese is on a journey. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1240.0s)]
*  And that's one of the one things that we have in common just with everyone else on this [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1243.12s)]
*  planet. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1246.8799999999999s)]
*  We're all on a journey. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1247.8799999999999s)]
*  There's no, no matter your race, your religion, your socioeconomic background, you're on a [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  journey and you don't know how much time you have on this planet. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1252.56s)]
*  You get one ride and so got to make it count. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1255.24s)]
*  So people are trusting me with that time, which is something I take extremely seriously. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1258.04s)]
*  So as much thought goes into any Instagram post or blog or question for a guest on my [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1262.12s)]
*  podcast or whatever it is, as goes into any sentence in the novel. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1266.0s)]
*  And I want to always improve on that craft every single time. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1269.12s)]
*  So James Reese is on this journey. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1271.92s)]
*  He's not the same guy he was in the first book, not the same guy who was in the third. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1273.24s)]
*  And he's not the same guy he is in the sixth one. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1276.08s)]
*  He's evolving. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1278.4s)]
*  Taking those past successes and failures and taking those lessons and applying them forward. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1280.16s)]
*  Hopefully his wisdom. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1284.52s)]
*  Hopefully we're all doing that except for Bud Light and Miller Light, apparently. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1285.52s)]
*  But they'll learn to. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1288.68s)]
*  They need to read these novels, perhaps. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1290.5600000000002s)]
*  And they're only down 21 percent. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1293.4s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1295.4s)]
*  And that's more than a rounding error. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1296.4s)]
*  That's more than a rounding error. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1299.92s)]
*  That's a real number. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1300.92s)]
*  That's tough to come back from. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1301.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1302.92s)]
*  Well, it's interesting now is gay bars are now boycotting them because they didn't back [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1303.92s)]
*  up Dylan Mulvaney. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1308.28s)]
*  I saw they can't win. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1309.52s)]
*  They just waded into this thing. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1311.48s)]
*  It's like an L ambush. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1312.64s)]
*  You walk in and you're getting hit from all sides and you're kind of cover up. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1313.64s)]
*  And then they did that one post. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1316.2s)]
*  They put like their first one after that. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1317.76s)]
*  It was they put the Bud Light can and they said TGIF question mark. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1319.24s)]
*  But what they should have done. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1325.4s)]
*  This is, you know, hindsight. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1326.4s)]
*  They should have laid low. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1327.4s)]
*  Well, they could lay low and hope that somebody else messes up like Miller Light here a few [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1328.4s)]
*  weeks later, even though it was before. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1331.88s)]
*  The Miller Light one is very mild. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1334.1200000000001s)]
*  It's pretty mild, but it's kind of a. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1336.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just silly. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1337.68s)]
*  It's just like you're you're you're also attacking women. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1338.68s)]
*  You're attacking these girls that are fitness models. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1342.6000000000001s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being a fitness fitness model, just like there's nothing wrong [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1345.8400000000001s)]
*  with being a male fitness influencer. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1349.0400000000002s)]
*  One of those guys that does like a lot of posts on lifting weights and technique and [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1351.24s)]
*  they're shirtless and they look jacked. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1354.88s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1356.68s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being a beautiful woman who makes a living taking photographs [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1357.68s)]
*  with beer. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1363.0800000000002s)]
*  No, guys that drink Miller Light like that. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1364.0800000000002s)]
*  It's this narrow view of what a woman is supposed to be, that a woman is only supposed [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1366.52s)]
*  to be a lady who's succeeding and killing it in the corporate world. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1371.6399999999999s)]
*  And like, why? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1376.6399999999999s)]
*  This is why I saw another one who was similar to that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1377.6399999999999s)]
*  So they said, why are we vilifying women that stay home and raise kids and handle the household [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1380.32s)]
*  and that sort of thing, but celebrating the men pretending to be women who stay home and [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1385.84s)]
*  do the same thing? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1391.12s)]
*  It's kind of like that juxtaposition. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1392.12s)]
*  Those dichotomies are interesting. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1393.84s)]
*  Well, particularly in the way they dress, right? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1395.36s)]
*  Because one of the things about trans people is that like you'll celebrate the most stereotypical [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1397.6399999999999s)]
*  like image of what a woman is, like short skirts and a lot of makeup and fake eyelashes [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1405.6399999999999s)]
*  and like elbow high gloves and the whole deal. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1411.46s)]
*  It's like it's a caricature of what it's drag. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1415.04s)]
*  Like what is drag? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1417.6399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1418.6399999999999s)]
*  It's the most ridiculous version of what a woman is and it's celebrated. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1419.64s)]
*  But an actual woman like that is disparaged. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1425.24s)]
*  We live in interesting times. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1428.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think of Bud Light. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1429.3200000000002s)]
*  I remember that scene from the Hangover where Bradley Cooper, they pull over to the side [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1430.3200000000002s)]
*  and he's on the road, they're all beat up and he's covered in dust and everything. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1434.0800000000002s)]
*  And he takes that phone call and he's like, man, we fucked up. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  Like if they just played that clip, like that 10 second clip, people would have been like, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1440.6000000000001s)]
*  yeah, just put that up. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1445.88s)]
*  Just put it up. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1446.88s)]
*  And people would have been like, okay, all right, everybody screws up. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1448.1200000000001s)]
*  Everybody messes up. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1450.92s)]
*  You know, we're all trying to navigate this kind of new world and we're all trying to [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1451.92s)]
*  do the best we can. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1455.0400000000002s)]
*  I went on a Bud Light tour back in 2007. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1456.0400000000002s)]
*  Me and Charlie Murphy and John Heffron, we went on a Real Men of Comedy Bud Light tour. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1459.48s)]
*  Nice. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1464.48s)]
*  Like Real Men of Genius or whatever that was? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1465.48s)]
*  The guy from Survivor was with us. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1466.8000000000002s)]
*  Jeff Probst? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1470.0400000000002s)]
*  The guy that... [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1471.0400000000002s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1472.0400000000002s)]
*  The band. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1473.0400000000002s)]
*  Like is the eye of the tiger? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1474.0400000000002s)]
*  Nice. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1475.0400000000002s)]
*  The guys that would sing the song Real Men of Genius. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1476.2s)]
*  Oh, no way. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1478.3999999999999s)]
*  I do remember those. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1479.3999999999999s)]
*  I did not know that was Survivor. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1480.3999999999999s)]
*  Really funny. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1481.3999999999999s)]
*  Those were funny ads. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1482.3999999999999s)]
*  And those guys did those ads in front of the audience. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1483.3999999999999s)]
*  So it was like, yeah, it was a fun tour. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1486.84s)]
*  And that gentleman has passed away, the Survivor guy. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1489.48s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1492.44s)]
*  As the lead singer of Survivor, didn't he pass away? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1493.44s)]
*  Super fucking cool guy though. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1495.6399999999999s)]
*  What a hell of a voice too. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1497.0s)]
*  Yeah, so we get to hang out with those guys and travel the country with them for a month. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1498.44s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  We had 22 dates and I got to become friends with Charlie and Heffron and we traveled around. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1502.92s)]
*  That was when Bud Light embraced this humorous, sort of dopey man version of beer, which is [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1509.1200000000001s)]
*  like what everybody likes. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1517.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1519.16s)]
*  Do you know Shane Gillis? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1520.16s)]
*  One of the best comics in the country. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1521.16s)]
*  Fucking top shelf. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1524.16s)]
*  If I saw him I'd know it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1525.16s)]
*  He's a new guy coming up. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1526.16s)]
*  But anyway, he drinks Bud Light and he's in a dilemma. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1528.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1530.8000000000002s)]
*  He drank Bud Light on the podcast and we've had podcasts where he drank 16 Bud Lights. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1531.84s)]
*  16 in three hours. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1535.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's a big boy. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1536.9199999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1537.9199999999998s)]
*  Big fella. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1538.9199999999998s)]
*  It's all relative. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1539.9199999999998s)]
*  He can put them down. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1540.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's all relative. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1541.9199999999998s)]
*  He can throw down some fucking beer. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1542.9199999999998s)]
*  That's amazing though. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1543.9199999999998s)]
*  Even how big you are. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1544.9199999999998s)]
*  That's pretty serious. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1545.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't even know how the fluid. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1546.9199999999998s)]
*  How many did you do? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1547.9199999999998s)]
*  Were you joining him? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1548.9199999999998s)]
*  I just can't keep up with that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1549.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm six, seven in, I'm done. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1551.32s)]
*  I can't stop peeing. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1553.32s)]
*  That's pretty good though, three hours you had to pee and everything. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1554.32s)]
*  Bud Light is a light beer. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1556.2s)]
*  It's only like, what is the percentage of alcohol? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1557.56s)]
*  5%? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1560.1599999999999s)]
*  It's light. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1561.52s)]
*  It's a lot like water. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1562.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's for people who like to drink all day long. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1563.52s)]
*  You can hydrate with it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1565.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you can hydrate with it. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1566.8000000000002s)]
*  You don't have to worry about it. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1567.8000000000002s)]
*  You get a nice little buzz, you hydrate, it's not offensive tasting. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1568.8000000000002s)]
*  No, now it's just offensive. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1573.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's just one ad campaign. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1575.8000000000002s)]
*  It's just so dumb and the lady behind it was her. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1577.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1580.92s)]
*  It was just like talking about the fratty sense of humor. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1581.92s)]
*  Like what are you going to do? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1585.3200000000002s)]
*  Are you going to replace it with this fucking mentally ill person? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1586.3200000000002s)]
*  I know, it's tough. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1589.0800000000002s)]
*  It just needs attention constantly. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1591.0s)]
*  I mean they had a winning campaign going for decades. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1592.0s)]
*  It worked. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1595.8s)]
*  Yeah, they should have gone back to another real men of genius. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1596.8s)]
*  Listen, you can make fun of men hardcore in those ads and we'll laugh along with you. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1599.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1605.4399999999998s)]
*  It would have been fine. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1606.4399999999998s)]
*  And they would have got people to buy Bud Light, which you got the opposite. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1608.4399999999998s)]
*  Now the gay folks don't want it, the trans folks don't want it. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1613.6s)]
*  Nobody wants it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1616.76s)]
*  Everybody's mad at you. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1617.76s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1618.76s)]
*  I read this story where this bar owner was saying that he had to stop carrying it because [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1620.44s)]
*  people were attacking people that were drinking it. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1624.08s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1626.44s)]
*  So people that were like, ah fuck it, I don't care, I'm not involved in this. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1627.44s)]
*  What are you, fucking communist? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1630.2s)]
*  People just beating people's asses for having Bud Light. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1631.2s)]
*  They were having fights at the bars. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1634.32s)]
*  It's so sad. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1636.26s)]
*  I think who are they owned by now? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1637.26s)]
*  Aren't they owned by some international corporation at this point? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1638.26s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1640.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1641.4s)]
*  Are they owned by a Chinese corporation? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1642.4s)]
*  Who owns Bud Light? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1644.44s)]
*  I think somebody in Europe. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1646.56s)]
*  Yeah, who owns Anheuser-Busch? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1648.24s)]
*  Let's find out who owns Anheuser-Busch. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1650.12s)]
*  That's a European company, isn't it? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1651.12s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1652.6s)]
*  But whatever's something bad, I blame it on China. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1653.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1655.6s)]
*  Those headlights, like those lights that you got, you know? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1656.6s)]
*  Oh, the ones from my Land Cruiser. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1659.72s)]
*  Those actually were from China. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1661.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1662.2s)]
*  They would look cool, they just died. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1663.2s)]
*  They got water in them somehow or another. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1664.2s)]
*  How are you, fucking Land Cruiser. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1666.24s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1668.44s)]
*  How are they not sealed? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1669.44s)]
*  I guess a company called InBev bought it. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1670.44s)]
*  I've never heard of that. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1672.64s)]
*  What's InBev? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1674.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1675.2s)]
*  It's tied to the communist. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1676.2s)]
*  I want to short them right now. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1677.68s)]
*  I want to call my broker. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1679.28s)]
*  I got a feeling this is going to keep going. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1682.5600000000002s)]
*  Belgian multinational. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1684.8s)]
*  Belgium. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1685.8s)]
*  Yeah, let's manipulate some markets right now. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1686.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1687.8s)]
*  I think you could. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1688.8s)]
*  Let's take a break, don't we? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1689.8s)]
*  Make a couple calls. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1690.8s)]
*  So we have this podcast that we do called Protect Our Parks that I do with Shane Gillis, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1691.8s)]
*  Ari Shafir, and Mark Normand, and we get hammered, like most of the time. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1695.8400000000001s)]
*  And we're trying to figure out what's the least woke beer to drink. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1700.48s)]
*  And Mark Normand said Colt 45. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1704.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think he's right. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1707.48s)]
*  Is he? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1708.48s)]
*  Well, who owns it? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1709.48s)]
*  We got to look it up. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1710.48s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1711.48s)]
*  I don't know, but Colt 45. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1712.48s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1713.48s)]
*  That is the least woke advertising campaign. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1714.48s)]
*  It was. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1715.48s)]
*  I remember growing up, those commercials were fantastic. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1716.48s)]
*  Malt liquor. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1718.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1719.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, that stuff is, what is the alcohol percentage of that? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1720.4399999999998s)]
*  That stuff is brutal. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1722.8s)]
*  It's more than Bud Light. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1723.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1724.8s)]
*  A lot more. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1725.8s)]
*  That stuff's rough. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1726.8s)]
*  That's not even real beer. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1727.8s)]
*  It's malt liquor. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1728.8s)]
*  It's 5.6. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1729.8s)]
*  Malt liquor is? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1730.8s)]
*  Well, Colt 45 is according to Wikipedia. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1731.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1732.8s)]
*  What about Old English? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1733.8s)]
*  It's an old, it's an old, it's a SIOP, psychological operation. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1735.52s)]

*  So I said like, if you catch a fish, no one's upset at you. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1992.5200000000002s)]
*  And then I showed a picture of me with a dead turkey like, we're crossing into a weird area, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1995.3200000000002s)]
*  but nobody cares. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=1999.7600000000002s)]
*  And then I had a package of bear meat. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2000.7600000000002s)]
*  Just a package, just meat. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2003.7600000000002s)]
*  It just said bear meat. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2004.7600000000002s)]
*  And it's like, you can get away with a lot. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2005.7600000000002s)]
*  You do it in a sneaky way. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2008.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, bear meat. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2009.2s)]
*  And that's okay. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2010.88s)]
*  That was okay, right? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2011.88s)]
*  Not too many people hating that. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2012.88s)]
*  Yeah, the hierarchy of dead animals on social media. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2013.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2016.88s)]
*  When did you put, May 1st, 2015? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2017.88s)]
*  Gosh, eight years ago. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2020.88s)]
*  Eight years ago. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2022.88s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2023.88s)]
*  Yeah, that was probably last time I hunted bears. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2024.88s)]
*  Was it? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2026.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2027.88s)]
*  I haven't been up there in a while. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2028.88s)]
*  There was the pandemic and then you couldn't get up there for a while. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2029.88s)]
*  Now I'm just angry at Canada. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2033.88s)]
*  Yeah, they've been in touch and want to try to get me up there. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2035.88s)]
*  It's a crazy spot. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2039.88s)]
*  They have so many bears up there. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2040.88s)]
*  Anyone that thinks that somehow or another bears, they're a protected species. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2042.88s)]
*  Listen, go to Canada. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2045.88s)]
*  Go to Alberta. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2048.88s)]
*  And go wander around the woods. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2049.88s)]
*  There are so many goddamn bears. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2051.88s)]
*  They have to kill bears. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2053.88s)]
*  Their deer population, their moose population, all depends on it. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2055.88s)]
*  They are overrun with bears. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2059.88s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2060.88s)]
*  When we were up there, there's bear cannibalism. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2061.88s)]
*  John, one of the guys that was, Jonathan, one of the sons of the rivets, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2064.88s)]
*  he saw a bear, a male bear, the boar, attacked a female and was trying to get to her cubs, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2069.88s)]
*  killed one of her cubs. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2078.88s)]
*  The female chased the bear off and then the female ate her own cub. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2080.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2084.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2085.88s)]
*  These aren't teddy bears. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2086.88s)]
*  They're edible monsters. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2088.88s)]
*  Did you post a picture of your bear at one point and that's where the hatred, there was a lot of hate? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2090.88s)]
*  Oh, I got a lot of hate for that. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2095.88s)]
*  They posted it. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2097.88s)]
*  That's the only thing. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2098.88s)]
*  Alaskan monsters, bears go at it. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2099.88s)]
*  This is the longest, most intense grizzly bear fight he's seen. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2101.88s)]
*  Oh, jeez. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2104.88s)]
*  Did you miss it? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2105.88s)]
*  No, I've got some by your reaction. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2106.88s)]
*  You did not see this. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2107.88s)]
*  This is May 11th. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2108.88s)]
*  This is a few days ago. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2109.88s)]

*  This is a few days ago here. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2111.88s)]
*  This is an intense fight. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2112.88s)]
*  Is this new? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2113.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty new. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2114.88s)]
*  Oh, I haven't seen this one. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2115.88s)]
*  May 11th this year. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2116.88s)]
*  I mean, we could go into, I don't, it's long. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2117.88s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2118.88s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2119.88s)]
*  That is cruel. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2120.88s)]
*  That's nature's cleanup crew, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2121.88s)]
*  Anything that fucks up gets eaten by this 2,000 pound monster. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2123.88s)]
*  And here comes this guy. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2127.88s)]
*  This dude is just going to happen dangerously close to us. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2128.88s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2133.88s)]

*  Gosh. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2138.88s)]
*  Look at that backdrop. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2139.88s)]
*  People will say it's CGI. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2142.88s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2147.88s)]
*  Weird life they have. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2148.88s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2149.88s)]
*  I mean, that looks pretty evenly matched at this point. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2150.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're both the same size. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2153.88s)]
*  I mean, it's... [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2154.88s)]
*  They just bite in each other's faces. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2155.88s)]
*  He's been training harder. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2156.88s)]
*  Fuck, man. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2157.88s)]
*  They do a lot of jujitsu though. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2158.88s)]
*  Look, right there, those little grammy roll. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2160.88s)]
*  There it is. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2162.88s)]
*  Oh, going for the back. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2163.88s)]
*  He's got it in the back. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2164.88s)]
*  He's been watching UFC. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2165.88s)]

*  Yeah, he's just biting chunks out of his back. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2167.88s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2169.88s)]
*  And that guy's trying to get away now. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2170.88s)]
*  He's trying to... [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2171.88s)]
*  But they're thick. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2172.88s)]
*  Too late. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2173.88s)]
*  Their skin is so thick and they're covered in fat. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2174.88s)]
*  He looks like... [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2175.88s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2176.88s)]
*  That's just annoying. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2177.88s)]
*  Like, broke it off, man. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2178.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2179.88s)]
*  I will say this goes on and on and on. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2180.88s)]

*  Oh my gosh. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2187.88s)]
*  I like how the other bear just keeps moving though. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2189.52s)]
*  That's good. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2191.7200000000003s)]
*  I like his technique. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2192.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, there he goes. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2193.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2194.7200000000003s)]
*  The guy's still got his back, but he's in the wrong... [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2195.7200000000003s)]
*  Trying to reverse. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2196.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, he's pulled guard. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2197.7200000000003s)]
*  Trying to get him off of him. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2198.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2199.7200000000003s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2200.7200000000003s)]
*  That one better run. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2201.7200000000003s)]
*  That one better just get on those getaway sticks. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2202.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2205.7200000000003s)]
*  I feel like the other guy's going to gas out. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2206.96s)]
*  Yeah, we're good. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2209.52s)]
*  We're good. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2210.52s)]
*  I'm watching. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2211.52s)]
*  He's wasting all his time biting him in the back. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2213.16s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he's going for the spine or like... [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2214.16s)]
*  Eh. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2217.16s)]
*  No? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2218.16s)]
*  It's not really going to happen. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2219.16s)]
*  No. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2220.16s)]
*  I don't think anyone dies. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2221.16s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2222.16s)]

*  It's a crazy fight. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2224.16s)]
*  Well, you know who got the best bear fight footage before this was Grizzly Man. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2225.16s)]
*  Which is one of my favorite all time comedies. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2230.36s)]
*  I haven't... [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2232.24s)]
*  It's the best... [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2233.24s)]
*  I haven't watched it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2234.24s)]
*  You haven't watched it? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2235.24s)]
*  No, I keep meaning to it. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2236.24s)]
*  I haven't watched it, but I know it. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2237.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2238.24s)]
*  Have a cocktail and watch Grizzly Man. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2239.24s)]
*  It is the best unintentional comedy that's ever been made. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2240.3599999999997s)]
*  And I wonder if it's unintentional because Werner Herzog is a genius. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2243.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2247.52s)]
*  You know, and he's made so many amazing films and that to me is his favorite. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2248.52s)]
*  My favorite is his films. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2252.64s)]
*  And there's so many moments that just are laugh out loud funny. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2254.6s)]
*  Like there's one where there's a sheriff and he's talking about like finding the body and [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2258.64s)]
*  the fact this guy was camping with him. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2262.0s)]
*  And the sheriff looks at the camera and goes, I thought he was retarded. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2263.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like the way he says it. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2266.24s)]
*  And then he cuts, there's a smash cut and like... [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2270.68s)]
*  The bear guy always gets eaten by the bear. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2273.2400000000002s)]
*  The shark guy ends up getting eaten by the shark. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2275.32s)]
*  The rattlesnake guy ends up getting bit by the rattlesnake. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2277.08s)]
*  What's happening with these? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2280.0s)]
*  That's just the trailer for... [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2281.0s)]
*  Oh, for Grizzly Man. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2283.0s)]
*  Yeah, that poor guy. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2284.0s)]
*  Well that guy was very, very sad. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2285.76s)]
*  He was a sad guy. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2288.2s)]
*  And he had this idea that he was protecting them. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2290.12s)]
*  But he just doesn't even understand. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2292.7200000000003s)]
*  He doesn't understand wildlife conservation. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2294.92s)]
*  That's so brutal. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2297.64s)]
*  The lion guy gets eaten by the lion. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2300.8s)]
*  It's always the way. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2302.6800000000003s)]
*  But this one's... [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2303.7200000000003s)]
*  This is an amazing... [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2304.7200000000003s)]
*  Brilliant tale of adventure and potential madness and hilarious. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2305.7200000000003s)]
*  Well I think I feel like genuinely this story was suicide by bear. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2310.84s)]
*  Because he stayed long after you're supposed to be there. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2316.28s)]
*  He stayed after the animals were in hibernation. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2319.08s)]
*  He was very depressed. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2321.76s)]
*  And I think he kind of wanted to die. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2323.28s)]
*  I really do. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2326.2000000000003s)]
*  I just think this guy just was very sad. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2327.2000000000003s)]
*  And he very much seemed like an in the closet gay guy. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2329.84s)]
*  Because he said a lot of crazy shit. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2333.28s)]
*  He was walking around with a camera. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2335.08s)]
*  He goes, I wish I was gay. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2336.08s)]
*  If I was gay it would be so easy. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2337.08s)]
*  I just found a guy and hooked up. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2338.48s)]
*  But I'm not gay. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2339.48s)]
*  I'm like, are you sure? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2340.48s)]
*  There's so many layers to that film. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2342.48s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2345.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to watch it at some point. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2346.48s)]
*  It's great. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2347.48s)]
*  It's a great documentary. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2348.48s)]
*  And it also highlights how majestic these animals are. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2349.48s)]
*  They're so amazing. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2352.4s)]
*  And delicious too if you get the right ones eating the right stuff. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2353.6s)]
*  I've never eaten a brown bear. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2355.88s)]
*  Nope, I have not eaten a brown bear. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2357.28s)]
*  Black bears are very good. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2358.28s)]
*  If they're eating the blueberries, just munching on those blueberries. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2359.28s)]
*  I haven't had that. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2362.28s)]
*  But Ronella says it's some of the best meat he's ever eaten. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2364.1200000000003s)]
*  It is. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2366.4s)]
*  What's interesting is that settlers in America in the pioneer days, they preferred bear meat [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2367.4s)]
*  and they shot deer for their skins. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2373.8s)]
*  Oh interesting. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2375.88s)]
*  That's why like a buck. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2376.88s)]
*  Do you know what a buck? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2377.88s)]
*  A buck deer. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2378.88s)]
*  A buck deer. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2379.88s)]
*  It's a dollar. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2380.88s)]
*  Because that was what it was worth. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2381.88s)]
*  One of those deer skins was worth a dollar. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2383.44s)]
*  So they called it a buck. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2385.6400000000003s)]
*  Which is kind of crazy. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2387.8s)]
*  Back then that's a lot of money. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2388.8s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2390.1600000000003s)]
*  Back then a dollar is a lot of money. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2391.1600000000003s)]
*  Get 20 of those, 30 of those, 50 of those, 100 of those. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2392.48s)]
*  You're fucking balling. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2394.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2395.44s)]
*  You know the richest guy in the world at one point in time was a beaver pelt salesman. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2396.44s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2400.76s)]
*  In America. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2401.76s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2402.76s)]
*  Yeah there was a time. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2403.76s)]
*  And it was just like the stock market. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2404.76s)]
*  The ups and downs in the markets for those things. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2405.76s)]
*  Did you see that recent, I think it was in Kenya. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2406.76s)]
*  I think I just saw it maybe yesterday or the day before. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2409.2000000000003s)]
*  But the villagers out there killed a lion. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2411.48s)]
*  An old lion. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2414.84s)]
*  And it made the news. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2415.88s)]
*  But not so much in the way that some of the others have. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2417.04s)]
*  Because this lion was eating some of their livestock. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2419.52s)]
*  And they're like, oh guess what? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2422.36s)]
*  This is killing our livestock. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2424.28s)]
*  That's how we survive. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2425.78s)]
*  So we're going to kill it. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2426.78s)]
*  So they did. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2428.54s)]
*  And of course you know when asked more questions about well why and why is there not hunting [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2430.1200000000003s)]
*  here and if there was hunting would that animal have had value and then would there be incentive [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2436.44s)]
*  to keep those populations at a certain level and apply the science to it and make sure. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2440.04s)]
*  But there's none of that. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2445.92s)]
*  They just kill it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2446.92s)]
*  And that's how it goes. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2447.92s)]
*  Because these things are killing your livestock that you feed your family with. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2448.92s)]
*  So it wasn't long for this earth. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2450.6600000000003s)]
*  That happens with elephants, with crops. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2452.42s)]
*  Oh they destroy a bunch of crops over there. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2454.42s)]
*  So what do they do? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2456.86s)]
*  They kill them. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2457.86s)]
*  They have no idea what a farm is. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2458.86s)]
*  They're not worried. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2459.86s)]
*  They're not worried. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2460.86s)]
*  It's just free food. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2461.86s)]
*  They just go through. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2462.86s)]
*  I've seen those videos, those pictures. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2463.86s)]
*  But that's the problem about not putting the requisite time, energy and effort into studying [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2466.1s)]
*  an issue. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2469.86s)]
*  No matter what that issue is. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2470.86s)]
*  And just making a snap decision based on something that someone with a lot of followers puts [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2471.86s)]
*  out there. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2475.12s)]
*  All of a sudden that's your position as well. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2476.12s)]
*  Rather than, hmm, let me just do some study here. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2479.2s)]
*  Let me think about this a little more. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2481.16s)]
*  And now I'll make my decision. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2482.64s)]
*  What's sort of like a woman attacking women for wearing bikinis? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2484.3199999999997s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2488.48s)]
*  You're ruining it for everyone. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2492.2s)]
*  There's something wrong with that. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2493.2s)]
*  And also there's the thing about wildlife conservation that's very uncomfortable. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2494.4s)]
*  And what's uncomfortable is that it really bothers us that the only way animals really [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2498.64s)]
*  have value in terms of these wild populations of antelope and gazelles and all these different [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2503.7s)]
*  things they hunt in Africa. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2511.8199999999997s)]
*  The way they've made them thrive is by putting value on them to hunt them. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2512.98s)]
*  And that bothers people a lot. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2518.42s)]
*  It does. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2520.02s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2521.02s)]
*  I get why it would. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2522.02s)]
*  I mean it would be nice if all these people that were animal conservationists spent as [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2523.02s)]
*  much money as hunters. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2527.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but it doesn't happen that way. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2528.8599999999997s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2530.8599999999997s)]
*  Nope. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2531.8599999999997s)]
*  In America, with the Pittman Robertson Act, where a percentage of all ammunition sales, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2533.02s)]
*  of all gear, all hunting gear, and it turns into all that goes towards wildlife conservation, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2540.38s)]
*  it's the tune of billions of dollars. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2546.54s)]
*  Yeah, and sportsmen voted that in. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2548.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2550.86s)]
*  Voted that in. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2551.86s)]
*  That was a tax, self-imposed tax. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2552.86s)]
*  Yes, and a beautiful one, really. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2553.86s)]
*  It's one of the wildlife conservation in this country and the preservation of public land [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2555.54s)]
*  for recreational use and hunting and fishing and camping is one of the greatest things [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2561.0600000000004s)]
*  this country has ever pioneered. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2565.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2567.0600000000004s)]
*  Because it really doesn't exist or hadn't exist until we did it in this country. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2568.0600000000004s)]
*  Oh yeah, out of necessity because all those bucks added up to a lot of dead deer and a [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2572.1400000000003s)]
*  lot of population decline. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2576.2200000000003s)]
*  But now we have thriving populations of these animals and turkeys also. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2578.3s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2583.1400000000003s)]
*  Now they're all over the place. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2584.1400000000003s)]
*  We have about 200 essentially that go between a ridge by our house, they come through every [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2585.2200000000003s)]
*  day up to this other ridge and then work their way back. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2589.14s)]
*  And I was heading up to see Steve Vanell in Montana a lot two weeks ago and I took a video. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2591.62s)]
*  He'd been out turkey hunting, didn't see anything. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2595.14s)]
*  And I took about 200 turkeys just standing there in the road as I'm leaving the house. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2597.2599999999998s)]
*  And yeah, right there. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2601.7s)]
*  Yeah, but you're in Park City. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2602.7s)]
*  He's not always blasting shotguns in Park City. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2603.7s)]
*  No, no, they're town turkeys. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2605.98s)]
*  They're very safe. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2607.62s)]
*  They're very comfortable hanging out in the backyard. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2608.62s)]
*  But I thought they were going to die this winter because there was a last winter they [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2609.98s)]
*  were here the whole time because we had a very mild winter last year. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2612.98s)]
*  This year it was not mild. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2616.18s)]
*  It was like the largest recorded snowfall in Utah history or Park City history anyway. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2618.18s)]
*  And so they disappeared. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2623.1s)]
*  And I thought, oh, they're gone because it's the first time they've seen this kind of snow [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2624.1s)]
*  as well. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2626.98s)]
*  But they came back about three weeks ago. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2627.98s)]
*  They came back in force. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2629.54s)]
*  Two hundred of them right back like they never left. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2630.74s)]
*  But did they migrate? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2632.7799999999997s)]
*  I think they found a barn somewhere with some heat and some feed. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2634.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm thinking. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2637.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2638.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2639.98s)]
*  But it has to be because they I don't know if they can just hunker down for all those [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2640.98s)]
*  months that we got all that snow. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2642.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2643.74s)]
*  They don't fly very far. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2644.74s)]
*  No, but they fly. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2645.74s)]
*  It's pretty cool to see them fly for the for the first time when you're not when you think [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2646.74s)]
*  that maybe they don't. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2649.9799999999996s)]
*  And then you see them go up to roost and come down. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2650.9799999999996s)]
*  And that's that's pretty cool. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2654.4599999999996s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2655.4599999999996s)]
*  But yeah, I've how far can they fly? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2656.4599999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2659.9399999999996s)]
*  A hundred yards or something. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2660.9399999999996s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2661.9399999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2662.9399999999996s)]
*  That's all I've seen them flies in these trees. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2663.9399999999996s)]
*  So not very far. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2664.9399999999996s)]
*  But but who knows? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2665.9399999999996s)]
*  Maybe they maybe they do. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2666.9399999999996s)]
*  What a weird bird could kind of fly, but not much. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2667.9399999999996s)]
*  It kind of glides, you know, and they get up there and fly. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2670.5s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2672.8199999999997s)]
*  Find out right now. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2673.8199999999997s)]
*  It says wild turkeys can fly at speeds of up to 40. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2674.8199999999997s)]
*  50 miles an hour, but only for short distances. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2677.58s)]
*  Usually them at their flight distance to about 100 yards or less. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2679.8199999999997s)]
*  Nice. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2682.66s)]
*  I nailed it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2683.66s)]
*  You did that right on. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2684.66s)]
*  It wasn't one hundred and one or ninety nine. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2685.66s)]
*  Like you were on it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2686.66s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2688.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, I've seen them. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2689.3399999999997s)]
*  I've seen them fly. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2690.3399999999997s)]
*  I took a guess. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2691.3399999999997s)]
*  How many how much have some of you spent turkey hunting only once? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2692.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2695.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2696.2599999999998s)]
*  Only once with vanilla. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2697.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2698.2599999999998s)]
*  But my time is very valuable. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2699.3799999999997s)]
*  And if I'm just hunting for one meal, that bothers me. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2702.62s)]
*  I want to hunt where if I shoot like I went with Ronella, we went down to South Texas. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2705.8199999999997s)]
*  I got two whitetail and a Neil guy. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2711.7799999999997s)]
*  So I'm good. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2713.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2714.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2715.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, it's like that's that to me. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2716.8199999999997s)]
*  I like to eat those animals for months. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2718.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2720.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2721.1s)]
*  I've got Neil guy liver and Mike in my refrigerator for breakfast. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2722.1s)]
*  Nice. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2725.9399999999996s)]
*  It's like I like that. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2726.9399999999996s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2728.3799999999997s)]
*  It was good. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2729.3799999999997s)]
*  If you had moose heart, did you guys eat the moose heart when you went? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2730.3799999999997s)]
*  I did. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2731.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2732.8999999999996s)]
*  Good. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2733.8999999999996s)]
*  You slice it real thin and then fry it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2735.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2737.6600000000003s)]
*  Delicious. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2738.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2739.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm a big fan of liver for its performance, like just as a food, as a superfood. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2740.6600000000003s)]
*  It's so good for you. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2745.94s)]
*  Well, then the liver guy. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2746.94s)]
*  What was the liver guy's liver king? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2748.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2749.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2750.9s)]
*  Steroids. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2751.9s)]
*  That was the deal. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2752.9s)]
*  Because I was doing it. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2753.9s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2754.9s)]
*  Just kidding. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2755.9s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2756.9s)]
*  I haven't even working out anymore. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2757.9s)]
*  It's like the workouts, the nutrition and the sleep have fallen to the bottom of the [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2759.5s)]
*  priority list with everything going on. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2763.2999999999997s)]
*  Because of work. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2764.98s)]
*  Because there's books to write and scripts to write. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2765.98s)]
*  Well, not right now, but you reprioritize and focus on book seven. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2767.74s)]
*  And then I have this nonfiction coming out, which has taken a lot more research than I [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2770.58s)]
*  anticipated, which the first one is on the 1983 Bayer Baric's bombing. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2774.2599999999998s)]
*  So it's my first foray into the nonfiction side of the house. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2778.58s)]
*  So working on that right now with an amazing guy, historian Pulitzer Prize finalist James [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2781.9399999999996s)]
*  Scott. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2785.8599999999997s)]
*  And there's really not the seminal work on that event yet. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2786.8599999999997s)]
*  But as a kid, I remember just how impactful that was to me seeing the news week and time [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2789.52s)]
*  and come across our dining room table and seeing those photos and knowing that I was [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2794.84s)]
*  going to go in the military, even at that young age. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2799.36s)]
*  So I was always interested in insurgencies and counterinsurgencies and terrorism and [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2801.36s)]
*  special operations. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2804.6s)]
*  Like I was focused on that from a very early age. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2805.6s)]
*  I'm not aware of that story. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2806.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2808.68s)]
*  So October of 1983, there was two actual car bombs, one with the French paratroopers and [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2809.68s)]
*  one with the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2815.96s)]
*  There were some some lead up events. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2819.72s)]
*  First one in or the first large one that really people noticed the bombing of the American [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2821.72s)]
*  Embassy in Beirut in April 1983. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2826.56s)]
*  And then there's some newly declassified documents from the Reagan administration that talk about [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2829.52s)]
*  what was going on behind the scenes and who was advocating to put Marines ashore, who [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2832.9799999999996s)]
*  wanted to keep them on amphib ships. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2836.72s)]
*  So a little smaller than an aircraft carrier, but take Marines around who wanted to keep [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2839.04s)]
*  them on those ships in a little safer area out on the water in the Med. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2843.68s)]
*  And then who made the decision? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2849.42s)]
*  Well, the president made the final decision. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2851.02s)]
*  I talked to Michael Reagan about it. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2852.5s)]
*  He said that decision haunted his father until the day he died. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2854.02s)]
*  And so they put Marines ashore in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2857.58s)]
*  And then there was a bomb that that took out those barracks. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2860.14s)]
*  And it was the largest Marine loss of life since Iwo Jima in World War Two. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2864.78s)]
*  And so I'm doing this research right now. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2869.02s)]
*  How many people done? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2871.54s)]
*  There were 300 left. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2872.7s)]
*  We can look it up exactly so I don't mess it up by one or two. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2874.8199999999997s)]
*  But it's so impactful and looms over U.S. foreign policy to this day. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2878.8599999999997s)]
*  And there's an ending to it, too. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2884.1s)]
*  307. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2885.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2886.9399999999996s)]
*  241 U.S. military personnel. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2887.9399999999996s)]
*  58 French. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2890.9399999999996s)]
*  58 French, six civilians, two suicide bombers. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2891.9399999999996s)]
*  What is your take on what's going on in Ukraine? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2895.8999999999996s)]
*  Are you up on it? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2898.3399999999997s)]
*  Up on it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2900.22s)]
*  I mean, I'm up on it in... [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2901.22s)]
*  Because I know you're writing about it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2902.22s)]
*  I'm writing about it. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2903.22s)]
*  I wrote about it in the second novel in True Believer. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2904.7s)]
*  And I got that from someone who's also been on this podcast. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2908.62s)]
*  Peter Zihon wrote a book back in 2014. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2910.58s)]
*  And so I used that. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2914.66s)]
*  I read that on my flight to Mozambique where I was doing research for the second novel, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2915.66s)]
*  even though I didn't have a deal for the first novel yet. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2919.06s)]
*  I hadn't even turned that in, but I always knew I was going to write two because John [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2920.8599999999997s)]
*  Grisham, he wrote his first book, A Time to Kill, and couldn't give that book away. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2924.4599999999996s)]
*  And then he writes The Firm. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2927.66s)]
*  And that one takes off. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2928.7799999999997s)]
*  Tom Cruise is in the movie. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2929.7799999999997s)]
*  And they republish A Time to Kill and Matthew McConaughey stars in that one. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2930.82s)]
*  And we've had a John Grisham novel every year. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2934.38s)]
*  So I thought back to that and thought, I'll at least write two. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2936.38s)]
*  And if both of them don't take off, then I'll maybe reevaluate my choices. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2938.94s)]
*  So I knew I was always going to write two. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2942.78s)]
*  But on the flight over there, I read his book Accidental Superpower. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2945.42s)]
*  And that one very clearly predicts a Russian invasion of Ukraine by the year 2022. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2949.38s)]
*  And that was back in 2014. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2956.2200000000003s)]
*  He wrote that. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2957.42s)]
*  So there were signs. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2958.42s)]
*  And was that on the ball? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2959.5s)]
*  To the year. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2960.7000000000003s)]
*  To the exact year. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2961.7000000000003s)]
*  He's a weirdly smart guy. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2962.7000000000003s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2964.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he's been on my podcast and he's been on your podcast. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2965.7000000000003s)]
*  And I've read all his books. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2968.1800000000003s)]
*  He's so sure of what he's saying, too. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2969.38s)]
*  That's what's uncomfortable. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2971.38s)]
*  He's very... [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2972.38s)]
*  You're not even hedging your bets. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2973.38s)]
*  No, no. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2975.58s)]
*  And he's not... [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2976.58s)]
*  He doesn't hedge the bets at all. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2977.58s)]
*  But he also... [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2979.02s)]
*  That's his thing. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2980.3s)]
*  That is 100% his area of expertise and study. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2981.3s)]
*  He lives it. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2984.82s)]
*  He breathes it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2985.82s)]
*  It's not something that he just dabbles in. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2986.82s)]
*  So read that book. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2987.82s)]
*  Amazing, amazing book. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2988.82s)]
*  So I incorporated that into my second novel. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2989.82s)]
*  But now Russia actually did invade Ukraine. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2992.46s)]
*  So now when we work on these scripts for the second season of The Terminalist, well, we [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2994.5800000000004s)]
*  have to figure that out. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2997.6600000000003s)]
*  It's going to change, obviously, because they actually invaded instead of like in the book. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=2998.6600000000003s)]
*  The hero, of course, wins the day. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3002.86s)]
*  But when he talks about that and talks about population decline, very steep population [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3005.9s)]
*  decline in Russia and gives the reasons behind it, and talks about the ethnic Russian population [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3009.54s)]
*  in Ukraine being the largest outside of Russia. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3014.74s)]
*  And he looked at how long you can field an army before you can't field that army anymore. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3017.9s)]
*  And 2022 was that year. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3024.06s)]
*  So in order to field the army at current levels, they had to invade by that time. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3026.5s)]
*  And we really... [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3030.9s)]
*  I mean, this is going back to learning lessons from the past and applying them going forward [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3031.9s)]
*  as wisdom because we really made that invasion inevitable by some of our decisions at the [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3036.86s)]
*  end of the Cold War in the early 90s, all the way through the 90s, and really set things [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3041.3s)]
*  up to make that invasion an inevitability. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3045.42s)]
*  NATO expansion. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3051.02s)]
*  NATO expansion, promises. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3052.02s)]
*  So I like to look at things through the enemy's eyes, which I did in The Devil's Hand, my [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3056.02s)]
*  fourth book. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3058.6800000000003s)]
*  But I think it's important to look at things through the enemy's eyes because it allows [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3059.6800000000003s)]
*  you to then make decisions taking that into account. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3062.34s)]
*  And so with Russia certainly knowing what our response would be to an invasion of Ukraine, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3064.94s)]
*  that's what I incorporated into this one. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3070.86s)]
*  So if you knew what we would do if they invaded Ukraine, what should you do now as Russia [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3072.54s)]
*  to set yourself up? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3078.6200000000003s)]
*  Success is the wrong word, but financially. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3080.78s)]
*  So with gas and oil sales and contracts and futures with India and with China. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3083.34s)]
*  So I work all that into this book. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3089.02s)]
*  So it was quite the education. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3090.7000000000003s)]
*  What did you think about the blowing up of the pipeline? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3092.94s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3095.34s)]
*  There's a... [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3096.34s)]
*  There's a video by Hirsch that has a few articles out there on Substack. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3097.38s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3100.1000000000004s)]
*  People should read those before they just retweet something. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3101.1000000000004s)]
*  But he is, I mean, he is detailed in those accounts of where people are, what military [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3104.2200000000003s)]
*  exercises are going on that would cover a cover fraction, we call it, to allow the US [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3110.5s)]
*  to go in and blow up those pipelines. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3115.38s)]
*  So it's very... [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3117.94s)]
*  And now it's, I think, fairly established that what he writes in there is actually true. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3118.94s)]
*  So it's incredible. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3124.86s)]
*  Well, there's a video of Biden saying that they were going to put a stop to the Nordstream [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3126.1800000000003s)]
*  pipeline. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3129.9s)]
*  And there was an assistant secretary of state, I think she was, saying similar things out [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3130.9s)]
*  there. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3134.78s)]
*  And it's... [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3135.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3136.78s)]
*  So when we go back and look at these things and don't apply any political bias to it and [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3137.78s)]
*  just apply common sense, that's the other thing we don't do. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3140.54s)]
*  And it's... [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3143.1s)]
*  Carl Klausowitz, who wrote On War, said the most important attribute of a battlefield [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3144.1s)]
*  leader is common sense. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3147.34s)]
*  George Marshall, World War II, said the same thing. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3149.06s)]
*  And we neglect to apply common sense to a lot of these things, whether it's as a populist [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3151.86s)]
*  or our elected officials or military leaders. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3155.9s)]
*  So there's a lack of common sense and a stark lack of accountability as well. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3159.46s)]
*  So it's very therapeutic for me to write some of these novels because I get to hold people [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3165.5800000000004s)]
*  accountable in a fictional sense that you couldn't do in real life. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3168.6200000000003s)]
*  Is it a lack of common sense or is it a willingness to ignore consequences because of the financial [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3172.6600000000003s)]
*  interest or the political interest in what you're trying to accomplish? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3180.78s)]
*  That's a huge part of it. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3185.42s)]
*  And we can see a change in 1947. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3186.42s)]
*  So when the defense establishment and the intelligence agencies were all reorganized [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3188.7400000000002s)]
*  in 1947, when we changed the Department of War to the Department of Defense, it became [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3192.86s)]
*  an industry and it stopped being a profession of arms and started becoming a career of arms [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3198.58s)]
*  for senior level officers in particular. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3203.2200000000003s)]
*  And at the same time, we start seeing a lack of accountability because up to that point, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3206.86s)]
*  we can go back to the Civil War and see Lincoln go through general after general until he [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3210.5s)]
*  got to Grant. And same thing in World War II. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3214.34s)]
*  George Marshall went through general after general after general, admiral after admiral [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3216.34s)]
*  after admiral until he got to those names that we all know today who led us to victory [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3219.94s)]
*  in World War II. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3223.6600000000003s)]
*  And then for some reason, and that means that there were people in those positions before [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3224.6600000000003s)]
*  who didn't measure up. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3228.7400000000002s)]
*  So George Marshall would give them a chance and maybe a second one, but not a third. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3229.7400000000002s)]
*  And then they put somebody in place regardless of rank, essentially. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3233.7400000000002s)]
*  He would promote people into the rank they needed to be for those positions if they showed [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3237.26s)]
*  promise. And that's how we got to these leaders that we all know the last names of. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3242.14s)]
*  And we lost that after World War II, particularly in Vietnam. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3246.78s)]
*  Now we start seeing people not held accountable for mistakes. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3249.1s)]
*  We certainly see it with Afghanistan. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3251.7s)]
*  Twenty years they had to prepare for this eventuality. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3253.78s)]
*  Twenty years. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3257.34s)]
*  And then the best they can do is what we saw in August of 2021. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3258.7400000000002s)]
*  And someone who has no touch points with the military, never read a book on military history, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3262.22s)]
*  strategy, tactics, doesn't know anyone in the military, maybe even never seen a military [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3266.58s)]
*  film can apply common sense to that situation and say, look, wait, it looks like Bagram [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3269.48s)]
*  here would be the tactically advantageous position, which it was. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3274.56s)]
*  Why are we putting our junior level enlisted people at this gate at this essentially a [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3278.28s)]
*  public airport in Kabul, putting them in a tactically disadvantageous position to get [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3282.8s)]
*  out of there after we had 20 years to prepare to leave. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3286.96s)]
*  And once again, no one held accountable. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3291.2400000000002s)]
*  And there's a great book. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3293.6s)]
*  It's called the Afghanistan Papers by Craig Whitlock. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3294.6s)]
*  And after two Freedom of Information Act lawsuits by the Washington Post, they got access to [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3297.08s)]
*  these classified histories of the war. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3301.52s)]
*  And so they took these generals and admirals coming back and they interviewed them and [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3304.16s)]
*  they thought these interviews were going to stay classified. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3308.18s)]
*  And so what Craig Whitlock does once he got access to this is he juxtaposes what they [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3310.72s)]
*  said in private that they thought was going to stay classified to what they said in front [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3314.7s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3318.08s)]
*  And they are 180 out from each other. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3319.08s)]
*  And once again, no one held accountable. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3320.92s)]
*  All those guys make rank, they fail up and then sit on boards of defense industry companies [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3322.96s)]
*  going forward. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3327.78s)]
*  And, yeah, we saw that change 1947 onward. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3328.78s)]
*  You cover some of these problems in your books. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3332.92s)]
*  But how frustrating is it for you and how infuriating is it as a man who's a veteran [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3337.6s)]
*  who served, who's been deployed overseas, who's been in these conflicts to see this [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3345.36s)]
*  happening and to see no accountability and to see these poor choices being made over [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3350.3199999999997s)]
*  and over again that put veterans lives at risk, put our lives at risk and put the entire [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3355.3199999999997s)]
*  world in this state right now where we're genuinely concerned about nuclear war, which [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3361.9199999999996s)]
*  we haven't been since the 80s. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3368.2799999999997s)]
*  The fall of the Soviet Union was this great moment in history where we're like, oh, Jesus, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3370.52s)]
*  we're done. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3376.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3377.0s)]
*  Soviet Union is now Russia. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3378.0s)]
*  It's like it's they have elected leaders. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3379.32s)]
*  Everything's going to be great. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3381.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3382.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3383.96s)]
*  I know it's tough because you lose friends over there. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3384.96s)]
*  People lose arms, legs, wheelchairs. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3385.96s)]
*  They sacrifice so much. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3388.32s)]
*  And they're trusting those senior level leaders to make good decisions, politicians and military [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3389.92s)]
*  leaders. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3394.64s)]
*  And then they see what happens over there. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3395.64s)]
*  And so it's very natural to ask that question. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3397.16s)]
*  Was it all worth it? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3398.92s)]
*  What were we doing over there for all these years, for 20 years? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3399.92s)]
*  So it's very natural to ask that question. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3403.7s)]
*  You know, for my own sanity, I just go back to taking those lessons learned and applying [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3405.96s)]
*  them going forward in a way that honors the sacrifice of those who did lose their lives, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3410.2400000000002s)]
*  who didn't come home or who came home changed forever because of post-traumatic stress or [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3414.56s)]
*  traumatic brain injury, missing arms and legs. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3418.0s)]
*  And my hope, my hate to say hope, is that we can take those lessons and apply them to [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3420.0s)]
*  the next generation so they don't have to learn those same lessons in blood. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3425.52s)]
*  But I guess I'm not hopeful because we have shown time and time again that we have a very [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3429.1200000000003s)]
*  difficult time doing that for some reason. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3433.48s)]
*  And I don't know why that is, but it's extremely disheartening. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3435.4s)]
*  And it also sets up that next generation for failure because you have these people coming [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3438.7200000000003s)]
*  up the ranks and they see these generals sit in front of Congress, say certain things. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3443.56s)]
*  You can go back to every single testimony from these guys. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3448.08s)]
*  And they all say pretty much the same thing. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3451.16s)]
*  We're making progress. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3453.64s)]
*  We just need more money. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3454.64s)]
*  We need more time. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3455.64s)]
*  And privately, what were they saying? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3456.64s)]
*  They were saying that this is a disaster. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3458.88s)]
*  And you can go back and look at these. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3461.76s)]
*  And Craig Willock spells it all out. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3463.0s)]
*  He has the transcripts in there. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3464.7200000000003s)]
*  And there's one, and I forget who it is right now, an exact time, but it's around the 2009, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3466.4s)]
*  2010 timeframe where there's one senior level official who's in charge of Afghanistan. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3469.92s)]
*  He doesn't even say anything bad. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3473.88s)]
*  He's just kind of like, you know, it's not going as great as we may have led you to believe. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3474.88s)]
*  And then a few months later, he has quietly moved aside and somebody else has put in. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3479.96s)]
*  So that tells everybody else coming up behind them, that if they want to get this next star [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3483.8s)]
*  and they want to sit on the board of company X, Y, or Z, they better toe this line. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3487.88s)]
*  And it's an industry. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3491.28s)]
*  Is that an issue where the amount of money that's involved in it now because of the military [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3493.28s)]
*  industrial complex is almost it's like you can't turn that back now because you've turned [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3498.8s)]
*  on that spigot. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3504.44s)]
*  The amount of money is continuing to flow. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3506.0s)]
*  These coffers are failing. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3509.6000000000004s)]
*  These people are making so much money to stop it now and to hold people accountable and [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3511.0800000000004s)]
*  to try not like put it into this chain of failure. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3516.12s)]
*  I mean, it's a huge bureaucracy. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3519.12s)]
*  It's a it's a ecosystem that includes politicians. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3521.6s)]
*  It includes military leaders, both in uniform and just out sitting on these boards, lobbyists, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3524.7599999999998s)]
*  permanent Washington. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3529.88s)]
*  It's all a part of this huge infrastructure that is moving forward. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3531.12s)]
*  And just like any company, you got to show profits. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3534.48s)]
*  It's just crazy that, you know, less than 100 years ago, Eisenhower warned us about [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3536.84s)]
*  this at the end of World War Two. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3541.44s)]
*  When he's leaving office, he warned us about it in the 50s and said there is a military [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3543.8s)]
*  industrial complex. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3549.1600000000003s)]
*  And the crazy thing is that speech at that time aired on television and people, you know, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3550.6000000000004s)]
*  remember it. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3557.6000000000004s)]
*  They had a sense of it. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3558.6000000000004s)]
*  But it wasn't until the Internet where you could pull up that speech at any moment you [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3559.6000000000004s)]
*  wanted to on YouTube and just play his words, which is such an incredible resource. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3562.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, we have access to history instantaneously in a way that's never existed before. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3568.7200000000003s)]
*  And we seem to be learning less. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3574.1200000000003s)]
*  I know it's one of those dichotomies that is it's very odd. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3576.48s)]
*  And we all thought when that when you carry the Internet around in your pocket with that [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3579.6000000000004s)]
*  first iPhone. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3582.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3583.76s)]
*  I mean, you thought, oh, we have a discussion and someone says, no, it's this. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3584.76s)]
*  You know, it's this. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3586.7200000000003s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3587.7200000000003s)]
*  We don't have to argue about it. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3588.7200000000003s)]
*  We can look it up right here. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3589.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's going to be great because we can solve all these arguments immediately. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3590.7200000000003s)]
*  And what did it do? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3592.44s)]
*  Well, it just snowballed into this thing where it divides us even further rather than someone [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3593.44s)]
*  saying, oh, look, oh, I was wrong. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3597.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3598.52s)]
*  It says right here. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3599.52s)]
*  No, it just divides us even further. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3600.52s)]
*  And of course, Adventist social media, it's a web. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3602.08s)]
*  It's a tool. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3604.12s)]
*  And any tool can be used for for productive purposes or as a weapon. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3605.12s)]
*  And we have weaponized social media for sure to divide. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3608.2799999999997s)]
*  And who benefits? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3611.08s)]
*  Well, politicians that need to galvanize bases, of course, and the social media companies [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3612.08s)]
*  themselves who have lobbyists in Washington who pay a lot of money to these politicians. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3616.16s)]
*  And it's a whole ecosystem. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3621.2s)]
*  And so being aware of it, I think, is the first step. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3622.6s)]
*  So for our kids, I talk about it with them. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3624.36s)]
*  And I always ask the question, how am I being manipulated here? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3626.6800000000003s)]
*  Which is kind of a cynical way to look at things. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3629.6800000000003s)]
*  But you kind of have to today. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3631.6400000000003s)]
*  And then with the advent of AI, that's a whole another another side of it. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3633.1600000000003s)]
*  Like figuring out what is truth and what is not and what's been made up and what podcast [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3635.56s)]
*  is real and what's not. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3639.6800000000003s)]
*  It's a crazy situation. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3641.84s)]
*  But I want the kids to know that even if they're following somebody on social media, like a [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3642.84s)]
*  person, that's an advertisement for that person and their life. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3645.8s)]
*  And you can see time and time again, beautiful families out there. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3649.0s)]
*  And they're showing here we are in Aruba or whatever. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3652.36s)]
*  And here we are with our Easter photo together. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3654.6s)]
*  And then the next week, there's their divorce and there's abuse and there's all this whole [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3656.8s)]
*  thing was all a farce. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3660.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3661.96s)]
*  So that's an advertisement just like a company. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3662.96s)]
*  When I see someone doing something like that, I always assume that you're trying to like [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3665.38s)]
*  you're trying to sell me something. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3669.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3670.88s)]
*  Come on, why are you trying to sell me your relationship so good? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3671.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3674.2000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3675.2000000000003s)]
*  How am I being manipulated right here? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3676.2000000000003s)]
*  It's one thing. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3677.2000000000003s)]
*  It's Mother's Day. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3678.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, she's such a great mom. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3679.2000000000003s)]
*  OK, OK. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3680.2000000000003s)]
*  How many days a week you doing that? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3681.3999999999996s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3682.8799999999997s)]
*  You have the perfect family, you have the perfect life, you have the perfect this. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3683.8799999999997s)]
*  So you're trying to sell it to people instead of just living it. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3686.9599999999996s)]
*  And it's a very weird thing that we're doing that never existed before. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3690.7599999999998s)]
*  So there's no real roadmap of how to navigate it correctly. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3694.7999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3698.4399999999996s)]
*  It's kind of like when you have a psychologist or a psychiatrist on and they're really getting [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3699.4399999999996s)]
*  into your life maybe or they're out there giving advice, giving all this advice. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3704.04s)]
*  And then you find out that in the background there, they're a total disaster. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3707.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3710.0s)]
*  That happens more often than not. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3711.76s)]
*  Not sorry to psychologists and psychologists out there, but you know it's true. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3713.44s)]
*  Oh, it's very true. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3716.48s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of doctors out there that are extremely unhealthy. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3717.48s)]
*  So there's a lot of weird stuff going on in this world where there's people that are experts [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3720.2s)]
*  and giving advice. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3723.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3724.96s)]
*  I know, it's tough. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3725.96s)]
*  I think about that a lot when I talk. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3726.96s)]
*  I'm like, man, better not be full of shit. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3728.24s)]
*  I know, it's tough. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3730.52s)]
*  How are you supposed to check all this? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3731.52s)]
*  It's a full time job checking on this stuff and it's wild. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3732.92s)]
*  And for the kids, it's the toughest. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3735.92s)]
*  Like our daughter just missed it. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3737.08s)]
*  She's 17, so she got a little bit of it. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3738.56s)]
*  She grew up on the internet. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3740.48s)]
*  She grew up on the internet, but she didn't grow up with the amount of input that these [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3741.48s)]
*  kids are getting now at age 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3745.48s)]
*  The TikTok era. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3748.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3749.04s)]
*  She just missed that. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3750.04s)]
*  So our little guy who is 12 is hitting that side. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3751.04s)]
*  And they're pretty sly. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3754.12s)]
*  Our little guy out there, he's a smart one. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3755.72s)]
*  So he can figure out ways around the blocks and all these other sorts of things. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3758.12s)]
*  So it's an interesting time for parents, tough time I think for parents and tough time for [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3762.32s)]
*  kids. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3765.56s)]
*  I think it's for kids. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3766.56s)]
*  I think it's always been a tough time for parents and always been a tough time for kids. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3767.96s)]
*  And these are just unique challenges that exist, but every era has unique challenges. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3771.56s)]
*  What I'm worried about is this stuff that we're talking about in terms of accountability [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3777.84s)]
*  with the military industrial complex. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3783.08s)]
*  I don't know how that turns around. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3785.8s)]
*  Other than some catastrophic disaster. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3789.6400000000003s)]
*  And the catastrophic disasters that we're talking about are nuclear. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3793.0s)]
*  If there's a nuclear disaster, it's that Einstein quote, I don't know what weapons World War [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3796.4s)]
*  III will be fought with, but World War IV will be fought with rocks and sticks. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3801.52s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3805.52s)]
*  I don't know, I've never heard that quote before. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3806.52s)]
*  I might have paraphrased it, I'm sure I did. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3808.76s)]
*  But it's basically what he said. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3810.8s)]
*  And that's what scares the shit out of me is that you got a guy like Putin who may or [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3812.76s)]
*  may not have cancer, who's backed into a corner. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3817.6800000000003s)]
*  What does he do if he thinks he's going to lose and he thinks he's going to die? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3821.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3825.84s)]
*  So the only thing I think about in that point is who benefits if you use even tactical nuclear [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3826.84s)]
*  weapons in a place like Ukraine? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3831.6800000000003s)]
*  That's the area that they want. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3833.1600000000003s)]
*  So it doesn't, when you look at it logically, maybe they can move some things around on [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3834.84s)]
*  a board and move nuclear weapons closer or farther away or that sort of a thing is kind [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3838.6400000000003s)]
*  of pieces on a chessboard. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3842.96s)]
*  But if you want to invade a country because you want its population and because you want [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3844.7200000000003s)]
*  its food sources, then to nuke it doesn't really play in. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3848.44s)]
*  Unless they think they're going to lose Russia. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3853.64s)]
*  And that's that's what the population decline. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3856.3199999999997s)]
*  There are essentially a few, according to Peter Zion, is there a few generations away [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3857.96s)]
*  from the same thing with China with the one trial policy. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3862.68s)]
*  So they have a similar situation there. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3865.04s)]
*  Japan has a giant population collapse issue as well. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3866.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3869.68s)]
*  So it's tough. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3870.68s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3871.48s)]
*  It's there's so many. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3872.48s)]
*  I mean, who the fuck would want to be president? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3873.68s)]
*  Seriously, that's the whole thing. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3876.56s)]
*  A politician in general. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3878.36s)]
*  Who's drawn to that? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3880.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure there are people that are drawn to it for pure reasons and want to serve. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3881.76s)]
*  And they made they started businesses and made money and would give back. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3885.4s)]
*  And they're concerned about the future of the country. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3888.28s)]
*  I'm sure they exist. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3890.2000000000003s)]
*  But, man, people get into those positions and they sure do pick stocks a lot better than [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3891.0s)]
*  they did before. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3894.7200000000003s)]
*  Across the board. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3897.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's not just Nancy Pelosi. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3898.56s)]
*  No, it's a little thing. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3900.4s)]
*  It's part of that established part of that permanent Washington. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3901.88s)]
*  It's part of the ecosystem. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3904.04s)]
*  And it's it's how it is. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3905.6s)]
*  That's the motivation. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3907.2400000000002s)]
*  And the access to information that allows you to pick stocks so good. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3908.36s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3912.04s)]
*  And in my first book, I talk about, hey, you show me a politician in Washington and I'm [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3913.0800000000004s)]
*  going to show you a family member who has some sort of a lobbying firm or this or that. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3916.32s)]
*  And then what are we seeing with the Biden administration? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3920.7200000000003s)]
*  You're seeing some of that right now on the front pages. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3923.28s)]
*  They are just holding on to that as long as they can, because it seems like that is a [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3925.8s)]
*  crazy mountain of corruption. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3931.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't think it's I don't think it is only them. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3934.1200000000003s)]
*  I want you to imagine if that was Trump. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3936.68s)]
*  Imagine if Donald Trump Jr. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3939.56s)]
*  was Hunter Biden. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3941.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Smoking street crack with Vietnamese hookers and and just and all of it documented. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3942.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not like rumors like the Steele dossier where they're like Trump likes to get peed [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3949.92s)]
*  on. No, like this guy's getting foot jobs and putting it on his laptop and then dropping [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3954.3599999999997s)]
*  it off in Maryland. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3959.48s)]
*  But I'm skeptical about everything. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3960.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, skeptical about the laptop story. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3962.2s)]
*  I mean, it's it's sort of it's burned into our brains. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3964.44s)]
*  Like, that's what happened. But I think like 10 years from now, we'll probably find out [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3968.6800000000003s)]
*  that that's horseshit, too. I mean, who fucking knows? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3973.28s)]
*  I don't know. I've never stole his laptop. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3975.2400000000002s)]
*  So I know a couple of people that saw it right off the bat. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3978.76s)]
*  And and what it has been kept to in the news, from my understanding, is the professional [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3980.92s)]
*  side. So the people who saw it are people who didn't have a vested interest in showing [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3985.8s)]
*  any of that personal stuff, which some of is out there. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3990.28s)]
*  But and this is secondhand information. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3992.48s)]
*  But there's stuff out there that is personally a lot more, I guess, damaging, you would say. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=3996.88s)]
*  That's horrible. But what they tried to stay to, for the most part, is the ties to the [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4002.08s)]
*  corruption. Exactly. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4006.76s)]
*  The corruption is undeniable. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4007.96s)]
*  I mean, just the the fact that he's just completely unqualified to be in those positions [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4009.52s)]
*  that he's at, making the kind of money that he was making and doing it for Russia and [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4016.0s)]
*  China. It's just it's so and Ukraine. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4020.56s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I mean, what's crazy is that Ukraine was thought to be one of the most [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4023.48s)]
*  corrupt countries up until Russia invaded them. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4029.48s)]
*  And now they're the darling. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4033.0s)]
*  Sean Penn's given his Oscar to Zelensky and we are so fucking lost. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4034.56s)]
*  That's what goes back to doing the research. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4040.48s)]
*  And really, before you take that step, going back and making sure you're taking the right [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4042.0s)]
*  one. But for the American people, it's almost like there's too much research. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4046.08s)]
*  To do. You don't have the time for the average person that wants to. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4050.92s)]
*  If you have a conservative position or or a liberal position, it's like, boy, you have [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4054.7999999999997s)]
*  to trust in these fucking jackasses that are running the country to be steering you [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4060.56s)]
*  correctly. And they never are. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4064.84s)]
*  They never are. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4067.16s)]
*  It's so tough. They lie about anything that's going to damage their party. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4068.7999999999997s)]
*  They lie about anything that's going to damage their positions or anything that's going to [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4072.84s)]
*  contradict what they've said in the past. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4077.24s)]
*  It's crazy. It's great. And I talk about it in most of the books. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4080.4s)]
*  I weave it. I weave it in there. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4083.68s)]
*  That's it. So it's not I don't think it is just reserved for one party, but we're [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4085.4s)]
*  divided along these lines. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4089.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But who does it benefit? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4091.24s)]
*  Certainly not the citizenry. Certainly not us. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4092.64s)]
*  Doesn't benefit us to say just side with your side because it's your side without even [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4095.08s)]
*  thinking. And that's the kind of that's the position we're in right now, unfortunately. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4099.68s)]
*  But benefits the people who make the most money, which is so terrifying. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4103.16s)]
*  And then you see these politicians that just they they benefit from benefiting those [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4106.2s)]
*  people that make the most money. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4111.36s)]
*  It's an ecosystem. It's so huge right now. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4113.5199999999995s)]
*  And then you lose you undercut confidence in voting systems. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4116.68s)]
*  So there's that's in there now. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4120.32s)]
*  And then you have, let's say, going back to 100 Biden laptop, you have 50, what, 51, 52 [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4122.96s)]
*  intelligence officials who signed some letter that's now shown that it's that they were [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4127.5199999999995s)]
*  coerced into not coerced into signing this thing, but they they they signed it for a [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4132.2s)]
*  reason to give their candidate, the establishment candidate, a talking point in [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4136.16s)]
*  a debate. And that undercuts everyone's confidence in those institutions anyway. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4141.96s)]
*  And it was always a little shaky, your confidence in an intelligence service just in [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4146.2s)]
*  general. Yes. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4150.24s)]
*  Well, particularly after the Trump administration attacked them for four years. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4151.4s)]
*  The Trump administration attacked the intelligence community. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4155.8s)]
*  And then what does the intelligence community do? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4158.24s)]
*  They come out and lie about the 100 Biden laptop. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4159.72s)]
*  Like, hey, guys. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4162.48s)]
*  And that just undermines all of our confidence in these institutions. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4164.12s)]
*  Yeah. And FBI. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4166.5599999999995s)]
*  Same thing. Huge, huge issues there. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4168.0s)]
*  And then it goes down to the local level and local level politics as well. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4170.2s)]
*  Police departments and mayors and all the rest of it. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4175.08s)]
*  So it's, you know, it's endemic throughout the whole system, unfortunately. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4177.44s)]
*  How does that ever get corrected? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4181.48s)]
*  I mean, I don't want I mean, when I have conversations with my kids about politics and [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4183.28s)]
*  life and stuff, it's like, you know, my young kids, I'm not my my oldest is 26. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4187.16s)]
*  I don't like my when I'm talking to my 12, well, now 13 and 14 year olds [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4192.5599999999995s)]
*  and 15 year olds. When I'm talking to them like they're at this point where they're [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4198.12s)]
*  going to be graduating from high school in a few years. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4202.12s)]
*  They're going to be going to college, going to be entering to the workforce and doing [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4204.68s)]
*  stuff. What what do you tell them about this insanely corrupt system? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4207.72s)]
*  That's supposed to be the the controlling operating system of this [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4213.88s)]
*  greatest country the world has ever known. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4219.68s)]
*  This experiment in self-government. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4222.16s)]
*  It's just deeply corrupt. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4223.92s)]
*  It is. And so what we do is we go back and talk about all those sacrifices that were [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4226.08s)]
*  made so we can have these options and opportunities in the hopes that that our kids [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4231.24s)]
*  take a pause and become part of the solution and respect what has happened in the past [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4235.36s)]
*  so that we can be this country we are today, even though it seems to be we seem to be [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4240.08s)]
*  pretty good at destroying ourselves from the inside out right now. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4244.0s)]
*  We did have a civil war. And at the end of that civil war, we did manage to come back [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4246.92s)]
*  together. So that gives me hope right there. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4251.4s)]
*  Took a long ass time. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4253.599999999999s)]
*  It took some time. There are people that didn't want it to happen murder in the Appalachians. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4254.92s)]
*  And we didn't have social media. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4258.24s)]
*  Yeah, we didn't have this tool that you could use to continue to divide. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4260.36s)]
*  I wonder after the civil war, if we had iPhones in our pockets and two sides or even [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4264.04s)]
*  some other factions that wanted to continue to divide and prolong or whatever it was, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4269.84s)]
*  would we still have come back together? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4274.92s)]
*  I think social media is a problem. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4276.72s)]
*  But at least social media has this at least with Elon on board. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4278.4800000000005s)]
*  Elon being in control of Twitter has this self-correcting option that's built in with [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4284.360000000001s)]
*  community notes where, say, if you are a politician and you tweet something and a bunch [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4289.52s)]
*  of people say that is not correct at all, Twitter will put a community note on and show [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4295.64s)]
*  all the real facts. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4300.8s)]
*  And the Biden administration has deleted tweets because they've been checked. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4302.639999999999s)]
*  I haven't seen it yet. So you've seen it out there. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4307.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I tried to follow politicians. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4308.5599999999995s)]
*  The Biden administration has, they have deleted at least one that I'm aware of. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4309.84s)]
*  I think it's more than one. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4313.96s)]
*  Really? Yeah. It's like that's the good thing about social media as it exists. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4315.0s)]
*  But that's why, you know, all these people that are mad that Elon took over, oh, you're [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4320.36s)]
*  letting in these jackasses that were banned in the past. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4324.96s)]
*  It's like the only answer to bad speech is better speech. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4327.64s)]
*  The only answer to bad information is correct information. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4334.280000000001s)]
*  And if you ban that information, then they just find some echo chamber and spit it out [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4337.68s)]
*  amongst each other. And that's how you get QAnon. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4343.68s)]
*  That's how you get flat earthers. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4346.0s)]
*  That's how you get all these fucking loons out there. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4347.88s)]
*  So if you want to maintain hope for the nation, don't go into the comments section of [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4351.280000000001s)]
*  Instagram, Twitter or YouTube, because very quickly you will come to the conclusion that [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4354.72s)]
*  all is lost. I don't know about Twitter anymore. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4359.280000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't read anything about myself. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4362.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's it's given me great sanity. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4365.0s)]
*  Yeah. The last few years. It's a giant. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4367.320000000001s)]
*  It's a giant factor. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4370.04s)]
*  And I try to drill it into all these comedians heads. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4371.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like, please don't read the comments. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4374.360000000001s)]
*  Just don't do it. Because, first of all, you're with it, especially if they do a podcast. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4376.68s)]
*  If you're doing this like I had my friends, Sarah Wineshank and Kim Kongdon on. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4382.12s)]
*  And after the podcast was over, I was like, please don't read the comments. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4387.88s)]
*  Please. We had a great time. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4390.92s)]
*  It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4392.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it was really funny. Yeah. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4394.08s)]
*  Don't read the comments. But these girls are. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4395.4s)]
*  Of course they do. They're used to small podcasts that might get a thousand downloads [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4397.599999999999s)]
*  or a couple thousand downloads. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4405.24s)]
*  Now you got 11 million people that are commenting on every fucking thing you've said. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4406.44s)]
*  And the only thing you're going to think of is the negatives. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4411.32s)]
*  And these girls suck. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4414.16s)]
*  And they're fucking losers and not funny. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4415.16s)]
*  They're this or that. Like those are just unhappy, bitter people. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4416.48s)]
*  You know, who's it was it Michael Jordan said? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4420.92s)]
*  I don't remember who said it. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4422.5199999999995s)]
*  I've never met a hater doing better than me. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4423.8s)]
*  Right. I remember. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4425.32s)]
*  But it's the perfect the perfect quote. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4426.24s)]
*  Yeah. You've got people that are allowed to have their opinions. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4428.5599999999995s)]
*  They're allowed to be angry. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4431.96s)]
*  They're allowed to be bitter. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4433.48s)]
*  They're allowed to say you suck. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4434.48s)]
*  They're allowed to say you're a liar. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4435.76s)]
*  They're allowed to say you're stupid. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4437.12s)]
*  Let them talk. It's OK. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4438.68s)]
*  Let them talk. But just don't read it. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4441.16s)]
*  It's even if you have thick skin, it still gets in there. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4443.28s)]
*  It gets in there. It gets in there. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4446.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, that's why I don't read it. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4447.96s)]
*  I don't. I don't not read it because [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4449.36s)]
*  it's not like I'm immune. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4453.88s)]
*  Right. I read it because like it's natural human nature to look for threats. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4455.28s)]
*  And if you read a hundred quotes that are great and then one that sucks [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4460.44s)]
*  and that one person says this person should kill themselves and they're [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4464.68s)]
*  you know, they're this and that and that and this. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4468.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. Am I that person? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4471.12s)]
*  And you can't engage. You can't go back. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4472.72s)]
*  And it just, you know, I see people that do. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4474.24s)]
*  And I'm like, Jesus Christ, you're just you're just throwing gasoline on it. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4476.6s)]
*  Exactly. Get the fuck out of there. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4479.6s)]
*  How long did you look at comments before? [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4481.08s)]
*  When did you stop? Years. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4482.68s)]
*  For years, I looked at comments. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4483.84s)]
*  Yeah. And it would make me feel bad. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4485.16s)]
*  I didn't like it. I didn't like I didn't like getting mad. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4486.88s)]
*  And like, like, that's not true. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4489.56s)]
*  Fuck them. I'm going to fucking come back. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4490.96s)]
*  I'm going to look at your Instagram. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4494.4400000000005s)]
*  Look at you, you fucking fat loser. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4495.4400000000005s)]
*  But that's that's just the way I try to [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4497.28s)]
*  explain to people is look at your mind and your attention like it is bandwidth. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4500.56s)]
*  And let's let's assume that you have units. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4507.240000000001s)]
*  You have 100 units of bandwidth. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4509.96s)]
*  If you spend 13 units of bandwidth paying attention to social media, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4512.0s)]
*  critics and comments, that's 13 less. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4516.280000000001s)]
*  Now you only have 87 units. Right. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4519.200000000001s)]
*  So to to I I. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4521.4400000000005s)]
*  Sam Harris told me once that he was on a trip in Hawaii with his family. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4524.4800000000005s)]
*  And he read something negative about him. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4530.72s)]
*  And it tanked his whole trip because he spent his entire time crafting a response. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4533.0s)]
*  I'm like, God damn. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4538.4800000000005s)]
*  No. And he's brilliant. Yeah. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4540.080000000001s)]
*  He's a very smart man. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4541.6s)]
*  So for him to fall into that trap. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4543.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And we're all human. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4545.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And no matter if you're a special operator, people think you have this thick skin. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4547.04s)]
*  Yeah. If you went to Iraq and Afghanistan and made through buds or all that stuff. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4550.56s)]
*  For me, anyway, you know, it definitely hurts. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4553.72s)]
*  But I try to get on there still and say thank you to people because I'm not quite [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4556.240000000001s)]
*  I can still do it at the end of the night. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4559.28s)]
*  That's not it. But I want to say thank you. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4560.5599999999995s)]
*  But it also means I see the craziness. Yeah. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4562.4s)]
*  And so I see that I never respond to it. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4564.44s)]
*  But I want to say thank you to all those people who grassroots like before I [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4566.28s)]
*  for you to invite me on here before I before Chris Pratt [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4569.8s)]
*  texted about the show or posted about the show before I was on Tucker. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4572.759999999999s)]
*  It was all grassroots. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4576.04s)]
*  It was all somebody taking a risk on me as a new author, telling a friend. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4577.24s)]
*  And so people get on and say, hey, I love your book. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4580.5199999999995s)]
*  I gave it to my dad. Now he's a fan. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4582.4s)]
*  I want to say thank you to that person. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4583.96s)]
*  So I'm up late doing that. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4585.08s)]
*  But it also means that I see. Yeah. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4586.28s)]
*  That's there's there comes a point in time where you just have to post things [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4588.4s)]
*  and then say thank you in the post. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4592.28s)]
*  But you can't respond to people individually just because it's just bad for your brain. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4594.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not healthy. No. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4598.679999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, you're saying with special operators, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4599.839999999999s)]
*  but I see it with fighters. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4602.599999999999s)]
*  I try to tell fighters all the time. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4603.719999999999s)]
*  Don't read that shit. Yeah. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4605.36s)]
*  Is this is some guys love it. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4607.0s)]
*  Really? David Goggins fucking loves it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4609.24s)]
*  Does he get in there after people? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4611.44s)]
*  He reads all the comments out to he reads haters to himself [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4612.32s)]
*  and he plays it when he runs. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4616.4s)]
*  Oh, wow. He's a different kind of psycho. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4618.04s)]
*  Wow. That's interesting. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4620.76s)]
*  Is that cheating? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4622.8s)]
*  Then if he's a word, he can't listen to music, then that's cheating. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4623.4s)]
*  He just needs to listen. Oh, yeah. That's right. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4625.72s)]
*  That guy has no knees and he runs a thousand miles a day. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4627.88s)]
*  I mean, whatever the fuck he has to do to do what he does. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4631.32s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4634.04s)]
*  So I do. I haven't done it in a while, but I used to read [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4634.96s)]
*  going to the negative reviews on Amazon and and then read those [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4637.16s)]
*  and kind of have a little fun with them. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4639.92s)]
*  And when I went on Tucker, I read the negative reviews from the show. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4640.96s)]
*  And that was fun because the Daily Beast was. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4643.56s)]
*  Oh, they were just mean. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4645.16s)]
*  There were some mean ones out there. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4646.0s)]
*  Like the audience on Rotten Tomatoes was crazy high for a show. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4647.08s)]
*  I mean, it was in the high 90s. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4650.24s)]
*  Yeah. And then but then the critics didn't were big fans. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4651.4s)]
*  But every single day we realized and we're making that show [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4655.76s)]
*  that we're not making it for critics. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4658.12s)]
*  We're making it for that person who went down range [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4659.28s)]
*  to Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 20 years. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4661.0s)]
*  So when they sit down and crack a beer and sit on the couch [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4662.96s)]
*  and turn this thing on, that they at least know we put in the effort [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4665.6s)]
*  to make a show for them that paid tribute to them, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4667.96s)]
*  that was rooted in the realities of modern combat. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4670.44s)]
*  And we put in the work. You fucking nailed it. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4672.64s)]
*  No, no doubt. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4674.88s)]
*  And you nailed it on the show. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4676.12s)]
*  They made that show so fucking gritty. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4678.28s)]
*  And whenever someone makes an adaptation of a very brutal novel [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4681.599999999999s)]
*  or multiple novels like yours, you always wonder like, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4685.44s)]
*  God, are they going to be able to really do? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4689.4s)]
*  And they did. They fucking did. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4690.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a tribute to Chris Pratt and Antoine Fuqua, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4693.04s)]
*  who were from the get go. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4695.599999999999s)]
*  They wanted this thing. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4696.64s)]
*  They wanted to make it for the people who went down range. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4697.4s)]
*  Yes. And every single day we talked about that, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4699.44s)]
*  knowing that there's going to be like there's going to be Hollywood [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4701.44s)]
*  hot sauce in anything. You got to do that. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4703.36s)]
*  But anywhere we could, anywhere we could root this [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4705.639999999999s)]
*  in the realities of modern combat, we were going to do that. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4707.919999999999s)]
*  If we had to reshoot something or change something in the script [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4710.08s)]
*  on the fly, we were going to do that. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4712.48s)]
*  And that's that's Chris and Antoine and the showrunner, David DiGilio [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4714.24s)]
*  and Max Adams, former Army Ranger, who's in that writer's room every day. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4716.759999999999s)]
*  And Jared Shaw, my buddy who is there every day, who gave the book to Chris Pratt [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4720.0s)]
*  and Raymond Doza, another SEAL buddy out there doing the technical advising. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4724.4s)]
*  I mean, they were all in and you had Chris and Antoine and David DiGilio [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4727.759999999999s)]
*  trusting those guys on set every day. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4731.28s)]
*  So if one of them said, this is not going to play to that person [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4733.48s)]
*  who went to Iraq and Afghanistan, we'd change it right there. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4736.12s)]
*  That's pretty cool. That is very cool. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4738.759999999999s)]
*  And, you know, at the end of the day, those people that were critics, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4740.96s)]
*  they were never going to like it. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4743.5599999999995s)]
*  They don't like that subject matter. It's not you really you really [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4744.599999999999s)]
*  there's room for criticism. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4749.28s)]
*  And the criticism should be reserved for people that actually understand [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4751.12s)]
*  what they're talking about. And [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4754.4s)]
*  you look something like the Daily Beast that exists. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4756.96s)]
*  It's OK. That's cool, too. That's fine. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4758.96s)]
*  It's cool to shit on. Yeah. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4760.879999999999s)]
*  And it was fun to read it and have a good time with it on on Tucker. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4762.04s)]
*  I got so many people reaching out to me saying they love that. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4764.96s)]
*  And we just had a little fun on a Friday reading those things and, you know, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4767.56s)]
*  just reading their own words back to them and having a little fun with it. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4770.36s)]
*  So that's kind of a healthy way to deal with it rather than [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4773.08s)]
*  then looking at it and just kind of craft that response or like getting mad about it. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4775.8s)]
*  Like they're going to hate it anyway. And that's OK. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4779.48s)]
*  It's not their thing. There's plenty of other things out there that they can love. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4782.28s)]
*  And that's that's OK. We're going to make something something for us here. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4784.92s)]
*  And then that's what we're doing. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4787.72s)]
*  We're taking that guiding principle because I don't think Amazon will ever [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4788.84s)]
*  none of those streaming streaming companies will ever share their data. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4791.56s)]
*  But they know exactly how many people watched every single show. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4795.52s)]
*  When they changed the channel, when they got to an end of episode [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4798.68s)]
*  and didn't go to the next one, they have all that data. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4801.400000000001s)]
*  And that's the reason that we're doing a spinoff and a second season [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4803.68s)]
*  is because we know. So spinoff is there's a character, Ben Edwards. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4807.8s)]
*  And so spoiler alert for those who have not seen it. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4811.320000000001s)]
*  We'll just give you two seconds to to put the earmuffs on. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4814.080000000001s)]
*  So he's killed at the end. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4817.68s)]
*  And so it's a prequel that goes back to show how he went from [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4818.92s)]
*  the SEAL teams to the CIA, essentially how he turns bad. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4823.0s)]
*  It's played by Taylor Kitsch, who was just awesome. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4825.56s)]
*  And that's one of the characters I thought was more fully developed [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4827.84s)]
*  than the character in my novel and on the page. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4829.84s)]
*  And then what Taylor Kitsch brought to it was just next level. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4832.8s)]
*  So when we did the premiere in L.A. in June and it debuted on July 1st, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4835.52s)]
*  but we did the premiere in June, I came home and for some reason [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4841.4400000000005s)]
*  I had a day without interruption. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4844.12s)]
*  I don't know where my wife and kids were, but I was sitting in a chair [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4846.0s)]
*  that I would never sit in if I didn't want to be interrupted. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4848.32s)]
*  And I wrote from the second I woke up all the way through the night [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4850.5199999999995s)]
*  until until they got back. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4854.44s)]
*  And I wrote a spinoff and and I sent it to the showrunner David DiGilio. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4855.92s)]
*  And he loved it. And then a couple of days later, Chris Pratt called. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4860.2s)]
*  And he's like, hey, I have this idea for a spinoff. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4862.5599999999995s)]
*  And he pitched me on it. And it wasn't mine. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4864.36s)]
*  It was not my spinoff. Mine was totally different. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4866.12s)]
*  And his was this Taylor Kitsch spitch off of a spinoff, a prequel [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4868.12s)]
*  going back in time a little bit. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4871.44s)]
*  And I said, Chris, that's amazing. Let's do that. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4873.0s)]
*  That's a great idea. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4875.32s)]
*  And so he pitched it to Taylor. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4876.44s)]
*  Taylor was all on board. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4878.04s)]
*  And then we put a package together and pitched it to Amazon. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4879.12s)]
*  And they loved it. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4881.2s)]
*  And so we go to the races with this spinoff, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4881.8s)]
*  which is more of an international espionage type of a show [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4884.2s)]
*  rather than revenge thriller, action thriller, conspiracy thriller [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4886.72s)]
*  like the first one. And it is awesome. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4889.92s)]
*  And also nobody can compare it to a book. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4891.88s)]
*  So even fans of the book that look at it and say, this is different. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4893.44s)]
*  This is different. This is different. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4896.04s)]
*  I hate it because there's no prequel. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4897.2s)]
*  And then that leads right into the second season. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4898.92s)]
*  True Believers starring Chris Pratt. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4901.24s)]
*  And so we'll roll right into that. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4902.6s)]
*  And things in Hollywood, as you know, can go off the rails at any time. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4904.44s)]
*  So I always have, you know, that's just how it goes. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4906.68s)]
*  But right now we're working on those scripts or well, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4908.84s)]
*  we put the pencils down about five days ago now, six days ago, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4910.64s)]
*  seven days ago for the writer's strike. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4913.280000000001s)]
*  But we were about episode five and it's good. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4914.92s)]
*  Oh, man, it's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4918.360000000001s)]
*  And so when was that supposed to go into production? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4920.56s)]
*  We're supposed to do it sometime in the in the fall and early fall [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4923.08s)]
*  and start filming then and then post production. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4926.76s)]
*  And, you know, who knows when they get it out after that. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4928.72s)]
*  But you know, they may have they made progress with the strike or they? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4930.84s)]
*  I don't know. I think they're picketing right now. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4935.28s)]
*  So I think it's the early stages still. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4936.92s)]
*  And there's so much to negotiate. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4938.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't I don't know. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4939.92s)]
*  But I would think it might take a little bit with this one. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4941.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4944.2s)]
*  When someone crosses the writer's strike, that's that's some dirty shit. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4945.0s)]
*  Yeah. Across the picket line. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4948.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen anybody doing that. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4950.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think Ellen did. Oh, really? Yeah. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4952.24s)]
*  Oh, I had a buddy of mine who was writing on Ellen. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4954.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, back in the day. Oh, well, that's tough because then I'll be going forward. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4956.96s)]
*  Everybody's like, hey, you're the one that didn't stand up. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4961.679999999999s)]
*  Well, also, oh, yeah, but it kind of knows now. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4963.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. What she's really all about. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4967.32s)]
*  And that's another one of those like, I'm so nice and I'm so sweet. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4969.36s)]
*  And interesting. Yeah, very interesting. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4973.08s)]
*  So that's the mean behind the scenes. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4975.52s)]
*  That's tough. That's weird when that happens. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4977.6s)]
*  Like, it's a lot because people ask me about you. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4979.2s)]
*  People ask me and people give me things that, as you know, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4981.4400000000005s)]
*  people probably send you things all the time. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4984.4800000000005s)]
*  People send me stuff. Can you get this to Chris? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4985.84s)]
*  Can you get this to Joe? Can you get this to Tucker type things? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4987.28s)]
*  And you're like, yeah. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4989.4s)]
*  But it's so that part is is kind of strange. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4991.16s)]
*  But people always ask, you know, what those people are like, you know? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4993.96s)]
*  And, you know, you are you. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4996.72s)]
*  You know, how could you fake this five days a week? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=4998.6s)]
*  You can't. There's no way you can fake a talk show, though. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5001.64s)]
*  I guess because you're an hour because you have an hour. Right. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5004.12s)]
*  Oh, not only that, you don't know the people. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5006.08s)]
*  You're not having these uncensored conversations for hours. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5008.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's very edited. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5011.24s)]
*  And it's also like there's an audience there. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5012.360000000001s)]
*  So you're playing to the audience. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5014.16s)]
*  You're well aware. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5016.08s)]
*  And there's stuff that's filmed, stuff that's not filmed. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5017.28s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's Chris is the same thing, man. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5019.84s)]
*  Chris is so, you know, me and my wife are having a conversation about like actors, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5022.28s)]
*  you know, and she was talking about someone that was very annoying. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5027.4s)]
*  But and I said, yeah, I go. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5029.92s)]
*  It's rare, but it makes you cherish the ones that are cool, like Scott Eastwood. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5032.44s)]
*  Scott Eastwood, if you didn't know that he was Clint Eastwood's son, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5038.0s)]
*  if you didn't know he's a big movie star, he's like the fucking nicest, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5042.88s)]
*  most normal, no ego having guy, just friendly. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5047.12s)]
*  Normal. You talk to him. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5052.08s)]
*  He's not needy. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5053.8s)]
*  He's just like, yeah, right there. He's a great guy. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5055.4800000000005s)]
*  Then unless you put two pictures of him and his dad, like from the 70s. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5058.0s)]
*  Right now, then that's that's amazing resemblance. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5060.76s)]
*  He seems like an awesome guy. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5062.68s)]
*  Strong gene. That is. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5064.68s)]
*  Yeah, those are good ones right there. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5066.240000000001s)]
*  Those outlaw Josie Wales genes. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5067.8s)]
*  They were right in the picture. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5069.4800000000005s)]
*  That's the picture. Great fucking genes. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5070.76s)]
*  Not bad. You know, if you had to choose. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5072.64s)]
*  Good looking guy. Not bad. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5074.0s)]
*  But yeah, Chris and Chris, so nice. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5075.56s)]
*  They're the nicest guy. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5077.4800000000005s)]
*  I ran into Chris once [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5078.48s)]
*  accidentally just randomly in Hawaii with my family. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5079.879999999999s)]
*  He was on I believe he was on his honeymoon. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5083.32s)]
*  Yeah. At that four seasons out there. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5085.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5087.679999999999s)]
*  We were setting that setting some stuff up for him. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5089.4s)]
*  We're going to get him a little house there. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5091.32s)]
*  They decided to go with the and the actual hotel. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5092.719999999999s)]
*  But and we'd spend some time together in Utah. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5095.2s)]
*  Me, you and Chris out there. Yeah. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5097.44s)]
*  And that was the first time that I got to sit there. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5099.04s)]
*  So he'd optioned it in before the book came out. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5100.5199999999995s)]
*  So January of 2018 and we all met up in Utah. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5102.759999999999s)]
*  And what was it? August of 2018? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5105.16s)]
*  Was the book out when I met you? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5106.92s)]
*  A book was out for a few months. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5108.76s)]
*  Yeah, the book was out for a few months. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5110.12s)]
*  But but yeah, Chris saw it early because Jared Shaw, my buddy, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5112.08s)]
*  gave him gave him a copy because of a favor I did for Jared and the SEAL teams, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5115.0s)]
*  which I just did because once again, you want to help good guys. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5118.6s)]
*  And he was getting out of the SEAL team. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5121.2s)]
*  So I introduced him to some people in the private sector and followed up. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5122.32s)]
*  And I forgot all about it. And he never did. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5125.2s)]
*  So he called me when the book was when he heard that I had a book coming out. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5127.56s)]
*  So a few months before it came out in November of 2017, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5130.4400000000005s)]
*  called me and said, hey, man, I always wanted to thank you for what you did for me. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5133.8s)]
*  And I couldn't remember what it was. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5136.44s)]
*  And and he told me what it was. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5137.88s)]
*  And I said, oh, man, how's it going? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5139.88s)]
*  And he said, it's going great. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5141.24s)]
*  But I heard you have a book coming out. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5142.72s)]
*  And I said, yeah, I can send you an early copy if you'd like. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5144.0s)]
*  And he said, well, I'd like to give it to a friend of mine if that's OK. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5146.0s)]
*  And I said, no problem. Who's that? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5148.5199999999995s)]
*  And Chris Pratt. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5149.76s)]
*  So and that's what I thought about playing the role when I was writing it [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5151.36s)]
*  before he'd been in Guardians, before he'd been in Jurassic World. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5154.04s)]
*  Really? So he'd been in the parks and recreation. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5156.44s)]
*  And you thought about him in Chubby Chris Pratt, Chris Pratt in the park. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5160.4s)]
*  And then but I saw him make the transformation to seal operator in Zero Dark 30. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5165.12s)]
*  I had a very small role. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5168.84s)]
*  So I thought, OK, I see this guy right here. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5170.08s)]
*  Look at that transformation. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5172.4800000000005s)]
*  And he seems like an inherently likable person on and off screen. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5173.8s)]
*  So and then I thought back then, I'm going to give Chris a chance here. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5177.04s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to help his career along because it looks like he needs. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5179.64s)]
*  This is me writing my first sentence of the book in Coronado, California, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5182.400000000001s)]
*  still in the SEAL teams in a little office off our bedroom. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5185.92s)]
*  But I thought of Chris Pratt. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5189.08s)]
*  And that's because back in the day, everybody loved Magnum P.I. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5190.04s)]
*  in the 80s because he was he was funny, but he could flip that switch [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5192.24s)]
*  and he could get it done in one episode. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5196.16s)]
*  We talked about this once before. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5197.84s)]
*  There's an episode where it's the first time on network television [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5199.84s)]
*  where a protagonist kills a bad guy who's unarmed. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5202.639999999999s)]
*  And it's an amazing episode. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5205.44s)]
*  They had to fight for it and they got it. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5206.76s)]
*  And now it's a classic episode of 80s television. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5208.599999999999s)]
*  And so I thought about that flipping that switch. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5211.48s)]
*  I thought about my background in the SEAL teams and coming home to wife [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5213.2s)]
*  and kids and all that stuff and having to flip that switch. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5216.4s)]
*  And I thought Chris is the guy who can pull this off. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5218.679999999999s)]
*  He hasn't done something like this. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5220.8s)]
*  Hasn't made an action films yet. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5221.84s)]
*  And so I thought of Chris and I thought Antoine being the director. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5223.32s)]
*  And I love what he's did with Training Day and Tears of the Sun and [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5226.52s)]
*  and a movie called Shooter based on Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5229.92s)]
*  And I just loved Antoine's work. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5233.28s)]
*  So I thought this is this is the guy. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5234.8s)]
*  And now we're all three executive producers on it. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5236.08s)]
*  And that's crazy. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5237.76s)]
*  So I wonder if you made that happen with your brain. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5238.92s)]
*  Like how much how much do you think you manifest things with your mind? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5241.68s)]
*  Well, it certainly didn't take up any of that bandwidth. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5246.360000000001s)]
*  Worried about it not happening. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5248.4400000000005s)]
*  I think a lot of that comes from just knowing what I wanted to do [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5250.5199999999995s)]
*  from a very early age, serve my country specifically as a SEAL [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5252.639999999999s)]
*  and then write thrillers back from my earliest days. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5255.28s)]
*  So I said this, I started building this foundation at age seven, eight, nine, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5257.879999999999s)]
*  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, reading all these guys like Tom Clancy and Nelson DeMille [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5261.16s)]
*  and A.J. Quinnell and J.C. Pollock and Mark Olden and Louis Lamour [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5264.879999999999s)]
*  and Stephen Hunter, all these guys back in the 80s who had protagonists [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5267.24s)]
*  with backgrounds I wanted in real life one day. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5270.12s)]
*  So I read all those and I just loved the magic in those pages [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5272.2s)]
*  and knew that one day I'd write those. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5275.04s)]
*  But that wasn't the Machiavellian. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5276.44s)]
*  I wasn't like, I'm going to read these today at age 12 [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5277.96s)]
*  so that one day I can write them at age 45. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5280.88s)]
*  No, I wanted to. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5284.28s)]
*  I just loved those books. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5285.24s)]
*  And then I was studying warfare and insurgencies and counterinsurgencies [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5286.8s)]
*  and terrorism and special operations. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5289.4s)]
*  So I had this academic study of warfare that's never stopped. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5291.24s)]
*  And then I had the practical application on the field of battle [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5293.72s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5295.84s)]
*  It all came together at the right time and place. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5296.72s)]
*  So I never worried about not making it. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5298.88s)]
*  I only saw a number one New York Times bestseller on all those books [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5301.24s)]
*  I read growing up. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5304.2s)]
*  I only saw those books like First Blood made into a film. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5305.48s)]
*  And so that was what was always in my mind. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5308.919999999999s)]
*  So if I write this book, it's going to be a number one New York Times [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5311.12s)]
*  bestseller and it's going to be optioned by whoever I want [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5313.4s)]
*  to make it a number one film. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5316.4s)]
*  And that stuff happened. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5317.639999999999s)]
*  But I didn't worry about it not happening, if that makes sense. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5319.719999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's a little naiveté, which is which seems to sometimes helps. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5322.28s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5326.24s)]
*  I didn't worry about the odds. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5327.4s)]
*  I didn't think people love to tell you the odds. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5328.48s)]
*  They're going to tell you how hard it is. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5330.599999999999s)]
*  What's your backup plan? You want to be an author? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5331.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, what are you really going to do when that fails? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5333.12s)]
*  Or you want to be a SEAL? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5335.16s)]
*  What are you going to do when you don't make it through BUDs? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5335.96s)]
*  Anybody says that to you, stop talking. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5337.44s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5339.12s)]
*  There's there's no benefit in thinking that way. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5340.92s)]
*  Negative. Yeah, I got to get rid of those people. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5343.72s)]
*  And if you do have a safety net, you might fall. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5345.68s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you might you might make it, but you might fall. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5348.2s)]
*  And there's there's something to that. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5351.96s)]
*  And I don't know why. Yeah, I don't understand it. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5353.44s)]
*  I don't understand the way reality works. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5355.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's that bandwidth because you're worried. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5358.48s)]
*  You're thinking about those other things where for me, all my heart and soul [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5359.88s)]
*  went into the book, continue to go into the books, every single sentence. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5363.6s)]
*  And for me, writing these kind of books, I don't have to go out there [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5367.08s)]
*  and find a sniper from Ramadi in 2006. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5370.0s)]
*  I don't have to go find somebody who is in an ambush. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5372.200000000001s)]
*  I can remember what it was like to be a sniper in Ramadi [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5374.120000000001s)]
*  or what it was like to be ambushed in Baghdad in 2006. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5376.8s)]
*  And then my protagonist gets in an ambush in Los Angeles, California. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5379.4800000000005s)]
*  So I go back and think of the feelings and emotions [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5382.360000000001s)]
*  associated with that event that I was in. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5384.64s)]
*  And then I apply those completely to a fictional narrative without any filters. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5386.52s)]
*  So I don't have to interview somebody and then have those answers [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5389.400000000001s)]
*  get filtered through other interviews that I've done or other movies [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5392.16s)]
*  I've seen or research that I've done and then go into the page of the book. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5395.2s)]
*  It goes right from my heart and soul right into that page. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5398.12s)]
*  So that's pretty amazing. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5400.36s)]
*  So I think that helped as well and made a stand out to Simon and Schuster [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5401.639999999999s)]
*  and makes it resonate with readers and resonate to Chris and Antoine [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5404.04s)]
*  because they both loved it and wanted to be wanted to be a part of it. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5406.92s)]
*  And now they're leading the charge on it and they want to be involved [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5409.24s)]
*  from the get go all the way through from from writing it to the [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5412.12s)]
*  being a part of the writers room and as an advisor and then learning that [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5416.04s)]
*  how that went down, doing the casting, seeing everybody that [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5418.96s)]
*  it came through wanting to be in it and then through production and post [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5421.639999999999s)]
*  production and then marketing and advertising into the premiere [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5424.48s)]
*  and then negotiations for a second season and a spinoff. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5426.799999999999s)]
*  And being a part of all that from the inside was I learned so much [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5429.36s)]
*  over the last couple of years. It's really cool. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5432.5199999999995s)]
*  Have you thought about writing new characters? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5434.04s)]
*  Have you thought about making a new James Reese or some something similar [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5437.679999999999s)]
*  or some complete different ecosystems, some complete different universe? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5441.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes. So I love doing this. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5446.4s)]
*  I absolutely love every part of the process writing this. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5448.08s)]
*  So I'm going to write James Reese for as long as I possibly can do that [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5450.32s)]
*  and have the nonfiction that I'm so passionate about with history. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5453.759999999999s)]
*  So that'll be coming out here in a year and a half. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5456.48s)]
*  And then there's another thing in the works that got put on a little bit of hold [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5458.24s)]
*  because the writer's strike. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5461.08s)]
*  But I'll text you about it when it when it comes through. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5461.92s)]
*  But there's some other things in the works [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5465.2s)]
*  that I thought would be done by now. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5467.599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, writer's strike. Everything goes on hold for that. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5469.04s)]
*  But there's some other things that will allow me to write some other characters [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5471.4s)]
*  and work on some other productions, I guess is the best way to put it. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5475.719999999999s)]
*  So it would be productions or would be novels or. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5478.4s)]
*  Yes. Some other. Some other. Exactly. Both. Both. Yeah. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5481.12s)]
*  Yeah. So we'll see. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5485.16s)]
*  There is like there's a thing about getting trapped in the success. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5486.48s)]
*  Like you have that. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5491.2s)]
*  And also you have to have Chris Pratt on board. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5491.88s)]
*  You can't you can't recast. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5493.96s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I don't think so. He's the guy. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5495.5199999999995s)]
*  He's the guy. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5497.72s)]
*  I mean, they do. How many Jack Rans have we had? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5498.4s)]
*  We've had one, two, three, four, like five [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5501.04s)]
*  Jack Rans up to this point. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5504.5599999999995s)]
*  So that one's that one survived and people accepted that. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5505.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's so close, you know, so close to the time that a book came out. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5508.08s)]
*  Maybe not. But yeah, Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5510.92s)]
*  were pretty close to those movies in the 80s. Yeah. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5514.92s)]
*  In early 90s. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5517.96s)]
*  So there's so there is that. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5519.28s)]
*  But you never yeah, you never know how things are going to go. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5520.360000000001s)]
*  So I guess James Bond's of their been. Yep. Exactly. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5522.0s)]
*  That continues. And so so there is so so there is that there is precedent there. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5524.4400000000005s)]
*  But but the casting was was really interesting because you see these people [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5530.12s)]
*  who you have you've grown up watching who during the time [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5533.6s)]
*  it's kind of COVID, what is COVID time. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5536.5599999999995s)]
*  So they're doing screen test and you're seeing these people [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5538.719999999999s)]
*  that everyone knows the name of, like doing a screen test, wanting to be in the show. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5540.36s)]
*  And I'm like part of that is crazy. It's crazy. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5543.32s)]
*  And then Taylor, of course, just knocked out of the park [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5546.5199999999995s)]
*  and we saw the screen test with him and Chris. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5548.32s)]
*  Like there was no question like Taylor is Ben Edwards and Taylor is just an awesome dude. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5550.32s)]
*  He's so fired up to get to where we're just texting on the way over here. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5553.799999999999s)]
*  And he was he's so excited to get to work on this next one. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5556.16s)]
*  And yeah, he just elevated that character to a new level. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5558.759999999999s)]
*  And such a good dude playing a bad guy, though. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5562.28s)]
*  Yeah, but how he gets to go back and kind of like play around with it a little bit. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5564.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we get great action sequences that are just next level. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5567.32s)]
*  And and Taylor's just such a good he's one of the guys also totally normal. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5570.679999999999s)]
*  Totally cool. You want to sit down, have a beer with them, have a whiskey with them, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5573.96s)]
*  have a coffee with them. Yeah, they exist. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5576.44s)]
*  Just an awesome dude. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5578.04s)]
*  It's just in that world, it all it all celebrates people that aren't [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5579.08s)]
*  aren't genuine. Strange. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5583.32s)]
*  It's strange. It's a pretend business. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5585.28s)]
*  It's a business of pretending. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5587.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Everybody in that everybody in the show that I can think of, Jean Triple Horn. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5589.44s)]
*  Amazing. She paid the secretary of defense, Lorraine Hartley. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5592.56s)]
*  And she's been around. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5596.52s)]
*  That lady's done some great movies. Amazing movie. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5597.6s)]
*  And so nice and so kind and so normal. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5599.56s)]
*  But everybody, Monica Garrett, amazing, who's in 1883. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5602.72s)]
*  Right after our show, he left and went to do 1883. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5607.080000000001s)]
*  And such a good dude, just a normal dude that you just want to hang out with. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5609.400000000001s)]
*  They do see you at the UFC together. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5613.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. We saw you at USC in January or July 2nd. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5614.96s)]
*  We went up there for the the terminal list thing. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5617.92s)]
*  And Chris now has the blood splattered terminal list thing from the octagon. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5619.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. Framed. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5623.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. I got a piece of it. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5624.8s)]
*  I got a piece of the blood from that night. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5626.68s)]
*  Oh, that's right. The terminal sponsored the the actual event. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5628.16s)]
*  Yeah. It was on the canvas. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5631.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5632.4400000000005s)]
*  He's got the whole thing and it's all covered in blood. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5633.400000000001s)]
*  And I have a square from it that's covered in blood. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5635.28s)]
*  But yeah, he's got the whole banner, the whole middle part of the cage, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5637.16s)]
*  which is pretty cool. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5639.76s)]
*  Yeah. We shared out camp together and hung out. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5640.76s)]
*  He's fucking as normal as can be. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5643.0s)]
*  If you didn't know that that guy was a movie star, you would never guess it. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5645.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's a big dude, too. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5648.28s)]
*  So he's you know, it's hard for him to blend in, I think. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5650.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5651.96s)]
*  He's tall. He's wrestler. Yeah. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5653.28s)]
*  Good solid guy. But everybody on that set was so cool. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5655.12s)]
*  But it comes down to Chris and Antoine to the leadership. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5657.24s)]
*  And it comes down to them setting the tone at that Antoine at that strategic level. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5660.0s)]
*  So up there as the as the director, executive producer right there at the top, [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5663.599999999999s)]
*  setting that tone strategically. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5667.4s)]
*  And then Chris right there also as the tactical level inspiration for everybody on set. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5669.04s)]
*  So everybody wanted to be there and they're the top of their games. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5674.04s)]
*  And so many people came up to me on set and they didn't have to. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5676.96s)]
*  And they said they'd been on hundreds of sets in Hollywood. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5679.88s)]
*  And they've never felt like this on a set before. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5681.92s)]
*  And it was just something about it. It was inspiring. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5684.280000000001s)]
*  They wanted to be there, do their best work and crush it because it was fun. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5686.280000000001s)]
*  It was fun to go to work. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5690.12s)]
*  Well, there's also there's not a lot of guys like you that wind up being successful authors. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5691.0s)]
*  It's a very small, tiny group of people that have had the kind of real world [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5695.4400000000005s)]
*  experience that you've had and then conveyed that into fiction. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5700.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, for me, it's a very, very natural and very therapeutic. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5704.36s)]
*  But also I knew what I wanted to do and wake up at age 45 and say, hey, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5708.4s)]
*  can you make money at writing? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5711.48s)]
*  What should I have been reading for the last 30 years in preparation for this? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5712.76s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5717.28s)]
*  It's like your life was like sort of ordained. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5718.36s)]
*  It's almost like destiny. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5720.72s)]
*  Well, I think it's my parents made made reading a natural part of my life. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5722.08s)]
*  It wasn't something that was forced upon me. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5726.2s)]
*  It was just as natural as anything else. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5727.96s)]
*  And just reading is what we did. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5729.6s)]
*  My mom's a librarian. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5730.84s)]
*  So grew up with the love of books and reading. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5731.88s)]
*  So it's been as normal as having a phone, I guess, for a lot of kids today. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5734.08s)]
*  But as normal for me to have books, I've never been without a book. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5737.32s)]
*  I've never been not in the middle of a book. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5740.12s)]
*  And when I finish one, I start the next one. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5741.8s)]
*  I've never had like a week wondering what I should read next. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5743.28s)]
*  I've never had that my entire life. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5746.32s)]
*  Do you read? Do you listen rather to audiobooks? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5747.84s)]
*  Nope. No. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5751.08s)]
*  I always read. Yeah, I always read. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5751.92s)]
*  That's how I how I grew up that I love turning the pages. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5753.2s)]
*  But audiobooks are the fastest growing segment of publishing. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5756.92s)]
*  And I'm so fortunate to have Ray Porter, who's also an awesome guy [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5759.44s)]
*  by the Shakespearean trained actor. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5762.12s)]
*  He's been in tons of shows. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5764.04s)]
*  If you look up Ray Porter, you can see just a list of shows that he's been in. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5765.12s)]
*  He's great. He's great as a voiceover guy, too. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5768.12s)]
*  It's like he does so many different accents. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5771.44s)]
*  That's tough. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5773.96s)]
*  I think about him now as I'm writing, I think about, well, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5774.96s)]
*  maybe I should say that this person has some crazy accent in the first sentence [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5777.759999999999s)]
*  so that Ray doesn't read and get halfway down the page and have to go back [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5781.799999999999s)]
*  and then start with it again. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5784.96s)]
*  So I do think about Ray as I'm writing and trying to make it right. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5786.28s)]
*  Things that make make sense for him says to us to be to be kind. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5789.4s)]
*  So I don't get to the end. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5793.88s)]
*  And all of a sudden say this person had some, you know, Rhodesian accent. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5794.88s)]
*  Has anybody ever come up to you and said, hey, are you writing about me? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5798.96s)]
*  No, no, not yet. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5804.8s)]
*  Not yet. But for the people that I write about that could be bad guys, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5806.639999999999s)]
*  I don't have contact with any of them. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5810.96s)]
*  Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5812.16s)]
*  So not let them hear about it. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5813.8s)]
*  Not yet. There's some. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5815.24s)]
*  And it's you know, we're all products of our experience and, you know, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5816.48s)]
*  what we what we decide to study. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5820.16s)]
*  And so there are maybe some characters in these books that might seem similar [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5821.5599999999995s)]
*  to some people at higher levels of government or military. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5825.639999999999s)]
*  And I kind of morph some things together and maybe make them worse [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5829.4s)]
*  or sometimes better than they actually are. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5832.92s)]
*  So, yeah, we're a product of our of our environments and and then [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5835.36s)]
*  the education we choose to give ourselves these days [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5838.92s)]
*  and what we pay attention to in our life experience. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5841.08s)]
*  So all that ends up in these pages. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5842.96s)]
*  So no one's come up yet, though, and been upset about it. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5845.12s)]
*  But about, you know, one of the things that you you deal with is like some very, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5847.48s)]
*  very corrupt and evil people that are involved in military. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5851.2s)]
*  Yeah. That are in management positions and executive positions [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5855.2s)]
*  that fuck over soldiers. Yeah. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5859.88s)]
*  And that's have you encountered that in real life or is that just your knowledge of that? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5862.6s)]
*  Well, we all saw it with Afghanistan. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5867.56s)]
*  So we so there is that you see the process of people sitting on these boards [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5869.16s)]
*  after their time in uniform and then approving gigantic contracts for these companies. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5873.28s)]
*  It's in positions that they were just in prior where they had that chance to approve. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5878.16s)]
*  And now they're on this board. So that's just a part of it. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5882.36s)]
*  And then I saw people get [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5885.8s)]
*  get scapegoated for certain things in the military to protect others, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5888.28s)]
*  higher up the chain. And, you know, that's just how it goes. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5891.4s)]
*  I think it's any big bureaucracy, really. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5893.76s)]
*  But I think it's been a part of just the human experience from the beginning of time, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5895.5599999999995s)]
*  just like violence. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5899.599999999999s)]
*  What I do hear from people is is that the violence part, some people like that. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5900.48s)]
*  And like is probably the wrong word, but they they recognize [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5905.0s)]
*  that violence has been a part of the human condition from the beginning of time. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5909.32s)]
*  And they like that I don't pull any punches in the pages of these things. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5912.0s)]
*  Some people hate it. They like a sanitized version of violence. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5914.799999999999s)]
*  And there's plenty of that out there. And that's not me. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5917.96s)]
*  So for me, it's all about the story. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5920.24s)]
*  And I never look at say reviews talking about negative comments before. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5921.919999999999s)]
*  I never think about, oh, what's what's selling right now? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5925.48s)]
*  I've never had even my publisher and I didn't know going in, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5928.0s)]
*  like what was going to happen with agents and publishers. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5930.16s)]
*  And if they were going to say, OK, we have this next time. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5932.599999999999s)]
*  Can you lay off on this or can you can you do this a little more [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5935.5599999999995s)]
*  because this is selling right now? [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5938.44s)]
*  Never, never even a hint. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5940.599999999999s)]
*  They have had complete creative control on that side, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5942.04s)]
*  which is different than screenwriting and screenwriting. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5944.48s)]
*  You have a team and all those scripts and outlines. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5946.28s)]
*  They go all the way up to the top of Amazon and back down with notes. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5948.8s)]
*  And then you incorporate those or you argue and come to some sort of an agreement [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5951.48s)]
*  or whatever it might be. But team oriented on this side. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5955.72s)]
*  Only me on this side. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5958.44s)]
*  And I love that my publisher and agent have never hinted at doing anything [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5959.639999999999s)]
*  differently, because if it fails, it's all on me. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5963.08s)]
*  I can't say, man, I knew I shouldn't listen to my agent or I should. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5965.36s)]
*  And my only vision of agents is it was Californication and Entourage. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5967.96s)]
*  Like I had no idea. I didn't know any. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5971.48s)]
*  So that's what I thought agents were. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5973.2s)]
*  And that's not my that's not my agent. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5974.32s)]
*  And she doesn't give any input into into what I do. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5975.96s)]
*  That's very fortunate. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5978.4s)]
*  Is it different than that from most people's experience? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5979.72s)]
*  Like how many agents have you had over the years? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5982.44s)]
*  I've had a few agents, but I've had the same manager since I was open mic her. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5984.72s)]
*  Do you have to have an agent now or is it just a manager? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5988.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't have to, I guess. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5990.12s)]
*  I probably could do everything with a manager. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5992.0s)]
*  But I've I've had the same agent since 2007. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5993.5199999999995s)]
*  And I've had the same manager since 1991. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5996.8s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. No kidding. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=5999.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. Yeah. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6001.599999999999s)]
*  My manager found me when I was a beginner. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6002.84s)]
*  No. When did you get to L.A.? Ninety four. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6005.12s)]
*  Ninety four. Oh, geez. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6008.04s)]
*  Before. Yeah. That's wild. Yeah. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6010.0s)]
*  No. Are they an L.A. based person or New York based? [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6012.679999999999s)]
*  OK. Yeah. Still with. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6015.24s)]
*  Well, one of them's L.A. based, one of them is New York based. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6016.4s)]
*  But yeah, I've had the same people forever. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6019.36s)]
*  And fortunately, they get me. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6021.5199999999995s)]
*  But that's the thing that, you know, you can run into the wrong. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6023.44s)]
*  In Hollywood, they're notorious for taking things that are very successful [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6027.44s)]
*  and fucking them up because they have their input on it. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6031.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, that's what they did with the Chappelle show. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6033.719999999999s)]
*  And Dave Chappelle was on top of the world. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6035.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The executives at Comedy Central fucked that whole thing up. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6037.839999999999s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6041.16s)]
*  They were telling him, do this and do that. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6042.04s)]
*  And you can do this and stop saying this and stop doing that. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6043.92s)]
*  And he was like, fuck this. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6046.92s)]
*  And he went to Africa and quit the show. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6048.72s)]
*  I remember it was famous and didn't do stand up for years for money. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6050.6s)]
*  Like literally would show up in Seattle. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6055.24s)]
*  He would bring a microphone and like a little portable speaker. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6058.4800000000005s)]
*  Really? Just to stand up in the park. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6063.64s)]
*  No way. He didn't know that part. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6065.72s)]
*  I remember when he quit the show and went to Africa and came back. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6067.4s)]
*  And it seemed like he was gone for a decade almost. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6070.0s)]
*  He was gone for a long time and he just was thinking about things. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6071.68s)]
*  Trying to figure out what he was doing and just didn't. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6076.96s)]
*  I mean, the kind of integrity that he had to walk away from, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6080.320000000001s)]
*  I think it was like 50 million dollars. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6084.280000000001s)]
*  Crazy. Yeah. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6086.400000000001s)]
*  Was it like a record setting type of a deal? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6087.360000000001s)]
*  Record setting. Giant. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6089.280000000001s)]
*  It was the biggest show on cable. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6090.64s)]
*  It was huge. And it only did two seasons. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6092.12s)]
*  It's to this day, I think, the best sketch comedy show that's ever been made. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6094.16s)]
*  And he walked away from it because they fucked it up. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6097.8s)]
*  If they just left him alone, if they were smart, they're like, have fun. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6101.160000000001s)]
*  Right. Like what they do at South Park. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6104.160000000001s)]
*  Just we'll leave you alone. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6106.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Have a good time. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6108.04s)]
*  You know what you're doing. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6109.160000000001s)]
*  There'll be some controversy every now and again. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6109.72s)]
*  But of course, that's just how it goes. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6111.280000000001s)]
*  But controversy with who? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6113.360000000001s)]
*  People that weren't fans anyway. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6114.92s)]
*  Right. I mean, it was so funny. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6116.56s)]
*  The bottom line was it was really, really, really funny. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6118.240000000001s)]
*  And they came in and they made it no fun. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6121.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Our little guy just got into it. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6123.160000000001s)]
*  He's watching them all right now. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6124.4800000000005s)]
*  So good. Clayton Bigsby, the blind white supremacist [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6126.280000000001s)]
*  that doesn't know he's black. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6130.16s)]
*  The whole thing is genius. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6131.2s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6132.68s)]
*  And it's so different. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6133.88s)]
*  Also, it's also so different. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6134.72s)]
*  It's not so good. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6136.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. It's so good. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6137.36s)]
*  Which is fantastic. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6139.32s)]
*  They wanted to safe in it up a little bit. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6140.12s)]
*  And they started fucking with him and talking to him about it. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6142.2s)]
*  And it just felt awful. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6144.96s)]
*  And, you know, he's a man of integrity. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6146.8s)]
*  And he just said, fuck this. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6149.5199999999995s)]
*  But they ruined it. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6151.2s)]
*  The executives ruined the greatest sketch comedy show of all time. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6152.2s)]
*  And they got one of the greatest comedians that's ever walked the face of the earth [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6156.16s)]
*  to walk away from his own show. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6159.76s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. Amazing. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6161.52s)]
*  They can fuck it up. Yeah. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6163.08s)]
*  They can get in there. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6164.6s)]
*  You know, and what a genius. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6165.76s)]
*  I mean, his stuff. Oh, my gosh. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6166.96s)]
*  Yeah. So great. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6168.88s)]
*  No, he's awesome. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6170.2s)]
*  He was out here week one. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6171.360000000001s)]
*  The second week that we were open at the mothership, I saw him and he christened [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6172.92s)]
*  the little room. Oh, it's so awesome. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6177.4400000000005s)]
*  That mother. It looks so amazing. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6179.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, everybody listening to this is obviously watched the video [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6181.84s)]
*  and seen that drone go in those doors and take the tour of that whole place. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6184.400000000001s)]
*  The day you opened, I think it was that rant, the Bill Burr rant, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6188.799999999999s)]
*  which is the perfect rant to have over it. So great. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6191.5199999999995s)]
*  Perfect. That guy. I love listening to that guy. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6194.44s)]
*  It's so funny. Yeah. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6196.5199999999995s)]
*  And that rant was just so perfect for that video and what we're trying to do. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6197.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You guys are crushing. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6202.12s)]
*  It's turned Austin into like the comedy capital of the country. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6203.2s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6205.96s)]
*  I remember you telling me about it beforehand, you know, and I was like, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6207.04s)]
*  oh, yeah, you came to the right place when you left. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6209.92s)]
*  I remember you looking at a couple of different places. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6212.04s)]
*  And I think you chose. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6213.88s)]
*  I know you chose the right spot to come and then to build this [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6215.04s)]
*  way you built here is so inspiring and so cool. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6217.88s)]
*  But that one, when I saw that video, I was like, oh, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6221.16s)]
*  because you told me about like a year in advance, a year and a half, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6224.0s)]
*  whatever it was. And I was so excited when I saw that video [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6226.32s)]
*  and I texted you about it. And that was just awesome. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6228.72s)]
*  I'm just so fired up that that is here. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6230.92s)]
*  It's a destination. You made this a destination for comedy. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6232.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6235.52s)]
*  It's almost surreal. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6237.4400000000005s)]
*  When we're there, Tony and I, Tony Ingegliffe and I were there. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6239.0s)]
*  Sometimes we just go, how the fuck do we do this? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6241.72s)]
*  Can't believe we did this. Yeah, it really worked. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6244.4800000000005s)]
*  And it was such a weird gamble because you had a lead. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6247.0s)]
*  I left L.A. in the middle of this Spotify deal, this enormous deal. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6250.12s)]
*  And they were like, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6253.72s)]
*  You're going to go to Texas? [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6255.64s)]
*  How are you going to get guests? How are you going to do that? [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6257.12s)]
*  You know, it was like there's so much to it. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6259.2s)]
*  Like, how do you do this? [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6261.76s)]
*  But I was like, I just like I have a compass. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6263.2s)]
*  Like, it's like that way. Go that way. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6267.52s)]
*  And you always had that. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6269.72s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I'm a risk taker. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6272.56s)]
*  Like when I feel like something is the thing to do, you should take a risk. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6275.24s)]
*  Yeah, you have to. Yeah. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6279.04s)]
*  I think that that's a that's a giant component for success. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6280.08s)]
*  You cannot play safe. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6284.6s)]
*  And there's sometimes where it seems counterintuitive [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6286.24s)]
*  and other people are going to think it's a terrible idea. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6289.4400000000005s)]
*  And you got to not listen to them. Yeah. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6291.56s)]
*  You got to be able to just jump on it. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6293.56s)]
*  Yeah. We call it in sniper school, a bold adjustment. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6295.6s)]
*  So you have a certain amount of time on that line. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6297.68s)]
*  And you have especially if you're doing something with like a an old M14 [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6299.72s)]
*  type of a thing where you're starting out and you're doing these clicks [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6303.64s)]
*  on your on your scope and on your on your elevation and like bold adjustments. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6306.64s)]
*  Gentlemen, I remember them walking down the line saying that. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6311.08s)]
*  So you're not like taking a tiny click because they've got to get people [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6313.4800000000005s)]
*  through this course or get them out of the course or whatever it is. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6316.04s)]
*  So bold adjustment. OK, went there. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6318.68s)]
*  Boom. Halfway back. Bang. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6320.84s)]
*  You're on and said these little tiny, very safe, tiny little adjustments [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6322.160000000001s)]
*  that keep you on that line for another hour. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6325.8s)]
*  Bold adjustments is what they told us. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6328.160000000001s)]
*  So that's what that's what it sounds like here. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6329.64s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, it's awesome. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6332.0s)]
*  I can't wait to go and check it out. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6333.400000000001s)]
*  It's I think it sounds crazy, but I think the universe rewards that. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6334.56s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you have to. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6338.84s)]
*  Otherwise, you just have a safe. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6339.84s)]
*  I mean, you get one shot. Yeah. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6340.92s)]
*  One shot at life. Yeah. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6342.96s)]
*  And one shot to well, you can learn from successes and failures. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6344.280000000001s)]
*  So why not learn from them and take some risks and do it? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6348.0s)]
*  Because you're not coming back. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6351.320000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe we don't know. Yeah. Who knows? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6352.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, who knows? Maybe you're just doing it over and over and over and over again. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6354.400000000001s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why I'm willing to take these chances. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6357.4400000000005s)]
*  Because I fucked it up before. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6360.919999999999s)]
*  And I know now it's now's the time to get moving. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6362.5599999999995s)]
*  This is your 500th time. Yeah. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6365.12s)]
*  Going through this. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6367.2s)]
*  Remember when you stayed in L.A. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6367.799999999999s)]
*  The last life. Let's get the fuck out of there. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6368.879999999999s)]
*  Time to go. Time to go. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6370.919999999999s)]
*  Let's not be depressed. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6372.08s)]
*  Yeah. The first time I came out was L.A. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6373.04s)]
*  And that was a crazy time to come out because that was covid. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6374.639999999999s)]
*  So the book hit the New York Times list. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6376.719999999999s)]
*  And then you text it and I jumped in the car and drove on out. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6378.44s)]
*  There was nobody on the roads. That was crazy. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6381.599999999999s)]
*  That was April of early late April, early May of 2020. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6383.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6387.44s)]
*  Nobody on the roads. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6388.12s)]
*  Nobody on the 405. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6388.96s)]
*  Like that was super weird. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6390.16s)]
*  Yeah. And then we got to talk about covid on the on the thing. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6392.44s)]
*  And I remember it was still a time when when the Wuhan lab was conspiracy theory stuff. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6395.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And I remember just that we talked about it. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6399.36s)]
*  I didn't put it as eloquently as as John Stewart did when he talked about the Wuhan lab [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6401.28s)]
*  coronavirus thing and the Hershey bit where he does on. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6405.28s)]
*  Hey, if there's a outbreak of chocolatey goodness in Hershey, Pennsylvania, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6408.4800000000005s)]
*  you might want to look at the chocolate factory. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6411.88s)]
*  Like I was genius, but we did talk about it. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6413.64s)]
*  And at the time, you know, that was conspiracy theory craziness. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6415.16s)]
*  And I was like, well, there is a lab there. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6418.04s)]
*  So if I was a detective in any big city in the United States, [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6419.96s)]
*  I'd probably call that a clue. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6423.48s)]
*  Well, you want to look into it. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6424.8s)]
*  You should look into it. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6425.88s)]
*  And also, how did that become a conspiracy theory? [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6426.72s)]
*  I mean, what what fantastic level of manipulation and propaganda [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6429.92s)]
*  that they impart on the United States that that was a conspiracy theory, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6434.96s)]
*  that a respiratory coronavirus lab in Wuhan, China definitely couldn't be the place. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6439.16s)]
*  It's like a block away. Yeah. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6444.8s)]
*  It's certainly not that place. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6446.2s)]
*  It could be anything else. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6447.36s)]
*  We're not sure. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6448.2s)]
*  But it's certainly not the coronavirus lab a block away from the outbreak. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6448.839999999999s)]
*  Like looking back on it. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6452.2s)]
*  At the time, I had been very fortunate to be friends with people [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6454.16s)]
*  that actually understood viruses and actually understood, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6457.5599999999995s)]
*  you know, the fear and cleavage sites and the way that viruses [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6461.639999999999s)]
*  normally jump from an animal host to a human, the natural spillover. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6465.44s)]
*  There's so many different factors that pointed to the [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6471.2s)]
*  the idea that this is a gain of function research project that went wrong. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6475.12s)]
*  And that's what it was. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6480.68s)]
*  And there's still people out there that deny that. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6481.92s)]
*  That one little guy, that little fellow, that little guy. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6485.12s)]
*  Yeah, you see, there is no evidence. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6487.8s)]
*  That little fucker. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6492.360000000001s)]
*  But that's the that's the manipulation part. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6493.240000000001s)]
*  We're as a populace, we have to realize that we are being manipulated [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6494.76s)]
*  in many instances. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6499.280000000001s)]
*  And that one guy has been manipulating people that way. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6500.8s)]
*  His entire career. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6504.36s)]
*  Did you ever read the Robert Kennedy book? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6505.24s)]
*  No, it's on my list, but I have not. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6506.92s)]
*  Holy shit. Pretty good. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6508.88s)]
*  I need to read that. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6511.76s)]
*  So these days I read for people coming on the podcast. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6512.64s)]
*  I've read every book for people that have come on thus far. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6515.96s)]
*  I don't know if I'll always be able to. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6517.88s)]
*  But I think some of those books would have fallen to lower [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6519.72s)]
*  on the priority list if they weren't coming on the podcast. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6522.8s)]
*  But some of those conversations that I've had in the books I've read [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6525.08s)]
*  have made it into the pages of the novel. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6527.6s)]
*  So there's all this overlap to include this one. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6529.28s)]
*  Brian Moore has a book called The Able Archers, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6531.96s)]
*  and it talks about a nuclear exchange that almost happened [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6534.2s)]
*  between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1983. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6536.759999999999s)]
*  And there was one guy in the Soviet Union, an officer on watch that night [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6540.0s)]
*  who was not supposed to be there. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6543.599999999999s)]
*  The guy was supposed to be there, got sick. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6544.639999999999s)]
*  So this one guy steps up, goes in for the person who's sick. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6546.36s)]
*  And he's the one guy who studied the United States and he's he's [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6549.16s)]
*  intellectual, and he's put in this time and effort into understanding [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6552.599999999999s)]
*  the strategic kind of aspects of this conflict in the Cold War. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6555.32s)]
*  And there's a launch from the United States. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6559.2s)]
*  ICBMs heading towards the Soviet Union. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6561.16s)]
*  That's what shows up on their screen. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6564.0s)]
*  And what he's supposed to do is launch back and he has pressure [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6566.24s)]
*  from above to launch. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6569.5599999999995s)]
*  It's the protocol. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6571.76s)]
*  And he doesn't because he's like, this isn't right. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6573.08s)]
*  And it was a glitch in their system that showed. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6575.32s)]
*  Yeah. And there's all these other things that play to [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6578.48s)]
*  Korean Airlines flight 007 that was shot down earlier. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6581.04s)]
*  There's all these things happening that would lend themselves. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6583.599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6586.76s)]
*  So we and those those documents were just I think it was. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6588.2s)]
*  It might be I may be off by a year or two, but I think it was 1999 [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6590.8s)]
*  when these documents were finally declassified. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6594.240000000001s)]
*  So well after the end of the Cold War and but things like that. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6597.320000000001s)]
*  So I read that book and had that conversation with this guy. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6601.4800000000005s)]
*  And he's a really nice guy, great guy, been in the intelligence world [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6604.0s)]
*  his whole career. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6607.0s)]
*  And that made it into the pages of this novel. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6608.0s)]
*  So there's overlap. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6609.68s)]
*  But but Robert Kennedy has not been on the podcast yet. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6610.64s)]
*  So I have not read that book, but I've been meaning to read it. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6613.0s)]
*  Sounds fascinating. He was just on Russell Brand's podcast. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6615.240000000001s)]
*  And he talked about his uncle and his father's assassination. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6618.44s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6623.799999999999s)]
*  He his recall is amazing. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6625.32s)]
*  His ability to just remember all these different pieces that were in play, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6628.48s)]
*  particularly with the JFK assassination and Lee Harvey Oswald [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6634.12s)]
*  and the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA asset and that he had defected [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6637.839999999999s)]
*  to Russia, but as a fake defection and that all the the different pieces [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6641.5199999999995s)]
*  that were in place that you could point to, there's [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6644.96s)]
*  there's so much evidence. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6647.599999999999s)]
*  He's like, if we went into this, he said to [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6649.16s)]
*  to Russell that if we just wanted to cover [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6653.599999999999s)]
*  the evidence that the CIA killed JFK, he goes, this would be a 10 hour podcast. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6657.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it's fascinating. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6663.16s)]
*  And it makes it you haven't gotten to the stage in the book yet. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6665.08s)]
*  But I don't want to give too much away. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6667.4s)]
*  Don't get it. Yeah, no, no. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6668.44s)]
*  But you like when you get to a certain part, you'll be like, no way. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6669.48s)]
*  Because I think nobody is going to expect this part of the book to [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6672.48s)]
*  to go the way it does. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6676.2s)]
*  But point being, it takes us back to that assassination. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6676.88s)]
*  And so crazy early 90s member, maybe you had Oliver North on on here, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6680.04s)]
*  which is Oliver North's books. Fascinating. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6683.6s)]
*  But you have the Congress mandating mandate law [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6686.12s)]
*  that the United States has to declassify these documents by a certain date. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6690.04s)]
*  And two administrations after a visit from the CIA neglect to do that. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6694.4s)]
*  Or they let some things out. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6698.16s)]
*  But not everything like is mandated by law all these years after. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6699.24s)]
*  So if they're not involved, then they might not be. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6703.56s)]
*  But they're certainly going well out of their way to make themselves look guilty. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6706.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, really trying hard to make themselves look good. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6709.6s)]
*  But I feel like them making themselves look guilty is safer [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6711.4800000000005s)]
*  than removing all doubt. Maybe. Yeah. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6715.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, because it is because we're not talking about I mean, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6718.280000000001s)]
*  Tucker talked about it on his television show and he boldly claimed the CIA, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6720.92s)]
*  you know, killed him. But it was a weird way he did it. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6725.68s)]
*  Like he said, someone told me and he doesn't release that person's name. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6728.200000000001s)]
*  It's like the way Robert Kennedy Junior talks about it on Russell Brand's podcast. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6731.68s)]
*  It's like in depth. Yeah. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6737.12s)]
*  But it's just this holy shit. Yeah, it's incredible. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6739.72s)]
*  I mean, in most of my books, I make mention in this one in particular, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6743.04s)]
*  go back to the church hearings and the Pike hearings of the 70s that [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6746.240000000001s)]
*  expose some overreach by agencies in the federal government, particularly the CIA. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6750.0s)]
*  But as it pertains to the Kennedy assassination, it is so strange. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6754.4400000000005s)]
*  All these years later, they still walk into the Oval Office [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6758.0s)]
*  and have a private conversation and walk out. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6760.8s)]
*  And all of a sudden, these these documents that are mandated to be released by law are not. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6762.52s)]
*  Like so odd. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6767.400000000001s)]
*  But this one also saw a friend of mine married into the Kennedy family. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6768.72s)]
*  So I went back to Hinesport, got to meet Robert Kennedy and spent some time with Ethel Kennedy. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6771.24s)]
*  And it was it was amazing. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6774.92s)]
*  And that experience also informs if you've gotten to that chapter already, [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6776.360000000001s)]
*  where he goes to meet the old woman. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6780.92s)]
*  And so that part inspired this book right here. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6782.6s)]
*  And that was really cool to be back there and see. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6785.56s)]
*  Look at this chair. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6787.679999999999s)]
*  And in this chair, there's a little little table next to it. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6788.799999999999s)]
*  And you see a picture of JFK watching the election results come in. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6791.719999999999s)]
*  And you look at the picture and you look at the chair and it's him in that chair right there. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6795.839999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. It was really interesting to be in that that part of the world, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6800.0s)]
*  in that place with that family. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6804.599999999999s)]
*  But he had inspired this history. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6807.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Big time. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6808.919999999999s)]
*  But he had inspired this. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6810.639999999999s)]
*  And I mean, who knows if we'll ever get to the bottom of that assassination. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6811.879999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't that long ago. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6815.44s)]
*  Like when we were born, we thought it was a long time ago, like, let's say 1983 or something. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6816.76s)]
*  Sixty three is a long time ago when you're a kid. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6820.200000000001s)]
*  But now looking back, it's everything relative. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6822.88s)]
*  It's that time space continuum thing, whatever that is. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6824.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a real deal. Time speeding up as you get older. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6826.56s)]
*  And it's I saw a meme the other day and it said if Marty McFly went back in time [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6828.8s)]
*  today, he'd be going back to 1993 or something like that. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6833.320000000001s)]
*  She's yeah. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6836.84s)]
*  I know. How about World War One was 100 years ago? Crazy. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6838.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah, a little over. But yeah, yeah. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6842.320000000001s)]
*  And that's actually nothing now. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6844.240000000001s)]
*  That's nothing. World War Two less. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6846.68s)]
*  Yeah. Vietnam, much less. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6848.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Korea less. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6850.16s)]
*  Yeah. And Donny Edwards, who has the best defense foundation, he [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6852.16s)]
*  he has a picture of himself with a World War One veteran, which is pretty cool. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6855.88s)]
*  And so my daughter, who's 17, we've been we went to Pearl Harbor and took 62 veterans [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6860.320000000001s)]
*  back to Pearl Harbor for the 80th anniversary commemoration event about a year and a half ago. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6864.56s)]
*  Last June, we went to Normandy. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6868.68s)]
*  So she's on Normandy with somebody who is the first out of his landing craft [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6870.400000000001s)]
*  storming the beach, and she's there on this beach with him. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6874.04s)]
*  He's 100 years old right now, hearing that story from him. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6876.52s)]
*  And I'm getting pictures of them talking together. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6879.72s)]
*  And so one day she'll say, I have a picture with a World War Two veteran. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6881.6s)]
*  How many what percentage of guys died on that beach? [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6886.080000000001s)]
*  I don't know exactly that exact numbers, but it was a lot. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6889.080000000001s)]
*  And then a lot when you I mean, you think about the Pacific campaign. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6892.68s)]
*  And they did that over and over again, island after island after island. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6895.76s)]
*  And then those guys came home. What did they do? [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6900.280000000001s)]
*  They got back to work. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6902.280000000001s)]
*  They didn't complain. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6903.56s)]
*  They built the country into what it is today. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6904.360000000001s)]
*  And that's a little different. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6907.0s)]
*  That was a different time. Different kind of human being. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6908.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of those guys didn't even talk about it till just a little while ago. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6909.92s)]
*  It's just fascinating. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6912.84s)]
*  The the different kinds of human beings that exist depend [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6913.88s)]
*  upon the amount of adversity they've overcome. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6917.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6919.320000000001s)]
*  I think that's why they started out. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6921.52s)]
*  We're bound. They did this this this study and they found it was World War One. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6922.360000000001s)]
*  I might get this a little off, but the general gist is is on track. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6927.240000000001s)]
*  And they found that people dying in the North Atlantic, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6931.360000000001s)]
*  that were there like treading water, trying to survive, trying to signal another boat [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6933.4s)]
*  where the older guys were surviving and the younger guys that should be [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6937.04s)]
*  in better shape their whole life ahead of them were the ones that weren't. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6940.639999999999s)]
*  And they thought, well, this is because those people haven't faced [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6944.16s)]
*  as much adversity as the older people. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6946.679999999999s)]
*  So they started this outbound thing and get kids in the outdoors, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6948.759999999999s)]
*  have them do a solo out there by themselves for a couple nights [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6951.28s)]
*  and put them in these positions that are uncomfortable. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6954.28s)]
*  And so I think that's why that started. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6956.44s)]
*  But there's something to that. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6958.36s)]
*  Isn't that the case with like ultra marathon runners? [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6959.48s)]
*  A lot of those like Kam Haines age, like 55, maybe. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6961.88s)]
*  Probably. Yeah, probably. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6965.64s)]
*  But yeah, the younger generation, they think we're on an ultra marathon [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6967.6s)]
*  or want to make another tick tock video. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6970.200000000001s)]
*  It's a hard sell. That's a hard sell. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6972.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know. It's a that's an interesting thing in the world of fighting, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6974.0s)]
*  because as the as fighters get older, they they have more experience, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6977.160000000001s)]
*  more understanding, more toughness, but the body doesn't work right anymore. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6981.96s)]
*  That's tough. And that's it right there. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6985.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's a privilege to be getting old. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6987.4800000000005s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6989.320000000001s)]
*  Especially if you spend some time in a. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6990.0s)]
*  But it's funny, I think nature nature balances it out. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6991.56s)]
*  Yeah. You know, yeah, we had we had cowboy come in the show. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6994.56s)]
*  He did. He had a cameo. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6997.56s)]
*  He had a cameo. Chris Pratt got to put a tomahawk in his head. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=6998.72s)]
*  And that was awesome. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7001.4s)]
*  He flew in for the day, did that was awesome. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7003.28s)]
*  We had a great time doing that. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7005.56s)]
*  We got to go out to spend time with him also on the range out at Sig free. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7006.56s)]
*  Not sick freedom days, but they have this sniper course they do in Utah [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7009.96s)]
*  the last couple of years and we got to spend some time together out there. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7013.2s)]
*  And what a good dude. He was he was awesome. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7015.68s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7017.92s)]
*  And he and cowboy insisted on falling a very specific way. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7018.64s)]
*  Yeah. He would know stuntman. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7023.72s)]
*  No makeup either. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7025.08s)]
*  Cowboy doesn't put on makeup. Good for him. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7026.320000000001s)]
*  Exactly. None of this, you know, going in and putting the stuff. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7028.08s)]
*  No. And they're like, well, we have to have a double fall for you. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7030.360000000001s)]
*  Nope. Nope. He's doing it all. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7033.400000000001s)]
*  And you're like, who are you going to argue with him? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7034.76s)]
*  No. Are you going to put the makeup person going to like, no, I have to do this. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7036.160000000001s)]
*  Nope. They just back right off. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7039.240000000001s)]
*  So he was fun to spend some time with both in Utah with Sig and then on the set. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7040.92s)]
*  So it's really cool to have a couple of touch points with him over the last year. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7045.200000000001s)]
*  Again, that's a guy who's overcome a lot of fucking adversity. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7048.36s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and that's why he's got that character. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7051.48s)]
*  There it is. Don't. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7053.96s)]
*  There it is. Bam. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7056.32s)]
*  Yeah. See, there's no that floor isn't padded. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7058.32s)]
*  That floor is not padded right there. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7061.48s)]
*  This is the bang his head. Yeah. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7062.839999999999s)]
*  I was worried. Not concerned. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7064.839999999999s)]
*  No. Zero concerns about banging his head. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7066.5199999999995s)]
*  That dude, he's one of the wildest guys I've ever met because the shit [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7069.5199999999995s)]
*  that he does outside of fighting, which is wild, like they're always trying [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7073.08s)]
*  to get him to calm down because he's always doing things like jumping [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7076.8s)]
*  jet skis and snowmobiles. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7080.320000000001s)]
*  And just just doing so much wild shit outside of fighting, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7083.320000000001s)]
*  which is the wildest fucking thing you could do as a sport. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7089.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7092.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, remember back in the day when Point Break came out and Patrick Swayze [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7093.52s)]
*  was jumping every weekend, like actually jumping out of planes. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7096.6s)]
*  And they were trying to the insurance, like trying to get him to not do that. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7098.8s)]
*  Oh, were they? Yeah. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7101.88s)]
*  So I remember that story from back back in the day. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7102.72s)]
*  And then what do we just see? Mission Impossible. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7104.64s)]
*  Whatever number it's coming up now, Tom Cruise doing that jump and broke his ankle. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7106.48s)]
*  Oh, did he? Yeah. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7110.36s)]
*  Well, he jumped off that on that bike off that cliff like a number of times. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7111.32s)]
*  That was one take. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7115.36s)]
*  That was an incredible. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7116.44s)]
*  Those videos out there that show him training for it and then doing it. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7118.12s)]
*  And how old is he? 60. Crazy. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7120.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. He jumped from one building to the next and shattered his ankle. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7123.32s)]
*  When he made impact, there's a video of his ankle crumbling as it hits the wall. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7127.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And then he's like, well, for the next one, we got to up it. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7132.719999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to take this motorcycle and jump off this cliff. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7135.36s)]
*  And like, was it Norway or something like that? [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7137.8s)]
*  But insane. I mean, amazing. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7139.32s)]
*  He's out of his fucking mind. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7141.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You're not jumping out of planes, right? [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7143.76s)]
*  No. Yeah. You don't do that. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7145.5599999999995s)]
*  And no surfing. No. Yeah. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7146.639999999999s)]
*  I'm fuck sharks. Yeah. Exactly. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7148.44s)]
*  I'm not interested in sharks. Yeah. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7150.2s)]
*  I was reading this story about that woman, Bethany. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7151.12s)]
*  I forget her last name. Hamilton. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7153.92s)]
*  Yeah. She got her arm bitten off by a shark and got right back in there. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7155.08s)]
*  Like, OK. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7158.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7160.8s)]
*  So my little guy, our nice little guy, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7161.8s)]
*  but he's awesome and he's 12 and he hadn't been to Pearl Harbor yet. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7164.32s)]
*  My daughter has. So we took him for his spring break. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7167.96s)]
*  We took him out to to Oahu and went to Pearl Harbor. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7170.0s)]
*  And so we got to go to the Arizona Memorial and then USS Missouri [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7172.84s)]
*  and then up to Punchbowl National Cemetery up there. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7176.16s)]
*  But we got there and he's surfing out there. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7179.08s)]
*  We went with a family that really knows what they're doing surfing. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7181.32s)]
*  And so we did that. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7183.5599999999995s)]
*  And then we went on a shark dive at age 12. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7185.08s)]
*  So we're going out there with these three. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7189.0s)]
*  And now that I'm the age that I am, these people are very young. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7190.48s)]
*  That are taking us out there that are the shark experts. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7194.32s)]
*  And we go out there and in a boat and off you go. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7196.32s)]
*  And they have a photographer there who's studying sharks at the University of Hawaii. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7199.92s)]
*  And then you get the shark expert also studying sharks at the University of Hawaii. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7203.16s)]
*  But they're like 21, maybe. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7206.639999999999s)]
*  And and we zip down there and they're looking to make sure there's no tiger sharks. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7209.04s)]
*  And we go in and we do this dive and our little guys, it's just snorkeling. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7212.84s)]
*  We dive down and they get the picture and you're seeing these sharks [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7216.84s)]
*  and you learn a little bit about them. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7219.0s)]
*  And then we get back. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7220.599999999999s)]
*  And the same day we find out that on Oahu, somebody got chomped. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7221.52s)]
*  So it was just about a month and a half ago. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7225.68s)]
*  And some girl diving somewhere, not in Hawaii, but like in the Maldives [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7227.4800000000005s)]
*  or somewhere like that, also got chomped doing the exact same kind of snorkeling [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7230.8s)]
*  thing that a little guy was doing. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7235.280000000001s)]
*  But I like how you say, you know, if you're not going into the water like that, [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7236.4400000000005s)]
*  then you're not going to get eaten by a shark. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7239.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, it's like it's just kind of like if you don't jump out of the plane, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7241.4800000000005s)]
*  like then you're not going to burn in. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7244.72s)]
*  And I like the jumping like in the military. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7246.400000000001s)]
*  I liked jumping out. I like flying. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7248.040000000001s)]
*  I shouldn't say I like jumping. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7250.0s)]
*  I did not like going to the exit because that's when you're like, OK, here we go. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7250.8s)]
*  You jump out, whether it's dark and you got all your stuff on or whatever it might be. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7254.04s)]
*  But I like the flying around. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7257.56s)]
*  So the flying around was very cool and free fall. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7258.76s)]
*  I saw a video recently of a guy who jumped out of a plane [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7260.72s)]
*  and forgot his parachute. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7263.64s)]
*  Oh, that's experience jumper to see that. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7265.88s)]
*  He's filming it. No. Yeah. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7269.64s)]
*  He's filming it. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7271.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7271.8s)]
*  He filmed other people and forgot to put his suit on. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7272.0s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7274.6s)]
*  Like in the 90s, I think. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7275.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7276.64s)]
*  Wow. Well, we have a couple of things in place [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7278.68s)]
*  in the military that at least would, you know, prevent that, I think. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7280.36s)]
*  So you have a jump masters, then they're checking all your stuff [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7283.16s)]
*  and making sure you're good. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7285.28s)]
*  But the flying around is pretty cool. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7286.4s)]
*  The pulling not so much because then you come for me anyway. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7287.839999999999s)]
*  Look, guys love it. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7290.16s)]
*  But for me, when it came time to pull, I was like, OK, here it is. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7290.759999999999s)]
*  This is either going to open or it's not. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7294.16s)]
*  And if it doesn't, then I have procedures I need to go through. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7295.44s)]
*  I got to remember those and all that stuff. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7297.96s)]
*  And in my free fall class, two people died. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7299.88s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7302.28s)]
*  The student and instructor ran into each other like, oh, boy. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7303.16s)]
*  And they just destroyed it. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7306.639999999999s)]
*  Just. Yeah. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7307.5599999999995s)]
*  We had one more jump to go. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7308.68s)]
*  So we spent hours combing the desert, looking for the bodies. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7309.76s)]
*  And we still had to get back and jump again after that. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7312.76s)]
*  So that was interesting. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7316.240000000001s)]
*  And then a buddy of mine burned in. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7317.76s)]
*  Amazing guy. Such a great guy. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7319.280000000001s)]
*  Mike Bearden, just a such a solid dude. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7320.64s)]
*  Went through buds with him. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7323.52s)]
*  And then he burned in right before they sent me to free fall. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7324.400000000001s)]
*  So when you say burned in mouth, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7327.0s)]
*  powerful malfunction and then died. Yeah. Hit the ground. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7329.400000000001s)]
*  But amazing guy. Such a cool person. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7332.64s)]
*  Just a solid human being. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7336.84s)]
*  And then so like the next week, they sent me like another guy [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7338.4800000000005s)]
*  who were his best friends to the jump school. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7341.4400000000005s)]
*  So that was interesting. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7343.2s)]
*  But and then have two people die in your class. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7344.84s)]
*  Have to do the investigation. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7347.360000000001s)]
*  So then you're sitting there on base waiting for this investigation [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7348.360000000001s)]
*  to be done for like a week, week and a half. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7350.56s)]
*  And then you do your final final jump. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7352.04s)]
*  So, you know, it's not without its risks. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7353.68s)]
*  It's definitely I think that's part of the excitement about it. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7356.96s)]
*  Maybe that's why I ask Andy about it. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7359.8s)]
*  You know, he's not doing I don't think he's doing it too much anymore. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7361.16s)]
*  Andy Stompfos. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7362.68s)]
*  Andy's out of his fucking mind. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7363.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think he's done for a while, though. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7365.24s)]
*  I don't think it's been a little bit since I've seen him do a base jump. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7367.48s)]
*  I don't do it. He's just doing them. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7369.96s)]
*  Was he doing? He's jumping out of planes. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7371.5599999999995s)]
*  I jumped out of planes. Yeah. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7372.96s)]
*  Maybe not the base jumping. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7374.84s)]
*  Maybe it's been the base jumping that's been on pause for a little bit. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7376.16s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7378.44s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7379.12s)]
*  Maybe concentrate on the coffee shop. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7380.12s)]
*  Maybe not so much on the. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7381.639999999999s)]
*  I know he's out of his fucking mind. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7383.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. But it's man. Yeah. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7385.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like a rough way to go. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7387.719999999999s)]
*  That's tough. I mean, he's doing the flying squirrel suit shit, too. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7390.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7393.24s)]
*  It's like Trevor Thompson, those guys who's been on here. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7393.8s)]
*  Like, is this what is this one? Is this Andy? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7395.76s)]
*  Look at him go. Yeah, they just jumped over. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7398.6s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that. Look at this. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7400.56s)]
*  It's amazing. That is wild. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7401.6s)]
*  Yeah. Look at it. And the photos they got from this. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7403.16s)]
*  Crazy. Seven jumps, seven days, seven continents to raise money for Folds of Honor. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7405.2s)]
*  And look at that. That. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7410.2s)]
*  Look how bizarre the pyramids look in juxtaposition to Cairo. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7412.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7416.72s)]
*  I was there years ago. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7418.320000000001s)]
*  And that's that one right there in the right far right. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7419.12s)]
*  I climbed to the top of that one. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7420.72s)]
*  And a long, long time ago, when it was all dark outside, I bribed some guards. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7422.32s)]
*  They took got some horses and rode out to that thing in the middle of the night, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7427.28s)]
*  climbed up to the top and then watched the sunrise over Cairo. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7430.12s)]
*  I got to get out there. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7433.12s)]
*  I still have never been. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7434.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a really cool place. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7436.28s)]
*  And the same thing Taj Mahal. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7437.92s)]
*  Also, I went to the Taj Mahal years ago and you think it's kind of gotty. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7438.96s)]
*  And you get there. It is beautiful. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7441.759999999999s)]
*  It is just incredible to see some of these places. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7443.599999999999s)]
*  I'm just so fascinated by the pyramids. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7446.92s)]
*  Yeah. How they made them. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7448.92s)]
*  Yeah. And also this just these insanely complex cultures that vanish. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7450.08s)]
*  They just do they go away. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7456.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Like what happened? Right. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7457.84s)]
*  What is that? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7459.64s)]
*  And then this is the thing I think about when I think about America today, [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7460.44s)]
*  that every empire collapses. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7464.48s)]
*  And one of the things that Douglas Murray has talked about, [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7467.24s)]
*  it's really fascinating to me. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7470.24s)]
*  He said every society, when it's at the verge of collapse, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7472.68s)]
*  becomes obsessed with gender. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7476.48s)]
*  I've seen that. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7478.44s)]
*  Which is real weird and not good for us, because if there's any fucked society. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7479.879999999999s)]
*  Seems like we're overly focused on some of these things right now. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7484.32s)]
*  Yeah. And so if you're let's say you're Iran, you're Russia, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7487.0s)]
*  you're China, you're North Korea. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7490.2s)]
*  Look at these fuckers. They're going down. Exactly. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7491.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Super empowered individual. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7493.639999999999s)]
*  You're a terrorist organization. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7495.08s)]
*  You might just want to lay back a little bit and watch [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7496.16s)]
*  because we're doing a pretty good job of destroying ourselves from the inside. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7498.44s)]
*  And I'm sure they're helping. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7500.919999999999s)]
*  I'm sure they're helping. Give it a nudge. Social media. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7502.12s)]
*  I'm sure there's like, I mean, [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7504.12s)]
*  one of the things they found out on Facebook was that 19 of the top [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7506.04s)]
*  Christian sites were run by Russian troll farms. Really? [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7509.48s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7512.64s)]
*  Well, 19 of the top 20. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7514.16s)]
*  And they're just saying wild shit and trying to start a holy war. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7516.56s)]
*  Just trying to divide. Oh, my gosh. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7519.96s)]
*  And then we get like, OK, so we have aliens. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7522.2s)]
*  We have some spaceships in here. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7523.88s)]
*  I mean, in the news, imagine that coming out in 1985. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7525.88s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know what to think about that. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7529.4s)]
*  I go back and forth and back and forth. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7531.16s)]
*  You know, part of me thinks some of it is real. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7533.4s)]
*  And part of me thinks a good percentage of is probably like some black project [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7535.88s)]
*  that they're not telling us about, that there's some insanely complex drone [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7541.240000000001s)]
*  and unmanned drone that has capabilities beyond what we think of. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7545.160000000001s)]
*  Right. In terms of, you know, conventional propulsion systems. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7549.88s)]
*  Right. Certainly a possibility. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7553.240000000001s)]
*  A lot of those sightings were, in fact, the black helicopters. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7554.64s)]
*  They're black helicopters, but they're training for overseas. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7558.360000000001s)]
*  And they just have to go to these cities every now and again. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7561.04s)]
*  Or stealth bombers. The beautiful thing. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7563.0s)]
*  Back in the day. Yeah, back in the day. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7564.76s)]
*  Remember, there was a model of it. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7566.0s)]
*  I remember a mar. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7567.360000000001s)]
*  I forget the model anyway. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7568.6s)]
*  I built some old World War II planes back in the day. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7569.6s)]
*  And I always see this stealth bomber that was like a [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7571.8s)]
*  interpretation from the toy company that made these models of a stealth bomber. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7574.4400000000005s)]
*  And it was pretty dang close when they actually revealed it years later. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7578.6s)]
*  So I distinctly remember that. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7582.320000000001s)]
*  But do you have a guy that is it a Navy pilot commander? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7584.8s)]
*  Fravor? OK. Do you have him? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7588.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think. Yeah. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7589.04s)]
*  But two guys, Ryan Graves and Commander Fravor, both of them are fascinating. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7590.280000000001s)]
*  Commander Fravor was the one that off the coast of San Diego in 2004, [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7594.32s)]
*  he encountered that that object that went from more than [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7598.84s)]
*  50,000 feet above sea level to 50 in less than a second. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7602.64s)]
*  Yeah. They have no idea what it did. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7607.12s)]
*  They it was blocking the tracking systems. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7608.92s)]
*  They got visual. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7611.84s)]
*  I they they they saw it visually. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7613.72s)]
*  They have footage of it. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7616.84s)]
*  They have video footage of it. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7618.2s)]
*  Multiple jets encountered this thing. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7619.48s)]
*  And when it zipped off at insane rates of speed, it returned to their cat point. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7621.92s)]
*  So the place where they were supposed to go meet up later, it went there. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7626.360000000001s)]
*  Like, I know where you going, bitch. Wild. Yeah. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7629.68s)]
*  They don't know what it is. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7632.280000000001s)]
*  They don't know where they think there was something else that was under the water [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7633.320000000001s)]
*  that it was interacting with something that was under the water [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7637.240000000001s)]
*  because there was ripples like there was like almost like a submarine. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7640.4400000000005s)]
*  So whatever that thing was that that they encountered, that sort of [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7644.08s)]
*  that man, Commander Fravor, who is so rock solid. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7649.240000000001s)]
*  When you talk to him, he's not a loon in any shape or just a fucking [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7653.280000000001s)]
*  dedicated, lifelong pilot military man who's just [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7657.84s)]
*  he's his credentials are impeccable. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7664.0s)]
*  And when he talks about it, it's it's pretty stunning. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7666.4800000000005s)]
*  And also the attitude that a lot of the higher ups had, like they were aware of it [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7668.88s)]
*  and that they talked to people on the Nimitz and they were saying, yeah, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7673.52s)]
*  we see these things every couple of weeks. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7676.400000000001s)]
*  And they classed those guys say that some of the things they saw were classified. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7678.4s)]
*  They really. Yeah. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7681.719999999999s)]
*  And then there was Ryan Graves, who said that I believe it was in 2014. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7683.36s)]
*  They upgraded all of their equipment and then they started seeing these things [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7687.44s)]
*  because the equipment have new capabilities and they're seeing these things [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7691.0s)]
*  that are 120 knot winds, completely motionless, just staying [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7693.679999999999s)]
*  and just totally still, which is like how? [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7698.16s)]
*  No, no heat signature, no visual means of propulsion. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7701.16s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck these things were doing. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7705.28s)]
*  Moving and insane rates of speed occasionally shadowing them. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7707.44s)]
*  They try to find them. They try to catch up and they take off. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7711.799999999999s)]
*  They couldn't keep up with them. They don't know what they are. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7714.759999999999s)]
*  There was a crazy something that was a cube inside a sphere. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7717.08s)]
*  Did those guys write books or did they forget they did write? [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7721.4s)]
*  One of them read a book about it. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7723.759999999999s)]
*  I know. Oh, no. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7724.719999999999s)]
*  For now, those guys are read a book. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7726.0s)]
*  But Commander Fravor, I first saw him on Lex Friedman's podcast, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7727.5599999999995s)]
*  and then I had him on mine to talk to him about it. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7730.799999999999s)]
*  But it's it is a fascinating encounter. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7733.2s)]
*  Where did you get into the UFOs and all that sort of thing? [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7735.72s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. I think since I was a kid. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7738.68s)]
*  It's just fun, you know, just because I think it's interesting. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7741.16s)]
*  Yeah. I got obsessed with the Roswell crash and then, you know, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7743.6s)]
*  reading all these different books about it. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7747.8s)]
*  And but it wasn't until talking to people that have had experiences [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7749.84s)]
*  that really burns in your head, right, because you're talking to these. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7753.92s)]
*  You can kind of get a sense of people are bullshit artists. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7756.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, you kind of get a sense. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7759.84s)]
*  The Bob Lazar ones, the most bizarre Bob Lazar is the gentleman [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7760.92s)]
*  that worked on area S4 site for Area 51. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7764.88s)]
*  He worked back engineering with this thing that they said that they had recovered. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7769.76s)]
*  And they were trying to figure out how the propulsion system worked. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7775.08s)]
*  And they brought him on. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7779.400000000001s)]
*  And they don't tell him what these things are, what it is like. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7780.68s)]
*  He tells how this works. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7783.52s)]
*  And he's in this thing that's designed for something that's three feet tall. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7785.24s)]
*  These these completely smooth surfaces, this metal that they don't understand. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7790.0s)]
*  They this visual really the metal, the actual thing. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7794.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just like in the movies. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7797.12s)]
*  We're like, we don't have any evidence of this ever existing. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7798.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what the fuck it is. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7800.799999999999s)]
*  They there was different. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7802.2s)]
*  He said the problem with it is that these science doesn't exist in a vacuum. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7804.639999999999s)]
*  You need a bunch of scientists comparing notes and trying to discuss it. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7809.639999999999s)]
*  But everything was top secret and classified, so they couldn't do that. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7812.92s)]
*  So they brought in people who the metallurgy people and they and they were not [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7816.44s)]
*  allowed to communicate with the people that were the propulsion experts. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7819.92s)]
*  They were not allowed to communicate with people who supposedly had [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7823.2s)]
*  some sort of contact with the biological entities. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7828.28s)]
*  And then there's this amazing [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7832.4s)]
*  documentary that was just released recently called Moment of Contact [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7833.76s)]
*  about Virginia, Brazil in 1996. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7837.8s)]
*  There was a crash and not only was a crash, but there's a crash in these bodies. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7840.36s)]
*  Yeah, one of them was alive and injured. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7846.04s)]
*  This soldier picked this thing up. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7849.16s)]
*  They carry this thing to multiple different hospitals. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7851.04s)]
*  They did autopsies on this thing. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7853.96s)]
*  And then the soldier who encountered it died of a horrific bacterial [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7856.36s)]
*  infection that they could not describe. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7861.44s)]
*  They didn't know what it was. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7863.68s)]
*  They didn't know how he got it. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7865.08s)]
*  And he got it from being in contact with this entity. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7866.32s)]
*  Supposedly. What? Oh, my God. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7868.6s)]
*  The moment of contact. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7870.24s)]
*  Moment of contact. It's incredible. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7872.32s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7874.48s)]
*  What's incredible, too, is this one of these guys, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7875.68s)]
*  one of the soldiers that was in this documentary, [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7878.4s)]
*  they bring him to the crash site and this guy starts weeping and he's talking about it. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7881.4s)]
*  I mean, unless this guy is like the greatest fucking actor the world's ever known. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7885.96s)]
*  The way he reacts when he sees this site, when he describes his experience, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7889.44s)]
*  when they found this thing that it crash landed. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7893.8s)]
*  And there's also documentation that the Air Force had flown a jet to Virginia [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7896.44s)]
*  and returned with whatever the fuck they caught, whatever they got there [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7901.4s)]
*  and brought it back to the United States. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7905.8s)]
*  That is wild. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7907.96s)]
*  You know, Jackie Gleason supposedly had an encounter with Nixon, [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7909.36s)]
*  that Nixon and Gleason were buddies and they were drinking. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7913.08s)]
*  And yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7915.36s)]
*  It's a famous story that's disputed, but apparently let's go with it, though. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7916.36s)]
*  Yeah, let's go with it. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7920.36s)]
*  Gleason apparently had said [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7921.44s)]
*  that Jackie Gleason and him were drinking and and Nixon was like, [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7924.28s)]
*  you want to see a fucking UFO? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7928.4800000000005s)]
*  No way. Yeah. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7930.84s)]
*  And he flew him to see wreckage. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7931.92s)]
*  And they had frozen biological entities [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7935.36s)]
*  and they got a chance to see these things that they had that they had frozen. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7939.08s)]
*  What? Yeah. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7945.0s)]
*  What? Yeah. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7946.639999999999s)]
*  So that must have been like early 70s. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7947.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7949.32s)]
*  And Jackie Gleason wound up having a house built in the shape of a UFO afterwards. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7950.599999999999s)]
*  No way. Yeah. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7955.48s)]
*  That was for sale as recently as I think like a decade ago. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7956.679999999999s)]
*  See if you can find that house in L.A. or something. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7960.639999999999s)]
*  No, it's in upstate New York. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7962.24s)]
*  But the house looks like a fucking UFO. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7964.2s)]
*  No. He had a UFO house built. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7965.92s)]
*  Yeah, Jackie Gleason apparently was obsessed with UFOs after the fact. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7968.92s)]
*  No. What? Yeah. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7972.48s)]
*  Jackie Gleason's UFO and starred upstate. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7974.32s)]
*  Yeah. Upstate New York spaceship house. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7976.639999999999s)]
*  No way. Yeah. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7978.76s)]
*  That was his home. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7980.5199999999995s)]
*  And that picture makes it look bigger. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7981.72s)]
*  OK, that's serious. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7982.96s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, wow. That's beautiful. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7984.4s)]
*  That's two different buildings. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7986.32s)]
*  Oh, they have his mortar. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7987.84s)]
*  Like the guest house. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7988.84s)]
*  Oh, I see. Small building. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7990.24s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7991.84s)]
*  That's the guest house. The other one. Wild. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7992.68s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7994.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So Jackie Gleason became a UFO freak. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7995.400000000001s)]
*  Man, I'm going to do that after this. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7997.96s)]
*  That's a pretty cool looking house. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=7999.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty dope. Oh, my God. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8000.4800000000005s)]
*  Wow, look at that. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8002.08s)]
*  Wonder if it's still for sale. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8002.96s)]
*  That's an entrance to the mothership. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8004.04s)]
*  Whoo. I talked to my wife about this. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8005.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. This is serious right here. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8006.92s)]
*  Well, now you have this SIG spear. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8009.4800000000005s)]
*  So there's a lot of UFO stuff on this SIG spear. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8011.400000000001s)]
*  So maybe this should be reserved for taking out the aliens when they come. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8013.64s)]
*  I don't want to take them out. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8018.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, if they attack you. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8019.64s)]
*  If they attack. If they attack. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8020.92s)]
*  If they do attack, I think they could render you useless almost instantaneously. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8022.8s)]
*  But then too, they're kind of like, why wouldn't they just sit back and watch? [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8027.08s)]
*  I think they're... [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8030.4800000000005s)]
*  They're going to pass right by. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8032.12s)]
*  If I had to guess, if I had to guess, I mean, just the wildest of speculations, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8033.04s)]
*  I would guess that every civilization reaches a point of technological proficiency [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8037.08s)]
*  when they're also dealing with these territorial warring tribes [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8043.64s)]
*  where they have the ability to literally destroy the earth. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8049.08s)]
*  And that if this is a natural course of progression for intelligent beings, [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8052.08s)]
*  they get to this point, there's a transition where it gets very dangerous. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8056.44s)]
*  And if I was from another planet and I was monitoring this, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8060.88s)]
*  I would be there to make sure that they don't launch. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8063.88s)]
*  And that's the theme of the mothership comedy club, [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8067.88s)]
*  is that the rooms are called Fat Man and Little Boy. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8072.08s)]
*  And the reason why the rooms are called Fat Man and Little Boy [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8075.24s)]
*  is because that is a specific moment in UFO folklore when the aliens start arriving. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8077.76s)]
*  After the detonation of those bombs, that's when you start seeing this massive uptick in sightings. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8083.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8088.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8088.92s)]
*  And interactions with fighter pilots and these different military bases [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8089.400000000001s)]
*  that have nuclear programs where the bases get shut down and all the power goes off. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8096.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's like... [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8101.76s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8102.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's heavy stuff. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8104.2s)]
*  Because if you think that they are watching, that would make the most sense. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8106.36s)]
*  That they see that we have nuclear power, we have the ability to blow ourselves up, [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8111.32s)]
*  and we detonate two bombs. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8115.24s)]
*  And then they're like, OK, let's go monitor these assholes. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8117.719999999999s)]
*  Let's go make sure that's what's going to affect the rest of the universe. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8122.32s)]
*  One country right now has them. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8125.04s)]
*  Let's fucking specifically concentrate on them. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8126.759999999999s)]
*  And then they have sightings in the Soviet Union, [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8129.719999999999s)]
*  and the Soviet Union has the capabilities. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8131.5599999999995s)]
*  No kidding. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8133.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's a ton of documented sightings and these encounters that happen. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8134.32s)]
*  So beforehand, there's not really anything? [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8139.5199999999995s)]
*  Very little. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8141.4s)]
*  Very little. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8142.16s)]
*  Well, I'm sure they've probably been visiting us. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8143.28s)]
*  If they do visit us, I would imagine they've been visiting us forever. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8145.4s)]
*  Like, look, they've got engines. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8148.96s)]
*  Look, they've got guns. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8150.16s)]
*  Look, they've got this. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8151.12s)]
*  You know, it'd be fascinating to watch. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8152.32s)]
*  Like, look at these territorial apes with nuclear weapons. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8153.92s)]
*  Like, that's the time to watch. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8156.96s)]
*  Right now, they're probably just sitting back, popping that popcorn and being like, [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8159.28s)]
*  oh, man, it's getting interesting now. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8162.32s)]
*  We're getting closer and closer to our fucking inevitable demise. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8164.28s)]
*  Like, that's when the sightings are ramped up to the point where the Pentagon has to [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8168.4s)]
*  start talking about it. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8172.04s)]
*  And they are. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8172.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8173.48s)]
*  In front of Congress. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8173.96s)]
*  Yes. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8174.84s)]
*  I mean, that's wild. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8175.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8176.48s)]
*  But no one pays attention. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8176.88s)]
*  No, no one pays attention. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8177.84s)]
*  It's like, let's go back to TikTok and Instagram. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8178.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, they kind of pay attention, but it's not, [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8180.84s)]
*  there's nothing that you could fucking put your fork into. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8183.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8185.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like, what is it? [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8185.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8186.84s)]
*  And why are they telling us about this? [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8187.48s)]
*  Also, there's a lot of cynicism when it comes to like, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8190.96s)]
*  why is the government telling us about UFOs? [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8193.44s)]
*  Like a distraction, you mean? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8195.640000000001s)]
*  Well, what is it? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8196.640000000001s)]
*  Are they telling us because they really have this information [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8198.08s)]
*  and they want to slowly leak it out because this is an inevitable contact moment [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8201.32s)]
*  and they want to prepare civilization? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8206.28s)]
*  Or is it just horseshit? [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8209.08s)]
*  Is it just they're distracting us and this is how they institute this drone program [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8210.68s)]
*  where they have this anti-gravity device and they can move in the same rates of speed? [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8215.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8220.84s)]
*  I mean, it's just guesswork. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8221.4s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8223.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8223.880000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8224.76s)]
*  You could hear directly from these guys who've actually seen it, experienced it. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8225.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8228.720000000001s)]
*  Talk with them for a little bit. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8229.48s)]
*  I've talked to quite a few now, quite a few that have seen these things and had these experiences. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8230.48s)]
*  But the Bob Lazar one is uniquely compelling. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8235.56s)]
*  Uniquely compelling because Bob is without a doubt a brilliant guy. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8239.16s)]
*  And he was a legitimate propulsions expert who it's been proven he worked at Los Alamos Labs. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8242.76s)]
*  And they tried to hide that. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8248.56s)]
*  They tried to lie about that and say that he wasn't, but he's on the employee roster. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8249.720000000001s)]
*  He has an intimate knowledge of the facilities. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8253.720000000001s)]
*  They took him, George Knapp took him on a tour of Los Alamos. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8257.36s)]
*  He knew where everything was. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8260.12s)]
*  He knew the people there. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8261.6s)]
*  They knew him. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8262.64s)]
*  Wow. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8263.48s)]
*  It's wild shit, man, because if he's telling the truth, he says it's not one that they've recovered, [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8264.0s)]
*  but multiple, and that one of them they think is really old and they got it from an archaeological dig. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8268.84s)]
*  They think that they've recovered this thing in the ground. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8274.32s)]
*  That's movie stuff. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8277.44s)]
*  When you see that in movies and we all watch it in movies and think it's science fiction, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8278.2s)]
*  but there's a lot of science fiction that has come to fruition. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8282.16s)]
*  From submarines to going to the moon to Los Alamos, space travel in general, flight, just flying. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8285.52s)]
*  Sure, all of it. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8291.240000000002s)]
*  And we're just like, no big deal. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8292.480000000001s)]
*  But I remember we got back to Coronado, which is one of the seal hubs, Virginia Beach is the other. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8295.52s)]
*  We're in Virginia Beach, went back there. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8301.400000000001s)]
*  And I think you did a bit on flight when internet first became available on a flight. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8303.28s)]
*  And you're like, people first time, a Southwest flight, whatever it was. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8311.32s)]
*  Hey, we have internet for the first time on this flight. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8316.36s)]
*  And here's the password for your internet thing. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8319.76s)]
*  And a guy opens it up and whatever and opens it up and it doesn't work for a second. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8323.119999999999s)]
*  He slams it down. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8327.72s)]
*  Oh, that's Louis C.K. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8328.56s)]
*  Oh, is it? [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8329.56s)]
*  Louis C.K. had a joke about that. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8330.08s)]
*  Fucking piece of shit. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8331.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8332.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8333.12s)]
*  He's flying through the air. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8334.12s)]
*  Yeah, literally. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8335.6s)]
*  Like, you look around and be thankful. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8336.6s)]
*  You get internet from space. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8338.6s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8339.6s)]
*  But instead you're like, ah, it doesn't work. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8340.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8343.240000000002s)]
*  What the hell is going on here? [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8343.76s)]
*  That's people that haven't had to develop those things that don't appreciate them. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8344.76s)]
*  I mean, how many people get mad their Wi-Fi cuts out in their phone? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8349.320000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8351.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's just... [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8352.960000000001s)]
*  It lies at level of anxiety in your life. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8353.960000000001s)]
*  And you just got to be, you know, I mean, it's tough. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8356.36s)]
*  You got to figure out how to manage that. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8358.04s)]
*  You know, just like these negative comments we were talking about. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8359.36s)]
*  I won't go into the comments on this one. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8361.68s)]
*  I mean, imagine what people are going to say about UFOs and everything else in the comments [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8363.08s)]
*  here. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8367.28s)]
*  I think people that listen to this podcast love UFOs. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8368.28s)]
*  It's just... [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8370.28s)]
*  It's such a fun thing. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8371.28s)]
*  These are the people? [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8372.28s)]
*  These are the people? [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8373.28s)]
*  It's such a fun thing to be excited about. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8374.28s)]
*  I mean, and it might be the thing that could save us from demise if we really are on this [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8375.960000000001s)]
*  path of mutually assured destruction with Russia and with China, with China invading [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8381.560000000001s)]
*  Taiwan, which seems also inevitable. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8386.640000000001s)]
*  It's terrifying, terrifying stuff. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8389.16s)]
*  Also something in the pages of this novel. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8390.96s)]
*  I don't think you've got... [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8392.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you did get there. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8393.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's a sentence about it in the earlier chapter. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8394.599999999999s)]
*  So I try to... [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8397.08s)]
*  Just things that are on my mind work their way into the pages of these things as well. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8398.96s)]
*  So China, Taiwan is in there. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8402.24s)]
*  Ukraine is in there, of course. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8403.68s)]
*  And there's some other things that will be a surprise to people in these pages. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8404.68s)]
*  But for me, it's a great outlet because I get to think all these things that I'm thinking [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8407.88s)]
*  about or worried about or whatever else, I get to weave into these pages and think about [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8410.76s)]
*  them alone with no interruption. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8414.08s)]
*  Well, most of the time, there's some interruptions in our house with three kids, dog and everything [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8415.4s)]
*  else going on. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8419.4s)]
*  But it's fantastic. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8420.48s)]
*  I actually enjoy the interruptions because I know when they're gone, I'll miss them. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8421.48s)]
*  I'll miss them. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8425.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8426.24s)]
*  Well, that's great, your ability to see that. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8427.24s)]
*  Because sometimes it's hard for people when you're in the middle of things to appreciate [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8430.6s)]
*  it. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8434.6s)]
*  Yeah, you're building. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8435.6s)]
*  And you can be solely focused on that task at hand. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8436.6s)]
*  Like in the military, that pendulum has to be on the side of the team because you're [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8438.119999999999s)]
*  taking these guys down range. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8441.4s)]
*  Your life is in their hands. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8442.68s)]
*  So you have to be as prepared as you can possibly be to make the best decisions under fire you [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8444.16s)]
*  possibly can. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8448.720000000001s)]
*  Because that means that pendulum is not on the side of the family over here. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8449.720000000001s)]
*  So they're doing all those other things. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8453.84s)]
*  So you have to have a very supportive family that understands that you're going to Iraq, [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8456.0s)]
*  you're going to Afghanistan. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8459.12s)]
*  Your best friends are in that trench with you to the right and the left. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8460.32s)]
*  And so that pendulum has to be over here. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8462.92s)]
*  You owe that to them, their families, the country, the mission, the team. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8464.92s)]
*  But once you get out and can start building. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8470.16s)]
*  But it's about any business. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8472.6s)]
*  You're building and you're solely focused on it and your family's over here. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8474.0s)]
*  Sometimes that does take a backseat when you're building. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8477.400000000001s)]
*  But for me, I know that I'm going to miss those times. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8480.400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to miss all those interruptions in a few years. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8482.720000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8485.12s)]
*  I mean, I miss my kids are teenagers now, but I miss them when they were little kids. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8486.76s)]
*  It was just the videos you could watch. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8491.560000000001s)]
*  I know. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8493.68s)]
*  Now you can go back on your phone and Apple puts it right there. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8494.08s)]
*  They put those little memories or whatever that pop up and things you've almost forgotten [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8497.24s)]
*  about in a lot of cases pop up on there. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8501.400000000001s)]
*  And I go, oh, and I stop. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8503.32s)]
*  I stop what I'm doing. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8504.640000000001s)]
*  I watch it and then I send it to my wife. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8506.0s)]
*  You know, I said, did you see this? [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8508.44s)]
*  Apple found this memory too, because because of, you know, a lot of people have iPhones [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8509.88s)]
*  and they've had them since 2007 or eight. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8515.6s)]
*  Whenever they came out, like that's a long history of your eye photo that you can pull [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8517.88s)]
*  from and get these wild memories. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8522.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I was born in 2005. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8525.08s)]
*  I got my iPhone in, I don't know, 2007. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8526.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8529.2s)]
*  And so same thing. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8530.08s)]
*  And they get you early. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8531.6s)]
*  Once you're Apple, they like they get you. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8532.44s)]
*  You know, they get everything's in this cloud eventually. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8534.320000000002s)]
*  And then they've got you for life. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8536.800000000001s)]
*  And so the walled garden. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8537.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8539.36s)]
*  So I've got the couple phones now since you recommended that that to me. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8539.68s)]
*  I haven't committed to the other one yet, which I need to do. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8542.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8546.68s)]
*  Because that thing's going off. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8547.16s)]
*  I feel very fortunate. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8548.480000000001s)]
*  Very, very fortunate. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8549.52s)]
*  But I need to commit to that that other number. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8550.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8552.320000000002s)]
*  You got to have a phone that only a few people have. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8552.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8554.76s)]
*  It's I think a certain point in time you want to be able to have a phone. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8555.480000000001s)]
*  You check every now and again. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8558.720000000001s)]
*  But to have a phone where your wife has your best friends have. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8560.480000000001s)]
*  And then don't let anybody give that fucker away. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8563.68s)]
*  Yes. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8565.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8566.24s)]
*  I tell it like if I get a group text and there's a group text with someone. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8566.439999999999s)]
*  Hey, man, this guy wants to talk to you about a project. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8571.439999999999s)]
*  And it's just a number, not a name. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8573.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8574.359999999999s)]
*  I blocked that person. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8574.64s)]
*  I say, all right, well, you're off the fucking list now [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8575.84s)]
*  because you just connected me to some asshole from a tech company. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8578.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8581.32s)]
*  You have to. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8582.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8582.56s)]
*  How are you supposed to live? [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8582.8s)]
*  Maybe not even an asshole. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8583.519999999999s)]
*  Maybe a nice guy. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8584.279999999999s)]
*  But yeah, it's not his fault. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8584.96s)]
*  It's not self-worn enough to realize that's not appropriate. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8586.32s)]
*  Some people don't understand what it's like to like. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8589.0s)]
*  I'll leave a podcast. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8593.12s)]
*  I'll have one hundred and fifty text messages, one hundred and forty text messages. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8594.08s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8598.08s)]
*  Yeah, I've had days where I've had hundreds of text messages. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8599.52s)]
*  Wow. You can't keep up. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8603.28s)]
*  It's not possible. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8604.84s)]
*  No. And some people abuse the shit out of that. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8606.039999999999s)]
*  And hey, man, you fucking you're ignoring me. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8608.2s)]
*  My dude, if you could see the volume of emails and direct messages, [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8610.16s)]
*  it's like, do you want to be a normal human? [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8618.24s)]
*  Because if you want to be a normal human, [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8620.52s)]
*  you cannot keep up with all that. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8621.96s)]
*  It's impossible. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8623.359999999999s)]
*  Especially if you want to be a person that does what I do, perform. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8624.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You want to be funny and do podcasts. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8627.0s)]
*  And I can't be checking that thing all the time. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8630.08s)]
*  You got to create a podcast for hours. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8632.199999999999s)]
*  I'm locked in a conversation. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8634.279999999999s)]
*  We're having one right now. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8635.64s)]
*  Phones not going phones on phones on airplane mode. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8636.599999999999s)]
*  And then I leave. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8638.8s)]
*  I got to have dinner with my family. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8639.96s)]
*  I got shows. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8641.64s)]
*  I got shows, two shows a night sometimes. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8642.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's incredible. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8645.039999999999s)]
*  So now, I mean, it's not nearly at your level, but I certainly see it. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8646.0s)]
*  And I'm going to do that thing where I miss the 80s. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8649.4s)]
*  I mean, if I could go back in time, I'd go back to 85. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8651.76s)]
*  And I would just stay in 85. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8654.12s)]
*  I think, you know, we have Back to the Future comes out. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8656.08s)]
*  Rambo First Blood Part Two comes out. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8658.36s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8660.52s)]
*  I think Fletch is out there. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8661.2s)]
*  Anyway, it's a great year. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8662.08s)]
*  I mean, 85 right in the middle. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8663.2s)]
*  I just stay right there. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8664.48s)]
*  I like it right now. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8665.72s)]
*  And you like it, do you? [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8666.84s)]
*  I like it right now. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8667.84s)]
*  That's awesome. I love it. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8668.68s)]
*  I'm going to try to get to that. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8669.52s)]
*  I'm going to try to get to that sort of an attitude. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8670.24s)]
*  Well, because I think this is the last generation before we can read minds. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8672.84s)]
*  Oh, this is the last generation before we become fully integrated [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8677.36s)]
*  with technology that's actually ingrained, embedded into your body. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8680.6s)]
*  I think we're a decade or so away from cyborgs. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8685.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8689.4s)]
*  None of that was there in 1985 either. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8690.880000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, but I like going back. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8692.44s)]
*  I'm going back. I'm going back. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8693.640000000001s)]
*  I enjoy having a phone. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8695.12s)]
*  I enjoy being able to film things and I enjoy being able to ask Google, [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8696.76s)]
*  like, how far can a turkey fly? [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8701.12s)]
*  And that was important. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8702.84s)]
*  I loved doing that with my kids. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8704.48s)]
*  100 yards for people joining us all the time while we're driving. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8705.76s)]
*  We'll have conversations about stuff like. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8708.76s)]
*  And you're like, check it. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8710.56s)]
*  So let's Google it. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8711.4s)]
*  And then it's really fun. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8712.199999999999s)]
*  It's fun to have that kind of access to information. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8713.48s)]
*  There's negative consequences to every generation that's ever existed. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8716.92s)]
*  There's there's always going to be negatives, but I like it today. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8720.52s)]
*  Man, I love your attitude. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8723.4s)]
*  I'm going to go home and I'm going to think about this while I'm on book tour right now. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8724.52s)]
*  So I'm going to go to my hotel and think about this as I continue on book tour. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8726.96s)]
*  But I'm building a time machine. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8730.32s)]
*  Yeah. And this time machine is about it's about it's almost the size of this room [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8731.68s)]
*  right here. And you walk in and it's VHS tapes. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8736.279999999999s)]
*  It's video discs. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8739.8s)]
*  So video is not no no no no late 70s. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8741.519999999999s)]
*  So it's like a record. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8745.0s)]
*  And so it skips all over the place and you have to put RCA video disc player. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8746.16s)]
*  You put them in with this. It's a square. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8749.519999999999s)]
*  You pull the square out and it leaves the disc in there that's plastic. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8751.4s)]
*  You get to about 35 minutes. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8754.8s)]
*  You got to put it in again. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8756.039999999999s)]
*  Pull it out. Turn it around. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8756.96s)]
*  Put it back in again. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8758.599999999999s)]
*  So it's a precursor to laser disc. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8759.599999999999s)]
*  So I'm kind of where that exists. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8761.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. That's in the 70s. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8763.599999999999s)]
*  Like 79 or something like that. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8765.359999999999s)]
*  People can fact check. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8766.759999999998s)]
*  I won't look at the comments, but it's. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8767.96s)]
*  There it is. And look at that. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8770.4s)]
*  Yep. That's the one RCA spectra vision. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8771.960000000001s)]
*  That's the one we had growing up. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8774.92s)]
*  Look at that. Wow. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8776.48s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8777.800000000001s)]
*  I love how they use fake wood with those. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8778.6s)]
*  Fantastic. Yeah, exactly. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8780.6s)]
*  It is so. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8782.48s)]
*  Well, it's like wood. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8783.24s)]
*  Like Atari, too. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8784.4s)]
*  Or just like like a Wagoneer or like in a vacation. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8785.48s)]
*  You know, they had the wood paneling down the side of the other car. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8789.6s)]
*  But yes, so Tom Cruise. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8792.6s)]
*  And now so I'm going back. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8794.36s)]
*  So my time machine is one of these. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8796.56s)]
*  It's VHS or VCR VHS tapes. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8799.08s)]
*  And you want an Atari 2600, and I'm going to track down the first Nintendo. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8802.8s)]
*  And I'm just going to have those in there. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8806.72s)]
*  And I walk in and now I'm back in 1980. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8808.0s)]
*  That's my time machine. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8811.12s)]
*  I better leave your phone outside. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8812.12s)]
*  Exactly. You know, you know, phones, no phones in that in that thing right there. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8813.48s)]
*  So, yeah, the phone thing and what I'm going to do with my phone [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8817.72s)]
*  with the one that I have now is plug it in and treat it like it's a cord. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8819.64s)]
*  So treat it like it is attached to the wall, like it would have been back in. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8823.48s)]
*  And so I have to go up there to that to a room, not the time machine, [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8827.64s)]
*  but another room where I have to like pick it up right there. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8831.16s)]
*  And it's just attached with the cable to the charger. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8833.56s)]
*  But I would pretend that that is a cord to the wall. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8835.48s)]
*  And so if I want to check those messages, then I have to go up there. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8838.48s)]
*  That's my plan. That's my plan. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8841.68s)]
*  And then the other phone that that will be the one that's on me, [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8843.4s)]
*  that just a few people have, because it's gotten a little crazy. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8846.4s)]
*  But I feel so fortunate at the same time. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8850.04s)]
*  You feel so fortunate, of course. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8851.36s)]
*  Yeah, you're way better off being busy than wishing you were busy. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8852.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, you're way better off. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8857.32s)]
*  I think that you not being able to work out thing scares me [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8859.4s)]
*  because for me, I need it for mental health. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8863.24s)]
*  I have to I have to do some sort of physical exercise, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8865.84s)]
*  just sort of wring out the tension and anxiety in my body. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8869.04s)]
*  And if I don't do that, I go crazy. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8872.12s)]
*  I should I should be doing that. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8873.68s)]
*  And I know I should be doing that. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8875.28s)]
*  But right now, it's shot out of that cannon every morning. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8876.44s)]
*  And it's when it's quiet. It's when everybody's in bed. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8879.0s)]
*  Maybe you can just enforce a certain number of calisthenics [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8881.24s)]
*  you have to do every day. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8883.68s)]
*  I started just getting out of bed and doing some push ups and sit ups [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8884.64s)]
*  and stuff like that. And I did that for like two weeks. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8886.88s)]
*  And then it just went by the wayside for whatever reason. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8888.68s)]
*  But again, you're so fortunate that you're in this position [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8893.32s)]
*  that you have all this stuff going on. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8897.0s)]
*  That's like the dream. The dream was you're living the fucking American dream. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8899.52s)]
*  I mean, you really did it. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8904.24s)]
*  You really did it. And it's actually happening. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8905.32s)]
*  Yeah. And as are you. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8907.32s)]
*  And I mean, you're an inspiration for a ton of people. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8908.2s)]
*  You'll never even know how many people. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8910.16s)]
*  It's impossible to quantify with how many people listen to this [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8912.16s)]
*  and see you and see what you've created and what you've done and we've built. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8914.24s)]
*  And that's on a scale that's not close to what I'm doing. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8917.56s)]
*  But it's been busy every single second of my life, just like just like you. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8921.0s)]
*  And I didn't even look at it as building, just like you just doing. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8924.96s)]
*  Yeah. And just doing. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8928.08s)]
*  Yeah. And if you recognize that that you just have this one shot at it, [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8929.68s)]
*  like, why not go all in? [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8933.24s)]
*  Why not go all in? Yeah. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8934.72s)]
*  It's just you don't get a lot of opportunities. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8936.56s)]
*  And the people that don't go all in, [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8939.44s)]
*  I think they're always going to have some sort of a regret. Yeah. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8941.52s)]
*  I think I mean, but everybody's different. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8944.640000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of people out there that like have that opportunity. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8946.480000000001s)]
*  Like, you know what? I'd rather live a simple life. Yeah. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8948.960000000001s)]
*  And there's that's great, too. That's great. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8950.6s)]
*  That's your thing. Yeah. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8951.960000000001s)]
*  Everybody has it. That's what's great about America is you get to choose. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8953.52s)]
*  Yeah. Most everywhere else in the world, you don't. Right. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8956.12s)]
*  So I think a lot of people forget that here. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8959.04s)]
*  Then no matter where you come from, no matter where you start, it's up to you. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8960.960000000001s)]
*  You have opportunity here. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8964.2s)]
*  You're not forced into doing what your father did or whatever else. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8965.880000000001s)]
*  You're not forced into that because of tradition and socioeconomic status [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8969.12s)]
*  and the country that doesn't give you these opportunities. Yeah. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8972.68s)]
*  But we have that here. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8975.880000000001s)]
*  We do recognize that and then realize that you've got this one shot. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8977.04s)]
*  Like you got you won the lottery. Yeah. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8981.2s)]
*  Like I feel like I won the lottery being born here, not having my buddy [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8984.08s)]
*  give the book to Chris Pratt or having somebody give the book to Simon [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8987.800000000001s)]
*  and Schuster or whatever it was. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8990.240000000002s)]
*  Being born here is winning that lottery. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8991.6s)]
*  Yeah. And I've always felt that way. That's true. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8993.76s)]
*  That's 100 percent true because people like to compare themselves to other people. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=8996.240000000002s)]
*  Like, oh, they have more opportunities. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9000.960000000001s)]
*  They were set up better. They this, they that. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9002.92s)]
*  But you, if you're listening to this, you live in a rare time. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9004.52s)]
*  This is a rare time. And you're in an amazing place. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9008.68s)]
*  If you're in America in particular, but even if you're in other parts of the world, [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9011.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is a great place to be alive. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9015.0s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of people want to come here for that, just for that, [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9017.92s)]
*  because they don't have it where they are. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9020.6s)]
*  So they do everything they possibly can sacrifice everything to come here. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9021.560000000001s)]
*  So they have that opportunity that we're lucky enough to be born with. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9024.76s)]
*  I think about that when I see the border crisis, when I see the border crisis. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9027.48s)]
*  I'm like, listen, if I was in Guatemala, I would be doing the same shit. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9031.08s)]
*  I'd be sneaking across that border, just like everybody else. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9034.560000000001s)]
*  I guess it's not even sneaking anymore. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9037.12s)]
*  Just walk seems like just walking and they give you a free phone. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9038.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. A buddy of mine from the Border Patrol [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9041.4s)]
*  texted me the other day and he was I sent him one of the books. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9043.04s)]
*  I sent one of these actually in this case right here. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9045.800000000001s)]
*  And he's a Border Patrol agent down there. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9047.68s)]
*  And I sent it to him when he got home from work and he took a picture of it. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9049.36s)]
*  And he said, man, he texted me. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9051.960000000001s)]
*  He's like, man, this was a rough day. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9053.88s)]
*  And this made my day getting this that you still remember. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9055.56s)]
*  Remember me from these, you know, whatever. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9058.439999999999s)]
*  But he said today was horrible. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9060.4s)]
*  And it was right. The Title 42 thing just a few days ago. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9062.759999999998s)]
*  And he talked about people coming across and getting 1500 bucks. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9066.119999999999s)]
*  I think it was. And and and off they go and how they're forced to release [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9069.64s)]
*  and do all these things. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9073.08s)]
*  And their job is to protect. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9074.48s)]
*  Yet they have to let through and they don't know who they're letting through. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9076.119999999999s)]
*  And that's not a perfect screening. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9079.039999999999s)]
*  You're this person that's supposed to protect. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9081.76s)]
*  You're supposed to be on that border, protecting that border. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9083.88s)]
*  You're on that wall. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9086.0s)]
*  That's what you swore your oath to. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9086.88s)]
*  And now you're just opening these gates. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9088.72s)]
*  It's crazy. He was just so demoralized. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9091.24s)]
*  And what the fuck do you think that is? [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9093.08s)]
*  Like, why is that happening? [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9094.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think there's a voter base that a certain segment of society [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9095.92s)]
*  thinks is going to be more apt to vote for one side than the other. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9098.68s)]
*  But but we have I mean, we talk about and people like to make [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9101.64s)]
*  fun of Trump in the wall. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9105.08s)]
*  I mean, there are great memes out there about the wall. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9106.16s)]
*  And then people like to point to places in history. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9108.92s)]
*  Well, walls were meant to keep people in. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9111.32s)]
*  Yeah. Well, no, the walls also work to keep people out. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9113.8s)]
*  And so it's just tough. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9117.96s)]
*  But you also at the same time, as a compassionate person, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9119.96s)]
*  you want to let that person in from Guatemala that worked their way [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9123.0s)]
*  all the way up here and put in that work for a new opportunity [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9126.279999999999s)]
*  for them and their family here. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9129.24s)]
*  And that's going to be probably a productive citizen. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9130.68s)]
*  But along with that person comes other people with various types of ambitions [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9133.64s)]
*  that can also work their way. Of course. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9139.08s)]
*  So it's I mean, it's it's extremely tough, but a country needs borders. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9140.92s)]
*  And that's not a country. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9145.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand how it's this porous. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9146.72s)]
*  I don't understand how is this crazy? [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9149.0s)]
*  Because when you're watching the influx of people from and again, [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9150.56s)]
*  I understand why they would want to do it. Totally. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9153.8s)]
*  But what a fucking terrible mismanagement. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9156.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it's it's the compassion of the American people. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9159.28s)]
*  We're very compassionate, I think, overall. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9162.56s)]
*  And just like when you see somebody who posts a picture of a dead animal [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9164.6s)]
*  and they're so excited, they put in all this work and they got there. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9168.32s)]
*  And they took this picture and they posted it. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9170.84s)]
*  And then they get destroyed online because of these comments or whatever, [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9172.12s)]
*  whatever it might be. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9176.2s)]
*  People that are eating a cheeseburger. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9177.56s)]
*  That happens. That happens as well. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9179.72s)]
*  But but they're doing it. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9181.44s)]
*  It's it's not it can be it can be twisted and it can be turned. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9183.64s)]
*  And then they're putting it up there because they're feeding their family [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9187.72s)]
*  or whatever else. And now it's all these things are very connected [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9190.12s)]
*  because you can exploit and you can twist and you can turn all of them. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9192.72s)]
*  You can weaponize all of it. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9196.12s)]
*  And Internet and social media in particular makes that a lot easier. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9197.36s)]
*  And now these companies that own these things are not American companies. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9201.279999999999s)]
*  They're global multinational corporations and they benefit. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9204.0s)]
*  But America gave them, in most cases, that opportunity to be so successful, [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9208.039999999999s)]
*  to be so wildly wealthy, [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9212.52s)]
*  more wealthy than most anyone in the history of the world. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9215.36s)]
*  So it's a tough time. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9219.119999999999s)]
*  It's a weird time. It's a weird time. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9220.88s)]
*  Man, it is so crazy. But yeah, but border patrol. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9223.0s)]
*  I mean, those guys down there, they get and law enforcement in general, [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9226.2s)]
*  teachers in general, like I met a guy yesterday, came to a book signing. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9229.800000000001s)]
*  And he was a law enforcement 20 years and became a teacher. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9233.52s)]
*  It's like the two things that are just vilified right now. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9236.720000000001s)]
*  I'm getting shot up, you know, just figuratively. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9239.08s)]
*  It's just that's well, my goodness, he's asking for trouble. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9243.76s)]
*  But what a great guy. He was awesome. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9246.320000000002s)]
*  And he brought a civil war musket, not a musket, civil war [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9247.84s)]
*  percussion rifle and brought it showed it to me at this book signing. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9251.08s)]
*  And what a great guy. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9254.44s)]
*  But, jeez, people still want to serve. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9255.4s)]
*  They want to stand up there as law enforcement. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9257.880000000001s)]
*  Austin, I know, has an issue with that right now. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9259.4s)]
*  Border Patrol agents, teachers. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9262.4s)]
*  I mean, what a tough time to be in those positions. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9264.2s)]
*  I know. And they're just not appreciated in our culture. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9266.2s)]
*  For whatever reason, doesn't celebrate them like they should. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9268.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate those guys every day. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9271.880000000001s)]
*  And I think about them every day. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9273.800000000001s)]
*  So thankful that they're out there every day, willing to do that job, [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9275.16s)]
*  willing to be teachers, willing to put themselves on the line, on the border, [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9279.32s)]
*  willing to to suit up and get in that squad car and roll into the city [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9282.6s)]
*  or whatever else, knowing that there's a whole segment of society [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9286.28s)]
*  that wants to vilify them no matter what they do. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9288.960000000001s)]
*  And it's a tough position. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9291.16s)]
*  Very tough, hard, hard on the morale, especially police officers. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9292.44s)]
*  Well, and teachers, both of them. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9297.08s)]
*  You're right. That's those are the two people that are most maligned. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9299.0s)]
*  The two groups of people. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9302.16s)]
*  I think you're drawn to those things for good reasons. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9303.960000000001s)]
*  You want to teach kids or whatever else. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9306.84s)]
*  And all of a sudden you find yourself embroiled in some crazy controversy. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9308.640000000001s)]
*  And you're like, I just want to teach kids some history or want to teach them that. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9311.16s)]
*  Yeah. Whatever it might be. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9313.8s)]
*  And same thing with with cops. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9315.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're getting that squad car to protect and they go out and people [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9316.6s)]
*  make a mistake. And there's good people and bad people in every single institution [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9319.08s)]
*  and every single organization. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9322.32s)]
*  Doesn't matter what it is. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9323.76s)]
*  But then the mistakes are vilified and then used to divide a country. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9324.84s)]
*  Not just politically. Yeah. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeX2RUPXsaM&t=9328.92s)]
