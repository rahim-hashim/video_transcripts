# Joe Rogan Experience #1509 - Abigail Shrier
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtftWcgXjdg)
*  Hello Abigail, how are you? I'm doing great. How are you? Thanks for doing this. Appreciate it. Thanks so much for having me on
*  Irreversible damage the transgender craze seducing our daughters boy
*  That's a hot buttons object, right? That is a this is a minefield. It shouldn't be though
*  No, it really shouldn't be no it shouldn't be but
*  So I think we should probably establish some things like upfront, right?
*  Some people surely as adults are transgender, of course. Yes, of course. I interviewed a lot of them and
*  We fully support that. Absolutely. Okay. I have friends who fall into that category. Your concern is about
*  Very young children that teenage girls has nothing to do with adults who are transgender
*  Okay, many of whom are amazing people they you know went through mental health
*  You know therapy and they decided they made this decisions
*  they suffered with discomfort in their bodies from the time they were young and
*  As adults they made a decision to transition fully support them has nothing to do with my book. What what what?
*  Was the motivation to write this book and if it's about teenagers, why is there a very young girl on the cover?
*  Well, this is like the cover. It looks like a little girl
*  Right. It does. I mean, I obviously I didn't do cover but I think I think the cover is very good
*  Because I think it's supposed to evoke what we've lost in our a whole generation
*  Well, yes, what is that? I assume her uterus
*  Infertility is what's like a pill. Yeah. Oh infertility. Yeah, that's what that's what happens
*  I mean I I involved in this this wasn't a personal issue for me. In fact, it was an issue originally
*  I thought I was gonna avoid a reader wrote to me
*  I write most often for the Wall Street Journal and a reader wrote to me and she said listen
*  I've tried to get every mainstream journalist to pick this up
*  No one will touch it but my daughter got caught up in this all of a sudden she went off to college all of a
*  Sudden with her friend. She had a lot of mental health issues anxiety depression and all of a sudden with her group of friends
*  They all decided they're trans and she went on hormones and this is happening to parents all across the country teenage girls all of a
*  Sudden deciding with their friends. They're trans wanting surgeries and hormones and getting them and at first I thought I don't need this
*  And so I tried to get another journalist to take it up a real investigative reporter
*  I'm not I'm an opinion journalist usually, you know, that's what I've done and I couldn't get someone to take it up
*  because it's such a
*  minefield because yeah because it's a minefield because for some reason the activists who are not
*  representative of transgender adults that I've met at all
*  but the activists had convinced the world that because you know, they they you know object to anyone's
*  Transition being questioned we can't talk about a mental health issue facing teenage girls now I've heard
*  There's an issue with some teenage girls who are on the spectrum who wind up getting
*  Sort of roped into this idea that that's what's wrong with them. Is that one of the things you cover in your book?
*  Yeah, I actually don't deal with that
*  Specifically very much and the reason is that's a whole book in and of itself
*  Because a lot of that it is true that a lot of girls who are high-functioning
*  Autistic and I did interview some experts in autism and that's when I realized that's a book of its own
*  Which is that a lot of girls who are high-functioning autistic, you know
*  they tend to fixate and they had they are particularly susceptible to fixating on the idea that they might be a boy when it's
*  introduced to them
*  So, yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about and they are one part of this phenomenon, but they're a big part
*  So the teenage girl part so this you're talking about
*  teenage girls that are
*  Susceptible to influence are you talking about teenage girls that are confused?
*  Like why why are there so many teenage girls that are going in this direction?
*  Like what do you think is happening? So these are the same girls that would have been anorexic
*  They would have been bulimic and they would have been they are high anxiety very precocious girls
*  But they don't really fit in they come to high school and they don't have friends
*  they don't have a click for them and
*  They're so smart and they're so lonely because they're on the internet all the time and they're with mom all the time and they don't
*  fit in at school and this is a way to
*  Understand they're just there their pain that they're really feeling they're in pain
*  But they decide that their problem is that they're supposed to be a boy and the fix is testosterone
*  so you
*  Heard of this problem you knew of people that their children were going through this and
*  How long did it take you before you decided to commit to pen to paper on this?
*  So I spent a maybe a month or so just hearing the reports of the parents and reading the original study
*  There's an original study that the book is you know jump
*  jumps off from which is the Lisa Litman paper at Brown University's public health researcher who looked into this and she found that there was
*  all of a sudden this huge epidemic in America of
*  teenage girls deciding they were trans with their friends after social media emerging and
*  And pushing for hormones and surgeries have you had a conversation about this with someone who's a trans activist that says well
*  Maybe what's really going on? I mean, I'm just taking the argument of it
*  Maybe what's going on is there are a lot of trans women and there would be more or there's a lot of women who would turn
*  Trans become a man there would be more
*  But they never had had that door open to them before and that maybe there's more trans people than we think amazing amazing
*  So it's a great point and I thought about it because I've you know, I tried to look I'm a journalist
*  I like to look at ideas in both sides. I didn't have like I did not have a dog in this race
*  So let me tell you three reasons. I don't think that's compelling number one when when Lisa Litman looked at the prevalence rate
*  She found that it's 70 times what we would expect within a friend group
*  Which means it's highly concentrated in groups of friends, but there's two other reasons
*  So we wouldn't expect that if it were randomly distributed along the population, but there's two other reasons
*  I don't think that's right number one
*  If we're just reverting to normal now that there's greater society societal acceptance, right?
*  We're just say we're just avoiding to reverting to a normal base rate of transgender women
*  Where were all the women in their 40s and 60s coming out as trans they should be coming out now is their time
*  Now is their moment we should see tons of women in their 40s and 60s and so on coming out as transgender
*  We're not seeing that we're seeing the same population that gets involved in cutting demonic possession
*  witchcraft
*  Anorexia bulimian convinces themselves. There's a problem and and there's one anyway
*  There's there's one last reason is that suicide rates are going up?
*  But if these women who were living under a prior, you know
*  Supposedly these all these transgender these real transgender people who are living under a more repressive regime and are now just finding themselves
*  This you would think the suicide rate would be going down with greater acceptance
*  So when you're saying suicide rates are going up you mean suicide rates with teens who turn trans both
*  We that's the rate of trans of suicide among this population first of all among girls in general is extraordinarily high
*  This is just one part of the mental health crisis
*  And
*  Second of all we know that the rate that these these kids these trans identified kids have very high rates of suicide
*  Suicidal ideation it's it's really you know an area of real concern
*  Well, there's definitely an area of real concern as well with social media
*  Did you read Jonathan Heights book the coddling of the American mind? Yeah, and it was on your show
*  That I really like this light bulb went on when I rewatched it because he talked about
*  Exactly this he connects it to social media and he talked about on your show the huge rates
*  We're seeing an anxiety depression all that among these same girls
*  And you know putting it together with Lisa Lippman's research and the other investigation I'd done
*  I think it's really pretty clear that one more
*  Manifestation of these girls who are we know are involved in a lot of cutting and all kinds of self-harm
*  This is one form of self-harm for them
*  So there are chill so let's essentially say there's young teenagers that are confused and
*  They're looking for something that makes them feel whole or something that makes them feel normal or something that gives them some sort of an escape
*  from this angst that they suffer from and
*  you're thinking that
*  Turning trans is one of those pathways that they gravitate towards
*  But it might not necessarily be a good idea for them. Yeah, that's exactly right
*  If these girls were transitioning to boys and they were living great lives and their mental health was great
*  Like it is for so many transgender adults. I wouldn't have written this book. That's a great story
*  Like it is great for so many transgender adults because even in transgender adults the suicide rates very high
*  There's no question and that's you know, that's a separate issue, but I do think that I yeah, I agree
*  I think that there are I personally believe that there are transgender adults who've been helped by transition
*  But these girls are not being helped by transition just universally I think as a population
*  Yeah, I mean that's that's what Lisa Lisa Lippman study showed but also through my investigation, you know
*  I hear from I interview a lot of parents. I also interview transgender youth and
*  They you know, they'll tell you their anxiety is a mess. Their depression is a mess
*  Transitions not curing these girls. They drop out of school. They cut off their families. They're not living a great life
*  It's a it's such a strange call right and it mean I mean strange I don't mean strange in a
*  negative way, I mean, it's
*  you're dealing with hormones in a human body like you're you're taking a woman and
*  You're injecting hormones into her body and you're saying that these exogenous hormones are what's going to fix her and
*  I never I never understand that like if this is my argument about this
*  How do we know how do you know that that's what's going to do it and when you are doing that
*  What damage is being done?
*  It's one thing if someone's a 25 year old woman and they say I have always wanted to be a man
*  And I think I'm a man. I think I was I think I'm born in the wrong body
*  But when you're going through this developmental cycle from 17 18 19 20
*  There is a lot of chaos. There's a lot of hormonal chaos. There's a lot of confusion
*  I don't think there's anything specifically that you can point to that could say some sort of an intervention
*  Chemically some sort of if you just step in now and start injecting this body with male hormones
*  It's gonna fix all your problems. Yeah, it's really popular to do that. It's really popular
*  These girls are getting it on their own diagnosis. So they're just going in and self-diagnosing. Nobody questions it
*  We now have informed consent, which means you walk into Planned Parenthood. You sign a waiver you decide you have gender dysphoria
*  You walk out that day with testosterone Planned Parenthood is doing. Yeah, it's one of the biggest distributors
*  So you don't have to have some sort of a long
*  Some transitional therapy session with you can get your breasts removed with no therapist note
*  Whoa, yeah, so you could be a confused 18 year old girl and
*  walk into a Planned Parenthood self diagnosing with no therapy at all and
*  They'll prescribe testosterone and you can get your breast room. Absolutely you sign a form. Oh
*  Wait, wait, wait, you can't even get your breast removed at Planned Parenthood. No, sorry
*  No, you can also get your breast removed from yes surgeons surgeons
*  Some some of them require a therapist note
*  I interviewed him in my book some who do not and and you know, there are you know, both kinds Jesus
*  That's a big decision, right? That's a decision that you can't really come back from
*  What what did the surge have you talked to surgeons yes, what do they think they think that
*  Obviously we're generalizing right? So they think a couple things
*  I mean, obviously there are a lot of surgeons who refuse to do it
*  So I interviewed them as well
*  They say you don't destroy the biological function like I didn't become a doctor to destroy someone's biological function for you know
*  Something that they've decided they have without even you know any oversight or but but the ones who do it say look this population
*  Is really desperate for surgery. It's a civil rights issue. I you know if I'm you know, I'm
*  Giving them what they what will seem to bring them comfort seems to bring them comfort
*  The problem is that there's no like follow-up to see how their mental health is afterwards
*  The surgeon is basically a mechanic, right? They just remove the tires. Well, you on your way
*  Yeah, the problem is we're not cars, right? Right. It's all connected
*  Right, it's all connected. So unfortunately very often the mental health deteriorate. I mean I talked to one young woman
*  Desmond who's amazing and she she decided in high school. She was trans she got celebrated everywhere her teachers her
*  Therapist told her yeah, you're definitely a man. You're supposed to be a man
*  Affirmed her everywhere. She went she got on testosterone and it caused uterine cramping which can happen
*  It's one of the many bad side effects of testosterone she had to have a hysterectomy
*  So at 21 she wakes up with a hysterectomy
*  And she realized this whole thing had been a giant mistake
*  Her mental health had not improved at all and this was a huge
*  Like mistake and path she had gone on and all of a sudden she didn't know what to do
*  There was no one cheering her on anymore
*  Why do you think people get cheered on for this decision? I
*  Think in America we have a weakness for anything that gets cloaked in civil rights and part of that is very noble and good
*  Obviously the civil rights movement was extremely important in our country and and and extremely, you know
*  valuable and
*  Valorous, but but now anything that gets called a civil rights issue you can't question
*  So I interview parents and they'll tell me they're almost all politically progressive
*  Okay
*  Most the parents I've called me are politically progressive and I interviewed almost five dozen of them now and
*  They'll tell me like I support LGBTQ
*  But I really I'm not sure this is right for my daughter. Like I don't I don't think she's really gender dysphoric
*  She's getting worse. Like what is going on here? And I'll say to them, would you take away her binder?
*  You know binders that compression garment they wear to flatten their breasts and they'll say to me. Oh, I can't do that
*  I mean, I you know, I support LGBTQ and whatnot and I'll say to her, you know, sometimes I'll say them
*  Would you give her cigarettes?
*  Why don't you give her cigarettes?
*  Cuz cuz a binder will deform breast tissue it can cause rib cracking it can cause shortness of breath
*  You know, I'm not I wasn't aware of these binders. So this is something like corset. Yeah, but yeah, right
*  So it makes them look like a man
*  So it's got a squash and if you're you know, a big breasted woman, it's gonna squash even harder
*  I mean, it's gonna really try to flatten you to give you the physique, you know the appearance of a male physique
*  So but it's just an appearance thing or is it so that's just an appearance thing
*  They usually 16 year old girls don't usually go straight to top surgery. They start with a binder or you know, 13 14 year olds
*  so do you think that
*  something about
*  People are really susceptible to praise right when they lean towards love and they lean towards anything that celebrates their actions
*  It's real common. I mean you see it with artists and sometimes
*  Sometimes for the worst right you see see with comedians
*  Which is my
*  General area of expertise when it comes to this you see
*  Sometimes a comic will do something particularly online
*  And then they get sort of celebrated for that and then they start doing a lot of it and it seems just ingenuous and weird
*  But they're like fishing for for love and you see it with social media and particularly with people
*  I mean, this is a lot of what happens with social justice warriors and online virtue signaling, right?
*  They're trying to get this reaction from people
*  So if someone
*  Comes out as trans and everyone celebrates if perhaps they're a little confused and they come out as trans and no one says anything
*  And then they're just sort of they have to sit and think about it for themselves. That's one way
*  But if someone comes out as trans and everybody says that's amazing. That's amazing. They want that feeling of that's amazing
*  That's exactly right. So I talk about this in my book
*  I never did this young woman Benji who was going through a really hard time and in middle school really hard and at 13
*  You know, she got really into these YouTube trans stars and who promised testosterone is like the greatest thing ever and she's
*  She decided to start an account on one of the social media, you know sites and she came out as trans and
*  Everybody congratulated her. This is a girl who was lonely. Everyone was telling her, you know, this is the yours
*  You should be I'm so proud of you. I'm there for you
*  I'm your glitter family and a lot of them were adults and lo and behold she waits
*  You know all of a sudden they start asking for things like pictures
*  Mmm, right and I talked to transgender adults like I talked to this I interviewed this trans woman in crystal in my book who was
*  You know very very night
*  I interviewed her and and she made the decision as an adult to transition and she said to me it was biological man
*  Now now woman and and and she said to me, you know when Caitlin happened
*  It was a nightmare for me because I had been going around in my job
*  I know I didn't look perfectly like a woman but I felt comfortable like I wasn't now I had people crossing the street to hug me
*  She said it was embarrassing. Like I had people in restaurants stopping to celebrate me. Oh
*  Well, it's on one hand
*  See, this is where I'm torn because on one hand if you are trans and you do feel better about this
*  But you confuse how people are gonna react and then all of a sudden people are celebrating you like yes, this is great
*  I love the idea of an accepting society and people are open loving and happy that someone is making this transition
*  but on the other hand
*  I'm very aware of the influence of the masses and and of just people's love and praise
*  It can shift you one way or another. I mean, I mean, it's like a classic scene in a movie, right?
*  Where there's a boy who doesn't want to get involved in manly things and then but his dad's like come on son
*  I want you to do it and he just does it for his dad
*  Then he feels bad about it. Like that's classic. Like human beings are so malleable. We're so easily influenced
*  That's that's exactly right. And that's what people miss like, you know teenage girls
*  They can convince themselves of lots of things because they're going through a hard time
*  Right puberty is hard not having boys like you and now you had social media
*  They don't have a chance at looking like these face-tuned celebrities or even their face-tuned friends, right?
*  So they feel terrible about themselves
*  That is one of the things that Jonathan Haidt talked about when in terms of social media like the comparison of each other
*  I mean and what you're talking about facetuned is perfect, too
*  the I don't know if you're there was which one was it Chloe the
*  Face one. Okay, Chloe Kardashian took a photo and put it on Instagram and it's not her. I mean, it's just not her
*  It's not her face and and a friend of mine. She she sent this to me
*  she's like what the fuck is going on and she showed me that
*  While they had photoshopped her photo they had accidentally removed part of her chain
*  So she had a chain on like a thin chain
*  She had the pendant but the the right side of the chain is missing because they had this these wacky photo filters and they
*  Reshaped her face and it's like it's not her right
*  So if you're a kid and you look like Chloe what she used to look like is kind of a little bit awkward
*  You think you're ugly? Yeah, and then all of a sudden she looks like someone who's an anime character
*  Perfect woman, you know in terms of like society's
*  Beauty standards and that's not even really what she looks like
*  So if you're a kid and you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're looking at this picture of her you like fuck
*  What do I have to do? Right? What how do I look like that? Why do I look like this? I hate myself
*  That's exactly what happens the girls in your class put facetune photos up
*  Yeah, so you stare you sit there and you're like, I'm not as pretty. Oh my god
*  She's got ten times the number of friends likes that I have or whatever
*  I love that expression facetuned. I've never heard that
*  Auto-tune for right exactly facetune
*  Yeah, it's that comparison thing so strange
*  It's really weird that people do that these filters that they use and it's it's very strange
*  I mean look at Lana Del Rey, right?
*  She came out with an out because she came out with an audiobook last week and she went to celebrate it on social media
*  She posted a picture and the first comment on it is you look fat
*  So young girls see that and they think they don't have a chance
*  This is one of the most streamed recording art female recording artists ever right beautiful woman
*  You look fat as the first comment. Well, that's a troll, you know, right? She's not fat. It's Lana Del Rey
*  Did she get fat? No, she's not fat. Did she get a little heavy? I don't know. I haven't kept up on her way
*  Let me see what Lana Del Rey looks like. Let me see that picture. I
*  Want to I mean this one thing if she actually got large that's just a mean person
*  But if she didn't that's a troll, right? But teenage girls don't evaluate it that way. I understand that
*  So they should not be online. They should not be you should not be on social media
*  No, there's a lot of them should not be on social media. I mean
*  Not even just teenage like well into womanhood
*  I know women that like read things and they get they'll ruin their whole day
*  Like it'll wake them up in the middle of the night. It's not good
*  No, and it's these faceless nameless people that are saying these mean things that
*  Aren't even accurate but for whatever reason they resonate. Yeah, women have always been like really
*  Empathetic creatures they like care about what their friends think they care about what other people think, you know, it's some of them
*  Massive generalization about trans people about doctors
*  No, but but here's here's why I say that because the reason that's there's a reason that social contagion spreads among teenage girls
*  specifically, okay
*  Because you don't see tons of boys going around becoming anorexic because their friends are if a teenage boy is depressed
*  His friend says to him, let's go play basketball or video game
*  He doesn't say let's sit and talk about it
*  And because girls try to take on their friends pain very naturally and meet their friends where they are and they care they take
*  On the pain of other people especially their girlfriends
*  They are more likely to share and spread a pure contagion like like anorexia like cutting and like trans identification
*  That's fascinating. You're talking about these mental health disorders
*  Like they're a contagion like they're actually contagious like you can give it to your friends and your friends can take it on as well
*  Well, we know this right anorexics. They are always really careful when they put them together
*  They have to be on hospital wards because we know that it will cause it to spread anorexia will become more severe and they'll spread
*  it if you put a bunch of anorexic girls together and you don't you don't take precautions to make sure that they're not just
*  Encouraging each other to lose more and more weight. Well that sort of phenomenon
*  exists in men as well, but it exists like if if
*  Like a good aspect of it is if you have friends that are very ambitious and work really hard
*  You'll want to be ambitious and work really hard as well
*  And if you have friends that are losers and they want to drink and just waste their life
*  You tend to gravitate towards that too because you get reinforced by the behavior and the acceptance of your peers
*  Yeah, and then men are more competitive for sure. I think men are more outwardly competitive their buddies
*  Do you know I see it in my my kids, you know
*  If I say to one brother your brother's doing this all of a sudden I have the other one's attention
*  Yeah, don't look like what do you got what's her Instagram
*  It's been with me to see it work there go um do we need a new box
*  There's a book, but I've done nothing on there. I mean, there's where's the where's the image? She's a little fat
*  That's outrageous. Which one did you see where they said she was fat? I think it might have been that one
*  I don't know the one on the audiobook. Yeah
*  Was it a video or was it a photo? It was a photo. I think I just looked at it
*  Yeah
*  That's long last week. I think oh well earlier this week anybody who said okay, let me stop right there
*  Anybody who said that's fat is a troll. You're right. That's just a guy probably who's an asshole
*  Well, it was a lot
*  I think it looked like it was a woman posting actually because I was curious about that
*  But if I was gonna be a troll
*  I pretend to be a woman and just be the meanest woman ever and just go on these women's pages and make them feel bad
*  I think there's a lot of people men and women that really enjoy hurting people's feelings online
*  Yeah, you know if you look at that woman right there and say you look fat. Well that
*  Why not say you look like a giraffe because both of them are
*  Equally inaccurate. She doesn't look fat at all. Right, but teen girls aren't good at like assessing that
*  So for instance, I talked to one D transition or so she had gone on testosterone and regretted it came back
*  Yeah, D transition our young woman Helena brilliant young woman and I really you know learned a lot from her one thing
*  She said to me was you know
*  Everybody just cares about how perfect you look today and how feminine and and at the time I said to her
*  I was interviewing her and I said wait a second. Hold on. What are you talking about?
*  Like I just saw a star is born with Lady Gaga
*  She's not perfect looking but she's an awesomely talented human being like a woman that every young
*  You know actress should and singer should be looking up to and she said to me and I'll never forget that she said to me
*  Are you kidding? Do you see how they talk about her online?
*  And I realized I was only look listening to her albums and seeing her in the movie
*  But Helena was looking at social media and she was seeing women, you know, even as amazing as Lady Gaga torn apart
*  Yeah again
*  This is the problem with social media that we kind of discussed in the green room about the percentage of people that are really fucking
*  Stupid that are posting you're getting a lot of people
*  see if you just have
*  People commenting on things without knowing who they are
*  like if you're if you work in an office and you have a bunch of people in your office that you respect and they're your
*  peers and
*  They say Abigail. I think this and you go. Hmm. That's interesting Mary because I respect your opinion
*  So I'm gonna have to take that into consideration, but if you just read some
*  No, you know, no face no name. You don't know who the fuck it is
*  You know blocked account and they write something mean you will take that
*  Into your brain the same way you'll take your friend Mary who you respect and love
*  It's like it's a problem with human beings the way we process information
*  If we don't have like if you know that someone's a moron, they say something you'd be like, well Mike's a moron
*  Everyone knows Mike's a moron. It's clear
*  But when you just read something in text your text looks just like some idiots text, right?
*  You're using the same font, you know, it comes off of an iPhone just like him
*  And it's hard to tell it's hard to differentiate and when people are doing it specifically just to be mean
*  It can be very very confusing and it just highlights the really poor
*  quality of discourse that you get when you're you know reading comments and you're you're dealing with social media and
*  YouTube comments and Twitter and all that stuff
*  Like it's just a really bad way to communicate with people and most of the people that are saying shitty things
*  Would not say those shitty things if they're right in front of you
*  That's exactly right
*  And I think one of the things that makes it even worse is because somebody makes a mean comment to you
*  Okay, maybe it bothers you. Maybe it doesn't right but it's not in front of I don't know a thousand of your friends
*  Now it's in front of a thousand of your friends. That's humiliating. Yes. Yeah. Wow, you just amplified that
*  Yes. Yeah. Well, we're not designed for this. Yeah, you know, we really aren't
*  It was something like me. I mean, I'm pretty thick skin, but I'm not designed for it
*  So I don't read it. I just don't read it. I post things and I run away, you know
*  it's like some people can just sit in there and and
*  Try to soak up all the hate and turn people around I've heard people say oh they say me things to me
*  But I say nice things back and they say hey, I was only kidding
*  I'm like why waste your time like what do you do? What are you doing? You're gonna proselytize you're gonna fix people
*  What are you doing? Like you're you're you're engaging in one of the worst forms of communication
*  We have available to us anonymous human beings that just post their opinions. Let their opinions be their opinions
*  I don't I don't have any power of people's opinions. Let them have their opinions. It's hard not to I mean
*  Like I think it's really hard like somebody's supposed to post something about you on Facebook or Twitter or whatever
*  Everybody's seeing that. Yeah, you just got called the name in front of thousand people
*  You know way more depending on which you know forum is on whatever it's it's really hard to just ignore it now
*  It's really hard and it's particularly hard if you're young and developing, you know, it's really hard if you're a 50 year old man
*  But if you're a 17 year old girl and you're in this awkward time in your life, it can be really devastating
*  Yeah, but that's why they shouldn't be on it. Yeah, it's fucking bad for them. It's bad for everybody
*  I agree, but I tell I tell parents if you can, you know, don't introduce social media and get them off it
*  It's the problem is the friends are right, you know, I'm one of my daughters who's 12 her friend has an Instagram page
*  She's like I want an Instagram page. I'm like you are out of your mind. Like you don't want that
*  I think you want that you don't want that your friend doesn't even want that
*  Let's check in with her in three years when she's going crazy, right? It's not good, right?
*  So we've we can now pinpoint right a lot of mental health issues, especially for teenage girls, right to social media
*  Yeah, and again the coddling of the American mind is a fantastic absolutely that covers that and you know, it's not just girls
*  It's boys. It's humans. It's adults. It's grown women's grown men
*  It's just it's a really bad way to communicate with each other and a bad way to exchange ideas
*  And now they're telling they're watching these you there these influencers, which is another thing
*  You know, you have these trans influencers and they promise these girls that if they just go on tea
*  Everything will get better and the problem. Why do you think they do that? Okay, so why do they a couple reasons? So one is
*  Testosterone has certain good effects. So it delivers a euphoria and
*  It's it suppresses anxiety and anxiety is one of their biggest problems
*  So they go on it and they feel great and they can't wait to tell their friends
*  It makes their period go away and it redistributes fat. So now these girls feel like I just beat
*  Puberty, I feel amazing. I want to tell everybody how great I feel and they are brave all of a sudden
*  They're braver and socially bolder
*  The problem is of course what they don't like to talk about online is all the really dangerous stuff that comes with testosterone
*  too, like it leads to heart
*  Infertility like risk of cardiovascular attack, you know a heart attack risk of heart attack goes way up
*  There's you know body hair facial hair
*  Don't they want that?
*  So I think body hair facial hair part for now, but it's permanent
*  You know a lot of here is permanent it can be
*  But what about when trans women when a man transitions to a woman? Don't they lose a lot of their body hair?
*  They lose some of it, but some of them are I mean everybody's different
*  But some of them are stuck with a five o'clock shadow for life
*  How does a kid know whether they are someone who's being easily influenced and someone who is?
*  giving in to this anxiety and
*  You are a part of the way you're describing a contagion amongst your friends
*  Versus someone who's genuinely trans like someone who genuinely is born in the wrong body
*  So we have a hundred year diagnostic history of gender dysphoria. We know what it is. It's not guesswork
*  We know that it is in this whole history
*  It typically presents in early childhood ages two to four is when we see it starting and it was
*  Overwhelmingly boys little boys who say no mommy. I'm not a boy. I'm a girl
*  Call me a girl only want to play with other girls only want to do
*  You know play with girl toys and they sometimes they hate their sexual organ
*  I mean sometimes you know it's a severe persistent insistent consistent feeling
*  And and then a lot of them would grow out of it and some of them wouldn't and they would become what we used to
*  call transsexuals
*  Now we're seeing an explosion of young women
*  You know suddenly deciding they're trans with their friends and they are doing it in friend groups
*  They'll have a whole friend group of trans kids
*  They are you know doing it after social media emerging
*  Transgender adults never did it because of social media and it certainly never won them friends
*  Hmm
*  So what about women that were trans like you say predominantly it's it's boys who wanted to be girls
*  But what about girls who wanted to be boys so that existed too and that also typically began in early childhood
*  And most most of these kids have left alone would outgrow it
*  So gender dysphoria is something that you know most most kids if they even if they experience the real thing will outgrow
*  And some won't yeah, I was reading an article about gender dysphoria
*  They were talking about it first of all even saying gender dysphoria. I think is hate speech now
*  I think you're supposed to send the DSM. I know the whole DSM hate speech. Yes
*  But you know what I mean to me like everything's hate speech
*  Because people are gone. They've gone so wacky, but they were talking about
*  there was a
*  study done on men who
*  experienced gender dysphoria at a young age and then
*  Transition to become gay and just be just became gay just were gay and they realized like this was just a part of their process
*  And they're happy as a gay man and they didn't transition
*  So that's very typical most of these most of these kids would emerge as homosexual adults
*  That's the thing is just like if we're cool with people being trans and we are obviously we mean especially adults
*  why
*  You know
*  Why is it better that do we like this idea that if you just leave them alone they become gay men or?
*  Would we I mean how many of them would be trans if they were encouraged in that direction?
*  How many of are they happier this way or that way like this is a very this is a very human problem
*  Yeah, by human problem. I mean there's not really a good answer. It's there human problems are slippery problems where it's like you're developing like
*  Particularly you're talking about young people there. We're
*  Highjacking their development you're just you're deciding okay. Have you made a decision? You know what you're gonna do forever alright
*  We're gonna jump in now, and we're gonna stop your reproductive cycle right we're gonna jump in now and introduce hormones that were never in your
*  Body and we're gonna well a little bit tiny tiny mouse
*  We're gonna jack it up to the roof like fucking Hulk Hogan, and you're you're gonna be a different person now
*  And I hope you can make this decision at 17 that will affect the rest of your life
*  I hope you're you're mentally capable of doing that and that's a tall order
*  It's a tall order, and there's no medical oversight right now. There's no matter
*  I mean we have no idea what long-term testosterone use does to a female's body at 10 to 40 times what her body would normally
*  Have okay, we don't know we can talk about the risks
*  But we don't know but it's not presented to people as a highly experimental medicine which it is
*  It's not reviewed by an institutional review board
*  They make it sound like it's something you can just sign a waiver for and no big deal
*  Why is that why is there no review why is there no oversight? Why is this so free and loose?
*  I mean is it a sign is it a good sign that we're like more progressive now more open-minded and but because of that
*  things have gotten a little slippery in terms of what we celebrate and what we should rationally step back and objectively
*  Analyze and say hey is this really the right way to handle this
*  I think one of the things that happened was in 2012 W path, which is the transgender health, you know
*  Organization worldwide organization
*  Changed to an informed consent model saying that people should be able to get the drugs they want or you know
*  Claim to need on based on their own
*  Recognizance you sign a form you're aware of the risk and then you get it and the problem was
*  Maybe they felt that there was too much gatekeeping as they call it or too much questioning
*  They felt and you know that there were people who weren't getting the medical care
*  They they needed the problem was you hit 18 and the age of medical consent varies by state in Oregon is 15
*  It varies and you hit that age you can you can get it you walk out the door with an organ. It's 15
*  Yeah, that's crazy. You're not even a fully formed person. No, and you don't need your parents approval. Oh my god
*  We were talking before we got on the air about
*  Children like really young children transitioning you were saying that most people who transition know when they're very young
*  That is a real
*  That's a hot-button topic for people
*  Children and hormone blockers and children
*  What I keep going to is if you are a woman and
*  You you know, you're a woman
*  Why do you need to get these hormones injected into your body? Why why can't you just be a woman?
*  I'll call you a woman. Like what are we doing with all these hormones? Like why are we?
*  completely like
*  imagine you're a person who says I
*  Need to transition to be a woman and I know that I need a chemical that I've never had in my body before and if
*  I get that chemical injected then I'm gonna be happy
*  Right, so I get surgery then I'm gonna be happy. This is what I'm supposed to be right
*  So the big problem with this is that you're making all the decisions that normally a doctor would make and you do it
*  Right any other area of medicine a doctor makes that they say hold on. I know you think you need, you know
*  Whatever an opioid but just relax
*  Let's see what your you know, I mean that's you know, effectively what you know, what facilitate the opioid crisis doctors
*  Just handing over the prescription pad and we're seeing that right now with anybody who claims to have gender dysphoria
*  They get it. They self diagnose they say no, no, no, I know it's my problem
*  They don't have a mental health professional who says oh, wait a second. Hold on. You have a very high anxiety depression
*  You have a lot of other mental health stuff going on
*  Let's deal with that first any therapist who dares to say that might violate one of the 19 conversion therapy laws
*  We now have in 19 different states. There's 19 conversion. Yeah, which bans conversion
*  So-called conversion therapy even on gender identity, which means that therapists could lose our license if they say hold on
*  I know you want to transition. I know you think your problem is gender dysphoria
*  Let's talk about some of your other problems
*  Wow
*  so a therapist if you're a 15 year old kid you come to a therapist and you say
*  All my friends are going trans and I think I'm trans too
*  The doctor has to essentially go with you on this little path you're on the doctors feel that they have to I mean the American
*  The number of Association American Medical Association
*  Endocrine society, I mean you name an American Pediatric Society, you know all these medical professional organizations
*  Most of them have adopted affirmative care, which means their job is to affirm the patient self diagnosis with regard to this one issue
*  I mean
*  They're there, you know, it's turning doctors into I don't life coaches, right?
*  I mean there how much time have we been doing this for how long is the time period when this really started to escalate?
*  The last decade we've seen it fly across the West. I mean it's in Canada UK, you know, Scandinavia
*  We're seeing numbers across the West all of a sudden. It's teenage girls
*  It's the very same girls who spread every other you know contemporary hysteria or every other hysteria
*  um
*  boy
*  It makes you feel like there's a lot of lawsuits coming. I
*  Wouldn't be surprised. I mean these doc these girls are getting these things so easily and they're 15. They're 16. They're 17
*  They're 18. How many did you interview when you were doing this book?
*  So I conducted almost 200 interviews
*  So how many teenage girls or specifically? I actually don't know I interviewed a lot a lot of people and
*  And a bunch of adolescent girls as well and more than 10 more than 20
*  Yeah more than 10, but I don't know I have to I have a like spreadsheets for this
*  Um, yeah, did you interview ones that were happy with the transition? Yeah. Yeah
*  You know still very young but I you know, I interviewed influencers and I interviewed
*  Parents and I interviewed adolescent girls and some of these girls have you know can stayed with their transition and claimed to be happy
*  Maybe they are some of them
*  But the problem is if you ask if you find out objective things about their lives
*  Right. Are you still in school or did you drop out or did you cut off your family or did you not?
*  Do you have friends? What's your social life? Like what's your job? Do you have a regular job?
*  Very often the picture is is a dark one. It's not a good one
*  Isn't that just the case with a lot of people in general though
*  I mean especially people that have
*  The kind of problems that they have to begin with and they make this gigantic decision
*  The question is did this decision of transitioning help or hurt right and where would they be if they didn't you were talking about them?
*  Before saying they were already in a dark place. They're already awkward
*  Teenagers the kind of girls who cut themselves kind of girls were prone to anorexia and witchcraft
*  This is you're dealing with someone who doesn't have a rosy future already
*  Right, but I think we used to call that angst teenage angst. I mean they got past it the problem is
*  Yeah, you're right. Not everyone but now they're getting they're getting prescriptions
*  They're changing the whole course of their lives so easily with no medical oversight
*  What kind of numbers are we talking about? Like how many people are doing this?
*  Okay, so the numbers are harder to track in the United States because we don't have centralized medical care
*  and
*  Here but here are the numbers that I can tell you
*  Okay, so gender dysphoria used to afflict point oh one percent of the population. So one in ten thousand people
*  So probably no one you went to high school with but today we already know that two percent of high school students are identifying as transgender
*  And two percent of high school students you're talking about one point one million teenage
*  You know high school kids in America two percent two percent and when did this happen?
*  Most of them are girls. Yeah, really most of them are girls. Most of them are girls really
*  Well, I mean the number we can just look at the number of gender surgeries
*  And we see that in 2016 between 2016 and 2017 the number of gender surgeries for biological females
*  quadrupled
*  So we know they are the biggest and fastest growing population
*  Wow
*  To that's a stunning number two percent you go from
*  0.1 percent of the whole population of the whole population to two percent of high schoolers and
*  The vast majority of them are teenage girls. Yeah, what what what is the majority? We talk about 80% Like what is the number?
*  I don't know
*  We know that you know, I can give you a bunch of other statistics
*  one of the reasons it's hard to know exactly how many aside from the fact that we don't have a centralized control of this is
*  Because you don't need an actual diagnosis of gender dysphoria to get testosterone
*  So you just go in and get it you don't need the diagnosis in England where you where you have a centralized medical care
*  And there you do need a diagnosis
*  They know that the numbers are up for a team for adolescent girls are up over four thousand percent. Holy shit. Yeah
*  So you knew all the stuff before you wrote the book this is all the numbers that well
*  It came out in the course of writing it yeah some of it that had to kind of affirm
*  Your idea that this was a real problem. I mean everywhere. I looked it seemed to be a real problem
*  It wasn't and nobody wanted to talk about it, but it's real well
*  It's because like even when we're talking about I'm like, oh, here's a landmine. Oh, here's a landmine
*  Like everything we're saying like if you talk at all about trans people
*  You run the risk of pissing people off and offending people and staying out, you know
*  You you're you're going into an area where it's unless you are
*  100% in support of their decision and their rights and you you you celebrate them
*  You're gonna get in real trouble, right?
*  But that's why we have this problem because nobody will talk about it because parents will call me and say I
*  I've been pro LGBTQ my whole life. I just don't think this is right for my daughter
*  I can't even talk to my friends about it
*  I'll get fired for my job if anybody finds this out, but my daughter's not she's got a lot of problems
*  But gender dysphoria is not one of them
*  Like I don't think this is right and I don't think it's gonna cure her and if you have to work and you're at work
*  All day, you know, how much time do you have to even convince your daughter?
*  Your daughter's with her wacky friends eight hours a day and she's on the internet and the promise her school
*  Her school's already filled out a form calling her Jimmy right for a year. They don't even tell you
*  And for the people that don't think people are easily influenced
*  That's how cults start cults don't start because they make sense cults start because people want to belong, you know
*  and the idea that there's not a difference between someone who's willing to
*  Join some crazy radical cult to belong versus any other sort of social movement
*  That let's that's a lot of what people do
*  I mean people you're seeing it now with a lot of our society
*  there's there's paths that people go on to where they see other people doing it and they see a lot of people getting celebrated and
*  so they go down that path and
*  You know, this is this really is a lot of the foundation of the social media influencer
*  I mean one of the one of the reasons why they're doing that is
*  Because they see other people do it and they see they get this sort of positive reaction from it and then they wind up
*  Saying oh, well, this is the path that I'm gonna go on
*  To make the jump from that sort of thinking and behavior to changing your gender is where people
*  Hesitate they're like she write about this. Is this woman a bigot?
*  Like who are you who are you and why did you write this book? And what is the reaction been?
*  What's the negative reaction been from people who are trans?
*  so
*  You know, I get a lot of positive reaction to be honest parents from all over the country writing me be like
*  Thank you so much. No one will talk about this
*  Let's talk about transgender reaction
*  The best reaction I get from transgender people is that has nothing to do with me and I would say I agree with you
*  This has nothing to do with a normal transgender person's experience. They didn't come up with this online
*  But do some activists attack me yet, but you know biological men
*  Who are trans activists believe that we should not be able to have a conversation about the mental health of teenage girls
*  And they're shutting it down
*  Yeah, why are we letting that happen like who's letting that happen?
*  And what are the repercussions of them fighting against this?
*  Is it what you were talking about before or these therapists if they in any way suggest that this is not a good idea for?
*  The kid they can lose their license. Right everybody. I mean I get so many
*  Doctors will contact me like we live in the Soviet Union. They will say oh my god
*  I can't talk about this
*  But I really you know
*  I have to let you know that what's going on here is crazy and I don't agree with this diagnosis and it's clearly
*  Socially influenced and you know all this stuff and you think like you can't give your medical opinion without getting fired. That's not good
*  Yeah, one
*  This is dangerous, but one of the things that I see is
*  when women
*  Or trans women when a male transitions to being a woman and then enters into women's spaces
*  they do so with the aggressiveness of a male and
*  This is something that a lot of women have been very upset about was particularly TERFs, you know trans exclusionary radical feminists
*  they have a real hard time with
*  Biological males
*  talking about feminist issues and
*  Shutting down discussion about whether or not trans people or women whether or not they should be in these spaces whether or not they should be in
*  These conversations and they do so with a very aggressive
*  Yeah, very aggressive and I just want to say I've interviewed a lot of transgender adults and let me tell you they're not out there
*  To make women uncomfortable the ones I interviewed they want to be happy. They want to be happy. They want to be left alone
*  It's great. Like they're wonderful people these activists are a little crazy
*  You know people who will push into a rest, you know
*  a locker room insist on showering where you've got a bunch of and this happened I wrote about in
*  You know in Palm Springs a girl's you know water polo high school team showed up to
*  Shower in their locker room and there's a full man
*  Showering in the shower and the girls got scared, you know got uncomfortable and he announces he's a woman. He's entitled
*  Yeah, and you can have a penis and be a woman which is also
*  Okay, like you're not even gonna make the commitment like if you're gonna be in a shower with a woman Jesus Christ
*  Like it's saying you're a woman and having a penis and being in a shower with a bunch of women
*  We got to come up with some sort of a way of protecting young girls from people who are doing things like that
*  Where you shouldn't have to see a naked man in a shower if you're a biological female
*  And you know, you're 15 years old and you're you're you think you're showering with your team and a male comes in right?
*  But this male says that they're a woman and you have to take them at their word. Well, you're a woman
*  I mean, we need do we need trans bathrooms? I mean, what do we need? I mean, how does that work?
*  Good question. I mean you can't even nobody's standing up for these girls, right?
*  So few people are saying hold on like you can't they are rewriting kinetic in connect in the state of Connecticut
*  Okay, then now the biological boys are allowed in to outcompete girls. They are mediocre boy runners and they're winning the trophies
*  They are setting records in Connecticut. They are literally erasing
*  Tremendous girl athletes records in the state of Connecticut and they don't have to do anything in terms of transition
*  They just have to say they identify as well
*  Which is crazy. It's not like they have to be on
*  estrogen therapy for multiple years some of them are but you know what the effects of testosterone on the body during puberty on a
*  Male's body are profound. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I know you talk about this like fast switch muscle fiber
*  You know muscle mass bone density. They have bigger hearts men bigger lungs
*  But more oxygenated blood the the you know, differentials profound
*  Yeah, it is profound and it's interesting that if you discuss this you're a bigot it's really weird
*  And it's this denial of reality
*  That it's it's not like you don't want someone to be happy
*  But for someone to say that it's fair for a biological male to compete against biological females
*  That's crazy. And when you have this conversation with people I always say, okay
*  Well, do you think men should be able to join women's teams? No. Well, then what what are we doing?
*  Well, what are we doing if should men be able to compete against women no, okay
*  So biological males that identify as women should be able to compete against women
*  Is that what you're saying because they're still males like when do you make the transition?
*  Like when is it? Do you do you have to and then will people point to outliers?
*  Well, there's some women that have more testosterone naturally and okay, but those are very rare
*  You know and me, you know when one of those gets in your division and you're a woman and she happens to also be a
*  Woman and she has naturally more testosterone. Well
*  I guess you're fucked but that's just nature
*  I mean that's also like if you're my size and you want to play basketball against LeBron James, you're fucked too
*  You know like competitions not necessarily all that fair when it comes to just human bodies
*  Like some people are just genetically gifted and some people are not
*  But we make a distinction for a reason the biological distinction between males and females. It's because men are
*  overwhelmingly
*  Stronger faster have larger hearts more oxygen capacity
*  Bigger bones. There's there's so many factors different shape of the hips, right different
*  Yeah, there's a lot of Alisson Felix, right the world's fastest woman, right this amazing US Olympian, right?
*  So she ran the 400 meter and I think 40 49 point two six sections unbelievable unbelievable time
*  She has more Olympic gold medals than Usain Bolt. Okay amazing athlete in
*  2018 300 boys in high school in America could beat her
*  That's nuts, yeah
*  It's unfortunate because
*  Outside of athletic competition, I would like them to be recognized as a full woman. I would like that
*  I would love it if everybody just treated them like they're a woman and
*  Respected them with their new name or whatever they want to do
*  But when you get involved in athletic competition where I took a lot of heat was when it was about mixed martial arts
*  where there was a mixed martial arts fighter who
*  Transitioned and there was just a story written about it the other day was
*  ridiculous story saying that the science
*  protesting it is junk science, which is horse shit and
*  This person was a male for 30 years
*  Became a woman for two started beating the fuck out of women without telling them that she had been a male
*  most of her life and
*  And people were so that was where I really realized that's when I first started to realize that there's some crazy
*  Psychological connection to this there's like the the the arguments that people have these progressive arguments
*  They're they're saying these things not necessarily because they've objectively
*  Rationally dissected this problem and looked at it in terms of pros and cons and what's really happening
*  Now they looked at it from an ideological standpoint in a very rigid one
*  Like if you want to be accepted by progressive people that is a woman always a woman
*  Like I this was back when I used to talk to people on Twitter
*  But I had this one conversation with this woman and she said that she was always a woman and I said no
*  She was a man for 30 years and she goes no she was always a woman
*  I said even when she got a woman pregnant and had a baby she was yes even then I'm like well
*  We're done because that doesn't make any sense. We're in La La Land, right?
*  Whatever your ideology women are getting beaten to a pulp by Fallon Fox. Yeah, right. They were well
*  They were but you know, I mean look who's standing up for women. That's the problem
*  Biological women get fucked because the idea is that trans women in this
*  Olympics of oppression trans women are they're deemed
*  Higher on the scale. They're more oppressed and more marginalized than biological women
*  So biological women get fucked over in this design because so few people are trans
*  This person can do this and everyone can celebrate and if you're not competing against her
*  So what like no one has a stake in the game?
*  So they they don't really they don't really care and the women that fought her without knowing see I'm in full support of people
*  Fighting her if they know that she used to be a man if that's what you want to do
*  I'm in full support of people skydiving riding bulls go you want to jump motocross bikes and do flips do whatever the fuck you want
*  But you should know what you're getting into, you know
*  If you show up to go on a pony ride and someone puts you on a bull that that seems that's not good
*  You should know that you're about to get on a bull if you think you're gonna fight a biological female
*  It turns out to be a man who was a man for 30 years and then transitioned to be a female and
*  Has been on natural male hormones all throughout puberty all through his life and then becomes a she
*  Now you're gonna fight her and they're not gonna tell you that's crazy. Look at Martina Navratilova. She got canceled, right?
*  Yes, she lost her sponsorship for saying it's not fair for biological men to compete with women in sports
*  But what sponsorship was it athlete ally? Well, who the fuck is athlete ally?
*  An
*  LGBTQ
*  Imagine right. She's all those things get lumped together, you know
*  Yeah, Douglas Murray has a great book about the mad crowds. I'm in the middle of it right now
*  one of the things that he points out is like
*  Generally the idea of lesbians and gay men being together is kind of ridiculous. They're so different
*  Yeah, because gay men are like lesbians think of gay men as being like Peter Pan like they're never gonna grow up
*  They don't have to and lesbians. He's like it's like different things
*  They don't necessarily pal around together
*  Yeah
*  I interviewed a lot of lesbians for the book who have really like taught me a lot about just how beaten down they are in the
*  broader culture today
*  Because you know their groups get infiltrated. They have these underground social groups now
*  I've heard this from many lesbians across the country
*  They have underground and the reason they need these vetting processes for their social groups is
*  Transactivists will try to come in insisting their lesbians. Yeah, and that's what I'm talking about men
*  That become women they they retain some of the characteristics that make men gross and
*  part of that is being aggressive and competitive and wanting to dominate spaces and
*  This is some of the things that a lot of these turfs have had a problem with them
*  This is why they became
*  Trans-exclusionary radical feminists because they felt like these
*  Biological males were entering into their spaces with that sort of male energy
*  I mean even the name turf like they don't call them said nobody calls themselves
*  I mean, I guess they do now as a joke, but like that was a derisive term
*  It was like any woman who stood up for women was a turf. Yeah, it's
*  it's it's so weird, you know because
*  You can't say like
*  There's this thing where you're supposed to say a trans woman is a woman
*  can
*  But you're a trans woman. No, but you are right. You were a trans woman, but you're a woman like this
*  There's a weird game we're playing. Yeah, and it's new. I mean, yes, you know what they used to call transsexuals in prior eras
*  They never said they were always they don't lie about their ballot, right?
*  They're very open about the ones I have interviewed many and they're very open about their biology. They say yeah
*  I grew up as a boy. I'm most comfortable presenting as a girl. They don't pretend that history didn't exist
*  Well, this is all because of social media and it's all because if you don't
*  Go if you don't toe that line you experience attacks and if you read those attacks
*  It'll hurt your feelings and so then you adjust and I've seen people do that
*  I've seen people say things that they really believe and then get attacked and then adjust and say something that is more to appease the
*  Masses than it is their actual thoughts on the matter and it's it's hard because they can get fired
*  You know you can get in real trouble. It's so funny. I think you're right about this actually because I really I really do because
*  I think social media has a more to do with suppressing speech than anything else and in a sense because you know
*  It's like these parents will call me and they'll be like, you know
*  My daughter says she's a boy and it's getting worse and worse the more I go along with it. It's getting worse and
*  I'll say to you know, I'll say why don't you you know, tell her whatever, you know
*  They don't want to go along with it and take why don't you take away your binder?
*  Why don't you you know, what would happen if you did this?
*  I'll ask you know
*  and they'll they'll sort of say I can't do that and what they're afraid of in to some extent is
*  Aside from alienating their daughter. They're afraid of social media, right?
*  I mean everybody's always watching they're afraid of the mom. They're afraid of the mom
*  Yeah
*  And also you're not gonna get a lot of support from other people that aren't being attacked by the mom if you get attacked by the mom
*  Here's what's interesting. Very few people will come to your aid because they're worried about being attacked by the mom, too
*  They'll sit back and even though they love you
*  They'll hope you survive the attack but they won't jump into the fray and sometimes I have to say to parents
*  Listen, this has nothing to do with LGBTQ rights
*  Okay
*  If you see your daughter's in harm if you think she's not doing well your parent, right?
*  You don't have to make a policy statement
*  Okay, you can still support every kind of civil rights issue about you know, LGBTQ rights or whatever
*  This has nothing to do with it. You think your daughter's in harm's way you can protect her. That's your job as a parent
*  Well, it's also we're denying the nuances of psychology that people are malleable and there's a lot going on there
*  There's a lot. I mean people are not binary. It's not one or a zero. You're this or that you're happier
*  You're not and this is gonna fix it. We just need to inject you and slice off your boobs
*  It's not that's not human, you know
*  we vary so wildly that I think for someone to look at a teenager and
*  Come to this conclusion that you in fact would be happier
*  That should be an arduous process where you're presented with all sorts of opposing information
*  It's almost like you should be at a debate like it should be a like there should be pros and cons presented
*  There should be you know
*  It should be something where you're looking at all life like your future will be
*  Radically different if you take path a versus path B, right?
*  So that's how medicine is discussed at other types of medicine at medical conferences, right?
*  They have a new drug out for cholesterol and there's a conference and everyone discusses the risks and benefits and what are the harms?
*  And what is the percent chance that this could hurt?
*  You know, everybody is open and discussing it and whenever I talk to doctors who you know work around this issue
*  Maybe they're an endocrinologist or whatever
*  They will tell me with that when they attend medical conferences in transgender mental medicine comes up. It is a purely celebration festival
*  Nobody's discussing risks. Mm-hmm. Nobody's talking talking openly about them. They can't
*  Yeah, it's so hard because I've met
*  Female to male trans people like we were talking about Buck Angel before the show was great. I love him. He's a nice guy
*  he's really interesting to talk to I had him on the podcast and
*  That makes sense like he always knew that he should have been a male and then he feels way better and and
*  When you're around him like you get it like totally totally and he doesn't look
*  He didn't do this to win friends. No, he didn't do this because of social media immersion, right?
*  No, YouTube star convinced Buck Angel. Okay, he stands up to all them all the time. Yeah
*  That is also the thing and he uses a term the term biological that they don't like right, you know
*  He uses a biological female biological male. He lives in reality. He doesn't pretend that he was always
*  biologically male
*  He's he's like
*  Have you like as you're examining this have you gone back and forth on this? Have you had like
*  Opinions that you abandoned or yeah. Yeah. So I'll tell you one
*  The one that that I think I really struggled with or I that surprised me
*  Big time was people always try to get me to say it's child abuse to put your kid on puberty blockers and whatnot
*  Child abuse the parents are committing child abuse and I don't say that and I don't say that for a reason because I've interviewed the parents
*  And once you interview parents of be of kids that you know parents who have transitioned their kids
*  You you start talking to them and you realize that they thought they were doing what was right for their kid
*  They were really scared. They didn't know like they're very concerned
*  I mean they're worried and they've been encouraged by mental health by mental health professionals who should have been looking out for the child
*  that if you don't do this your child could kill them could kill herself or himself, you know and
*  That's terrifying and sometimes I'll bring up the risks with them and they won't have heard about them
*  I'll say but you know, just just checking with you, you know, what what about the long term?
*  You know, maybe you're foreclosing orgasm like you're if your kid goes through all this and goes on that, you know
*  You know that to testosterone and then goes, you know gets the surgeries you because they never went through normal puberty
*  They may never experience orgasm. What about that and they'll never have heard of that or
*  You know, we're putting so many capacities at risk
*  well, there's a real problem with
*  The way people are willing to discuss things that they're not willing to in any way address the negative aspects of transitioning
*  And one of the one of the things about hormone blockers that drove me mad
*  Was they were trying to say that you could put a child on hormone blockers
*  Then if the child changed their mind, there would be no problem whatsoever. Well, they've reversed that they've reversed that in the England in England
*  They've reversed reverse in America, too
*  They were very recently there was something that got released where they were saying well, this is absolutely not true
*  Well, this is something that people have said over and over and over and over aggressive people in particular, right?
*  totally neutral intervention just that's what they've said. Yeah, let's hey, let me
*  Relieve you of any of the stress about this because we know that there'll be no problem at all
*  You can transition right back, but you can't that's not true. It'll affect your development
*  That's right and and hormones shower the brain and they don't just that you know, and you know, there's right
*  I've talked to a lot of experts, but I've also talked to parents who were never told about this
*  You know, and so I don't blame them like I just I just if you're a parent like how do you know?
*  Whether your kid is in this
*  Contagion as you put it or your kid is actually trans like how do you know and how would anyone know?
*  How would the person that's transitioning themselves? How would they know right?
*  So there's symptoms in the DSM that have evolved persistent consistent insistent
*  Severe discomfort and a two-year-old and four-year-old doesn't keep his you know feelings to himself
*  If he hates being a boy insists that he's really a girl is punching his you know
*  Penis and whatever it's not something parents aren't gonna know
*  Generalization because people vary widely in the way they they deal with things that bother them, right?
*  So I think that the DSM is a list of generalizations about different mental health disorders and different afflictions
*  I write with that when you're talking about a boy
*  Hating their penis and the way they react
*  They'll let you know not everybody lets you know when they're in agony or in pain or or kids
*  Preschool age kids are pretty in a typical family where there's not you know been abused or mistrust or whatever
*  You know kids pretty much announced in my experience announced almost everything. I mean, they're really open. I hate this
*  Whatever they you know, it's not the kind of thing a parent won't know
*  Hmm, but do you think that kids should be on hormone blockers? I
*  I I don't I have never looked I'm a journalist
*  so I explored I talked to everybody and I explore every side of every issue and I I think that
*  Hormone blockers are really significant interventions. They can be dangerous
*  We don't fully have a handle on the long-term effects, but am I someone who believes they should be totally banned?
*  You know
*  I have never said that I've never taken that position because a lot of psychologists that I really respect
*  Haven't said that a lot of doctors that I respect haven't said that that there's no one they could help could you
*  Imagine that those doctors and psychologists would be in fear of
*  Expressing that they don't think it's a good idea the same way you were discussing
*  Therapists will secretly talk to you about the problems of them expressing themselves. Honestly, right?
*  I mean, this is how I see it
*  Like say there's one kid who could be helped by puberty blockers until I mean
*  I explored a lot of these issues with a lot of people until you know
*  Psychologists I respect people who've been very open on a lot of this stuff until they tell me there's no children who could ever be
*  Helped by puberty blockers. I'm not someone who will come out in favor of a ban of banding. I understand but that's that begs the question
*  How would one know whether your kid is the kid that could be?
*  Beneficial that could benefit from puberty blockers versus one who you really should just let
*  Become an adult and go through all the various changes that children go through remember that most kids outgrow this
*  So not right so not doing anything not doing a major
*  Intervention is probably in many cases a totally safe bet in other words
*  You don't have to go in there and immediately
*  I mean part of what's crazy about our age is we think the moment you're in our kids are in distress
*  We need to medicate them. They can never be upset, right?
*  Yeah, we are, you know pushing this accommodation of every discomfort and every right everything our kids say and it's pretty safe to say that
*  There's gonna be a lot of people listening to this that don't even want us talking about this because you're a
*  stereotypical biological female
*  I'm a stereotypical biological male and maybe a lot of people would say this is not even your space to be discussing
*  Right, so I'm not an expert in psychology
*  I wrote about a pure contagion affecting teenage girls and I can't talk about that either
*  You know in which I explore I let the experts talk, you know in the book
*  I mean, that's what I did. I put together, you know studies and I mean like that's what journalists do
*  We just put together the material based on who we interview and what they had to say and their expertise and theirs their research and
*  You know what? It's getting shut down all over the place people
*  I've had podcast hosts write to me and say I'd love to have you on it's too hot. Really? Yeah
*  They'll say to me, you know
*  Basically and what they don't say is a bunch of trans activists are offended that you're talking about teenage girls the mental health of teenage girls
*  Not the activists, right who are mostly biological males. This is teenage girls health. Why can't we talk about it?
*  I mean, I've had my publisher they're trying to get my publisher to drop me. There's a huge campaign for that
*  I mean, it's like, you know
*  You know use this example before but like abortion some people say abortion is just a woman's issue
*  No one else can have an opinion about it and other people feel like people feel different ways about abortions other people feel
*  Wait a second. It's not just about a woman's health
*  It's also the life of this unborn child
*  And so, you know people feel differently like who's allowed to have an opinion on abortion
*  But this issue is that I'm talking about is just about the health of teenage girls. That's it
*  So why can't we talk about what's going on with these teenage girls? Why can't we try to get them some help? I
*  Agree with you, but we're in 2020 people are going bonkers
*  That's really what this is is you have identified something that is
*  That's a real concern when you're talking about the percentage when you said 2% of all these kids are
*  Identifying as trans in high school as opposed to 0.1%
*  Where it used to be so used to be one in ten thousand right now
*  It's two out of a hundred in just in the high school population. Yeah, it's like
*  a lot and
*  Objectively the way you're describing that particular time period in a child's development. It is
*  fraught with peril right right there's so much going on in a girl's life as she's
*  transitioning from being a kid to being a woman and going through all the hormones and all the society and all the
*  All the chaos of school and social stuff
*  Right now it's the hardest it's the hardest period for any woman to go through it's so hard
*  Puberty right except now these girls are being taught in school and they're being encouraged online. You have an escape hatch
*  Yeah, when you you've had some discussions you were talking about
*  Discussion that you had on a television show with other with trans people. How do they react to this? Oh
*  So I haven't been on a the one with oh that that oh
*  So there I was just talking about sports. Yeah, that was not I don't think the reaction
*  That was just for it
*  Athlete who's to trans athletes? Yeah, what were their thoughts?
*  They should be allowed to break world records. I guess something like that. You know, they should be able to compete with women. Yeah. Yeah
*  How'd the host handle it?
*  He who's I think he was a little nervous
*  I mean, you know nobody wants fights like it we're having trouble just having normal conversations today
*  It's crazy except on your show. Well some other people out there too, but yeah, well because there is backlash
*  right and but
*  Again the ones who are getting fucked over biological women and I just think that's crazy
*  I just I don't understand why people are willing to kowtow to the mob like that and girls are noticing
*  Girls know that they have fallen in regard and fallen in status in the broader culture. They know it
*  They know that they can't speak up if they don't think it's fair that a that a mediocre boy athlete just beat them in a race
*  And took the title. Yeah, they know that's not fair
*  They know they shouldn't have to walk that that nobody's protecting them from that, you know
*  Full man in their shower in the locker room. Nobody's speaking up on their behalf. They know it they feel it
*  And so they're they don't think women womanhood is such a great thing right now
*  Well, some organizations are recognizing that it's an issue
*  powerlifting they're starting to ban biological males from competing in women's divisions of powerlifting because they've
*  Literally blown the roof off world records used to be Wow. I didn't know that. Oh, yeah, it's crazy
*  Yeah, I mean there's one who was winning these
*  World records and you looked at her and you're like what in the fuck are you even talking about that?
*  That is nonsense, I believe bench twice or something right well
*  We're talking about squats and oh, wow and prices and Olympic lifts, which are particularly I mean
*  These are really difficult to do anyway and to achieve the type of numbers that these
*  Trans women are achieving. It's their world record number right because they've never had a woman do that before because they really weren't born women
*  Right. So think about how many female athletes you're eliminating
*  They're not just taking the trophy you're eliminating everyone. You're saying that Venus and Serena Williams never existed exactly. Yeah
*  Yeah, it is. It's a very strange thing and it's it's one of the byproducts of being progressive and open-minded and caring and loving like we want
*  These people to find their truth and be themselves and we want them to do that
*  But not at the expense of biological women, you know
*  It's it shouldn't be that way and we're talking about athletics if you're talking about athletics
*  You're talking about physical human bodies and they are different
*  They're different between men and women and anybody who says they're not let me introduce you to a few people
*  Because I know a lot of men that are freaks and they tell me you know
*  A woman looks like that like get the fuck out of here all that so all the like yo
*  El Romero who is one of the top uf's UFC fighters if that guy decided that he was going to be a woman and
*  Transition to being a woman you only gave him two years or whatever you would deal with the most
*  Spectacular woman athlete the world has ever known by far because he's a freak because he's a freak as a male
*  You know and there's that that line that spectrum when you get into
*  male physicality when you get into
*  Strength pure energy the ability to lift things the the difference between men and women is so vast just grip strength
*  Just the average males grip strength in comparison to an elite female athletes grip strength
*  Average male is much more strength and just average guy who barely does anything
*  That's right and and think about like what the heroes for these young girls
*  I mean I grew up in the era of like
*  Worshipping like Martina and Chris Everett and tennis I played tennis and you really look up to these women
*  I mean, they're so strong
*  They're so fast and what if what if all of a sudden not only did you never get to hear about Chris Everett?
*  Because she was beaten long ago by a biological man now you have a man who says he's a woman who's now well
*  How many girls are lining up to be just like him?
*  Yeah, I'm the Martin and Navratilova thing is where it just shows you how fucking crazy everybody's gotten
*  I say that she's anti LBGT like what yeah, she's literally the spokeswoman
*  Yeah, I mean literally like she was she was out before anybody right?
*  I mean, it's we're we're dealing with a really insane byproduct of these times where people are dealing with social media
*  organized groups of people attack people for having divergent opinions and
*  this you know this
*  Need that people have to be loved and not have people attack them
*  So they'll alter their stance on things in order to appease the mob in order to you know align
*  Themselves with the the progressive group think it's real weird
*  Yeah, it's a big problem, and we're seeing whole populations
*  I mean this is this is why this problem with teenage girls got out of hand well
*  It's just you know the sports thing is one thing yeah
*  This seems to be a bigger problem than the sports thing I mean when you're dealing with the sports thing what is the numbers?
*  It's not not it's not a lot of people right it's not it's enough that it's concerning
*  Yeah, it was your child that got screwed over if your kid was going for a basketball
*  Scholarship and also in the biological male was on her team
*  I don't know if you know the story about the 50 year old biological male who transitioned went to high school played college
*  basketball and then transitioned to being a woman and then went back to school as a woman and was in his 50s and
*  playing
*  women's college basketball I
*  Think he was six five he was enormous. I mean see if you find that story
*  50 year old he was more than 50 and
*  Then playing college basketball
*  Competing well now imagine if your daughter is playing college basketball looking to get a scholarship
*  She gets getting she keeps getting stuffed by this gigantic
*  Former dude right who is now on her college basketball team at 50 years old
*  This is women's rights that are disappearing. We're rolling them back right?
*  I mean that when title nine came in right that gave scholarships to young women who worked so hard
*  Who were so talented these are young women?
*  We should be so proud of and their their achievements are being erased right now, and you're right
*  It's not a why it's not yet a widespread social problem right you figure oh
*  Wow, L. Oh L
*  Wow come on. I understand
*  That you want to be a woman I get it I'll
*  Change the name I call you
*  But listen man
*  Our ma'am
*  You can't do this you can't do this is not fair
*  Yeah, and think about all the girls who don't bother going out for the team right they see that and they're like fuck or a girl
*  Who would compete for that position forget it get it? Yeah, she did give up
*  I mean that's a rational to give a body yeah that you know they're gonna get hurt
*  They don't want to get hurt exactly
*  What when you say that you've experienced all this
*  all this
*  What's the best way to describe it the pressure on your publisher?
*  People are angry at you what have you ever?
*  Thought you shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have written this book has it ever been enough of a pain in the ass that you were
*  Like I made a mistake
*  Yeah, I mean of course right I mean I think I you know people like the book a lot you know
*  Thank God they like the book. They're happy. You know it's a good read
*  But do I like all the negative attention? No, I mean I'm not I'm not a provocateur like that's not my thing
*  I you know I'm just a journalist and I looked into a mental health issue and it makes people really angry and do I like that?
*  No
*  but
*  This is how I see it. Okay. This is how I I saw it as I was going through, but I believe this okay
*  What's in this book is the truth? It's a real story. It's a real phenomenon
*  I'm irrelevant if I didn't write this book eventually some other journalists would have
*  So all the anger at me is silly read the book disagree with it
*  Maybe there's some you know maybe you don't think I got something right tell me fine
*  Or don't tell me write an article about it, but if I hadn't written it somebody else would have
*  Because it's it's what's going on it describes a real phenomenon
*  And I think these activists would prefer to keep scaring people to the point where nobody does read this right because they think being trans
*  Should never be questioned nothing about being trans ever should be questioned
*  Right, which is crazy because you know what?
*  This has nothing to do with the activists. It doesn't like teenage girls are in are in crisis
*  They really are and their experience has nothing to do with you know
*  What you know activists are going through and we should be able to investigate it and see if they're getting the mental health
*  They need these these teenage girls, and that's all it does and that's just shouldn't be controversial
*  Yeah, and if this book reaches one
*  parent that can reach one child and show them this book and explain to them that there's something going on that can influence you
*  physically mentally
*  Physiologically you could be very confused and you could think that this is the path towards happiness and cause yourself
*  Irreparable damage and still not be happy. I get calls every day from parents, so I got a call just this week
*  I got tons of calls literally every day
*  So they'll leave my messages open on Twitter in case they need to get you know
*  There are great resources out there fourth wave now parents of our GD kids or there are great resources
*  But sometimes they don't know about them because you know for all these resources need vetting processes now because the activists attacked them
*  So they'll they'll call me
*  I got a call from a woman this week and she was sobbing because parents usually cry when they're on the phone because they're it's
*  About their kid and you know what she said to me
*  She said I feel there's a progressive woman in a progressive city in America totally not religious
*  You know and she's sobbing and she said to me I
*  Can't believe I get my daughter started down this road and I can't believe I get the benefit
*  Because of other parents who went through this who were brave enough to talk
*  I'm so grateful to them. Is there a way that I can do something for them?
*  Hmm, I just thought wow
*  Yeah
*  What an incredible woman like what an amazing like that's who I get calls from yeah
*  And it seems like that's really the only way
*  These people that are going through this with their children are ever gonna get any light at the end of the tunnel is to
*  see that some people have already done this and to learn from the mistakes of the past and learn from
*  These the problems that these kids have encountered
*  Upon transitioning and that this group think
*  Model this contagion as you describe it does happen to kids it happens with cutting
*  It happens with even suicide packs it happens with a lot of weird stuff that right kids
*  Particularly kids that feel like they're outcasts and they're depressed
*  It's it's a real problem. Yeah, there's a there's a great book on this, you know
*  There are a couple there a bunch of really great books of one of them Lee Daniel Kravitz wrote this book
*  strange contagion about these
*  Suicides that went through a community in South Palo Alto
*  So all of a sudden like there are a bunch of suicides in one high school and what's happening is kids are imitating each
*  Other and then you know, they get this idea. Like you said, they're open to suggestion
*  They feel unhappy and now there are other, you know, they know several other kids who committed suicide
*  Maybe I should kill myself. I just failed chemistry or whatever and it becomes a thing in their minds
*  That's always an option and that's what transition has become. It's an out
*  It's the one of the first thing I mean I think about cutting right so I'm in 19 so I grew up
*  1978 baby, so I'm 42 so cutting I missed cutting that didn't exist
*  Okay
*  when I was when I was a teenager
*  But I thought when I heard about it because I heard about it from younger just kids younger than me
*  I used to you know, I would come back from college or whatever here about all this cutting and I and I used to think like
*  Wow, I'm glad I didn't know about that. I was neurotic. I was high anxiety
*  Maybe I would have done that I didn't nobody told me about cutting as like an option
*  But but kids who are looking for a way to manifest their distress they look to the culture and they look to their friends. Yeah
*  What could be done different in terms of some
*  Education or programs or some sort of psychological help in in groups of kids to let kids know in school
*  Like we address all these different aspects of a child's development like mathematics and English and history
*  But we spend very little time addressing the one thing that is probably
*  Most important is how they interface with the world psychology and what what's wrong?
*  What's going on inside of them and knowing what's going on inside of them and giving them some tools to navigate life?
*  This isn't this is not something that gets taught in school
*  Strangely, and this is one of the reasons why they go looking for it afterwards people
*  They're constantly looking for motivation and self-help people and books trying to find some tools
*  So I think that's a brilliant idea. I mean, I never considered teaching kids about psychology
*  I never encountered psychology till I was in college and I think that's an amazing idea
*  The problem is is that these kids are getting indoctrinated instead of you know, instead of exploring a topic
*  They're getting indoctrinated in gender ideology, California starts in kindergarten
*  This is a mandated part of the correct curriculum. You can't opt out of what are they saying?
*  So, you know it varies by class obviously but in you know, they you know, they explore they first they have to introduce the gender
*  Stereotypes and then they explore genders in various, you know classrooms this goes on in California as part of the framework
*  There's a whole curriculum and there are books they supply and they explore, you know
*  What what is a girl, you know?
*  What is a girl body and what is you know?
*  They explore the gender unicorn or the gender bred person and and they teach them that you know
*  Your genitalia does not mean that you're necessarily a boy. You might be something else. You might be gender nonconforming
*  You might be non-binary these kids all know these these terms
*  they know they have every option and
*  The problem with that is then they then they hit 11 and they start to develop and or you know
*  They hit a hard time their parents divorce they move whatever things get hard and these options leap to mind
*  Oh my god. I heard about this. I might be a boy
*  That seems crazy they're teaching kids that that early
*  Well just
*  And and to teach them that I mean like how how comprehensive is this class?
*  I mean how much time do they spend doing this are the parents involved to the parents get to?
*  See what's being taught to them?
*  I never discuss it with them very often parents will ask for the curriculum and not get it and there are all kinds of ways
*  They supply it there's digital libraries
*  Providing California to the teachers and there's all kinds of you know, you know ways that this is taught
*  sometimes it's taught with videos and and they there is curriculum and it's supplied the curricula are usually supplied by activist groups and
*  It's it's very confusing parents, you know parents aren't allowed to opt out of this in California
*  Really? Yeah, because it's not part of the sexual education curriculum that you're allowed to opt out of it's part of the anti-bullying curriculum
*  Whoa, you can't opt out of anti-bullying everybody has to you know, treat each other well, so it's also the word activism
*  It sounds like you're doing a good thing
*  You know like all activism is under the same blanket whether it's you know anti-racism activism or you know
*  gender non-conformity non-binary
*  50 different pronoun
*  Activism and you know, it's a lot of it is indoctrination. It's indoctrination to progressive group think and it's not necessarily
*  What you would really think of when you think of activism you think of the civil rights movement
*  You know you think of the thing of activism you think of positive things and changes that we want to take place
*  but when you're dealing with children and
*  developing human beings and minds and in dealing with an influential person who's standing in front of these people who's older and wiser
*  supposedly and they
*  Tried to bend these minds towards the ideology they support things get real weird
*  And if you're a parent and you're not aware that this is happening to your kid while your kids at school
*  I have a buddy of mine who found something like this out was happening in his school
*  And then he got a hold of the paperwork and he was like he was furious
*  He was like this is crazy. Like what are we doing to children?
*  Has this been vetted is this is this something where we're all in agreement on on this sort of a education process for children?
*  Right, so they're reading books like I am jazz in California to kids and that suggests that you might and it tells kids that you
*  Might have a boy's brain in a girl's body
*  They are being taught this as if this is true, right now, of course
*  There's no evidence that you could ever have a boy's brain in a girl's body
*  I mean, it doesn't make sense, right?
*  But they're taught that alongside things that there that are factual that are biological
*  But if someone is a trans person
*  So if you are a boy who feels like you should be a girl, right?
*  Wouldn't you think that that is how you would describe it? You have a girl's brain in the boy's body. Oh
*  I don't think so. I mean there there are some evidence that there are neurological differences
*  You know that that that you know, it's certainly worthy of study
*  I mean that's open to various kinds of interpretation and and and it's a new area that's being studied and and there may be differences in
*  Transgender people's brains there there might be I certainly would not say that that there aren't but a boy's brain
*  I mean every part every cell in a boy's body has stamped with an XY chromosome, right?
*  So the idea that somehow an XX chromosome to brain got stuck into his head is kind of silly, right?
*  It's sort of more like tooth fairy stuff. Yeah, it would be fascinating if it was true
*  Yeah, I mean imagine if you could run a scan like oh my god, your brains pink
*  Yeah, right now we know what's wrong, right? Exactly. It would be wonderful
*  It was that simple like oh you have a cavity right we can give you a filling right? Yeah, it's um
*  I mean, it's such a hot but button subject and
*  When this gets discussed anytime it gets discussed on this podcast, I mean I'm assuming on any podcast
*  It just people explode and they get so angry about it
*  But where people are getting more and more sensible is when it comes to sports
*  I mean that seems to be where the rubber hits the road. It really does. It seems to be where people are going. Hey
*  This doesn't seem right, you know and particularly like the fighting one to me was like so egregious and so obvious
*  It's I'm hopeful that this is a
*  Transitionary period for our culture and that we realize like yes, you should be kind. Yes, you should be
*  Progressive and open to all these different people that have all these different ways of being and existing in this world
*  But not at the expense of other people and not in particular like let's not pretend
*  That that's six five gentleman who's 50 is the same as your 18 year old daughter who's in college because it's not
*  We're playing games. We're playing weird ideological games, right?
*  No, we are and I think sports is you're totally right
*  I mean Americans are very proud of their female athletes
*  We have been for decades and decades and now you're telling them that none of them would exist today could exist because you know
*  Some we'd let biological men take away their trophies. I mean sports is about bodies. It's not about identification
*  Nobody asks you how do you identify before you run a race? Yeah, it's just about bodies
*  It is and it's it's real clear that they're very different, which is why we have men's divisions and women's divisions
*  What?
*  What is what is it like for?
*  Teenage boys. Did you look into that at all?
*  Are they do they have similar sort of issues with transitioning?
*  Yeah, so teenage boys is a harder case because I think for a few reasons are there boys whose moms will call me and say
*  Oh my god, this happened to my son and it's not real. It's not it does not look like real gender dysphoria
*  He never had it
*  It came all of a sudden because of some trauma or some crisis or it was suggested to him by a therapist right after his dad
*  Died or some story like that. Okay, and I didn't focus on the boys and I didn't do it for a really important reason
*  But but I think it's worthy of explanation and exploration. I didn't focus on the boys because with the girls, it's clear
*  Because we have known for a hundred years that there's a thing called gender dysphoria and it overwhelmingly
*  Afflicts males and now out of nowhere across America and across the West the predominant demographic is not even
*  Is teenage girls with no childhood history? We know that's not typical gender dysphoria
*  So then the question is what is it?
*  Right, but with boys is more complicated because there have always been these boys these males who have had real gender dysphoria
*  So I think a lot more research has to be done in that area and the problem is it's hard to do it
*  Right Lisa Littman, who's the one who did the study on the teenage girls? She's been trying to study detransitioners
*  she's doing big great studies on detransitioners women who regret it because
*  Well all people who regret it, but a lot of them are now women and the reason of course
*  They're now women is because they never had gender dysphoria. So they weren't cured by medical transition
*  So now they regret it and they're called detransitioners, right?
*  And she's already had her study undermined because bunch of people
*  Transactivists on social media said everyone come and validate the study essentially and they all did so they falsified her results, right?
*  Could they ruined the results the story study had to be scrapped and now she's redoing. She's trying to redo it
*  How do they falsify our results? Well, they they took the survey they you know, but they skewed they were able to skew the results, right?
*  They they and she saw on social media. They were directing people to take the study to mess up the results
*  So now we have a population detransitioners that we need to study. We need to learn from and you can't
*  Right. It's hard and that's that's cancel culture right there
*  That's shutting down medical study that will help us understand more about you know
*  gender transition and more about you know gender dysphoria and and also this population of teenage girls and it's hard to even study them
*  Yeah, I was looking at a discussion about there was a particular website that was dealing with
*  Male to female transitioners who then went back to being male again and
*  They were furious at this page and furious at these people for expressing their their story and I was like
*  I was looking at this and I was thinking to myself that's it's so strange that you
*  You're looking at when you're talking about someone who transitions
*  You're talking about a very small percentage of the population that is a male that feels they should be a female
*  to begin with and then you have this surgery and
*  You have this chemical or hormonal intervention and you change your your body and you change who you are and then
*  Regret and then coming back and they were they were so vehemently opposed to this website. I'm like
*  But couldn't you imagine like if imagine a person who's gone through this change
*  So you know that you are very different than someone like Jamie who doesn't have this issue, right? Who's just a man?
*  You know that people are different. So why would you think that there's no way?
*  Anybody could go through that and have regret right because people vary right so much
*  But they were so in opposition to these people's stories and they were so they were saying that essentially this is
*  These people what they're putting this website out was hate speech and this is promoting anti-trans
*  Feelings and thinking and because their line is that detransitioners don't exist or they're so marginal
*  You shouldn't even discuss it exactly except that when somebody a good a scientist in good faith tries to study it
*  They try to invalidate her results. So we're trying to figure out how big a problem is regret, right?
*  And it's hard to know I mean
*  Regret right and it's hard to know i'm just redoing the study but it's it's hard to know and what you just said
*  It's exactly right. Yeah, people have different experiences. Okay, this does not invalidate your experience
*  Exactly exactly and that's the problem
*  And I guess they would point to someone who's anti-trans would point to that website and go see
*  These anecdotal stories of people that transitioned that at a horrible time of it and hated it and went back
*  This is everyone and the other people just in denial, right? Well, that's stupid
*  Yeah, it is stupid. It is stupid. It denies nuance, right?
*  And and also different differentiated people have we know that there are different causes of the same kind of symptoms, right?
*  I use the example in my book. I mean, you know osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
*  Apparently one of the experts I talked to rebe lantern gave the example of they both cause swollen fingers
*  Okay, so you've got two types of people who say they're transgender
*  One who's genuinely suffering gender dysphoria and always has in childhood and another who discovered it on the internet with her friends
*  So now we're supposed to pretend those are the exact same conditions
*  And we're not supposed to look look at them or explore them or figure out what's the difference
*  Now when you present have you ever presented this
*  Discussion to someone who opposes you and how or this argument to someone who opposes you and how do they how do they treat that?
*  Just what you just said right there, which is very very concise
*  Um, I you know, I try i've engaged with all kinds of people online, you know
*  And I always invite people to talk to me in a reasonable way. I can't think of you know, a good
*  You know response that i've well, well, let me think okay
*  So sometimes people will say and I get this and I actually think this is a good response to me
*  They'll say to me, but if you make it harder if your book makes it harder number one people are going to misconstrue it
*  They're going to think this applies to everybody which is a legitimate concern, right?
*  And then somebody who's really gender dysphoric who needs these surgeries won't be able to get them
*  Right, and also they're going to think that everybody would regret and no one's helped by transition and some of these people might
*  You know come to harm because of that. I think that's a legitimate response, right? And it's
*  It's not compelling to me because my attitude is let's discuss it all. Yeah, let's investigate this, right?
*  Let's talk to more experts
*  Let's get more science here and figure out what's going on and by the resistance for you to your book and the resistance to these conversations
*  We realize that people are not looking at this objectively. This is not something that everyone's looking at all sides of it. They're not they're they are
*  Activists, right? They have this agenda and this agenda is very ideologically driven
*  That anybody who even thinks they might be trans should be trans are and the more trans people the better
*  And the more kids that transition the better and then they say but some are gender fluid
*  So the activists will say some kids are gender fluid and you say well, then why would you push?
*  You know permanent hormonal intervention and surgeries on someone who might later decide that they were fine as a woman, right?
*  I mean that you've just acknowledged with gender fluid. I mean this thing is all over the place
*  I have surgeons surgeons will give this surgery. They'll remove healthy breasts for a woman who says she's non-binary
*  Okay, so she doesn't even say she's really a man. She says she's non-binary now
*  Well, wait, I thought the whole point of the surgery was to help this woman because become who she really is a man
*  But now you're saying that you'll give it to you know, 16 year old girls who say they're non-binary
*  The the explant the medical explanation seems to be shifting
*  And if we're supposed to accept people as they are shouldn't non-binary people just be themselves
*  Like why are we introducing hormones into their body?
*  Yeah, why is that?
*  The best approach this is what's so confusing if someone feels they were born a woman
*  Can you just why can't you just be a woman?
*  like why do you if someone feels they're born binary or
*  Asexual or or whatever or gender fluid?
*  Just be who you are. I think in part because of social media
*  Yeah, and part because the the gender ideology in the schools everybody needs their little identity, right?
*  So we're dividing people up like insects, right? Everybody needs their special bucket their special label
*  Well, that was one of the weirdest things about the caitlin jenner thing when she transitioned and then had surgery
*  You know there was an interview where she was saying well, I finally did get the surgery
*  Not that I was wasn't completely a woman before the surgery
*  And I was thinking well, why would you get the surgery then? Well, did she get the bottom surgery?
*  Do you know that's what they call it? So they call it. Yes. Oh, I didn't know that
*  Yes, yeah, she got the bottom surgery, but she was that was her argument was that she was completely woman all woman before that
*  We're in la la land, right? So that's religion. Yeah, right exactly. I mean they're not that's not sign
*  You can't say I was always a woman but then the surgery will make me a woman
*  Right the hormones made me a woman, but I was always a right
*  The surgery makes me a woman, but I was always a woman that you know
*  Court of estrogen every couple of weeks. I don't know what what whatever we decide, you know as as as a group
*  It's very
*  It's very confusing and then people say why do you even care? Like why is this something that you're obsessed with?
*  Well, I care about people and I care about weird shit
*  I care about things get when things get weird when I see teenage girls and I have all daughters when I see teenage girls
*  And I see this issue that you're talking about. We're two percent two percent are succumbing to this
*  I know how awkward it is. I've seen it. I know how awkward it is for everybody growing up growing up is fucking crazy
*  Yeah, I mean you have no idea what the future holds. You don't know if you're going to come out on the other end
*  Okay, you just don't know that's exactly right and adults have forgotten
*  They've started treating these kids like prophets. It's like the moment they say they're trans it's like oh everyone stop what you're doing
*  Forget that she's 13 years old
*  Listen to the prophet whatever she says about herself must be correct
*  That is a great way to put it that is a great way to put it because yeah when I was 13
*  I was a fucking moron, you know, and i'm thank god
*  I never had an idea to change my gender when I was 13, right?
*  it's um
*  it's
*  I'm hoping that over time people realize you can be both
*  Open-minded and progressive and kind and also aware of the pitfalls of a very real problem
*  Yeah, and that's what this seems to be. It seems to be a very real problem that
*  Again, I gravitate towards things people shy away from so people shying away from this
*  I'm like why like why are we shying away from this? Why is everyone so scared of this trans subject?
*  Why is everyone so scared? Well, it's because of social media. It's because of these activist mobs
*  They're not doing themselves any good and they're not doing the the whole idea of being a trans person any good because they make people
*  associate trans people with the types of mobs that attack martina navratilova the type of mobs the type of mobs that go after
*  these studies that show
*  Detransitioners and what their their experience were and fuck up the study
*  And you know what transgender adults reach out to me online all the time and say that they say to me, you know
*  I'm embarrassed by this crazy activist group. I don't want people to say that think that i'm like that
*  I don't support, you know, they're mobbing and I just say that you know, whenever i'm interviewed I say listen
*  This is not you know, the activists don't represent all transgender adults by a long shot
*  You know
*  So, where do you go from here? What's your next book going to be about? I don't know
*  Take something a little less. I don't know flowers. Yeah, right exactly
*  This is my favorite flower
*  Something real easy. I mean you what have you written about before this have you written books before this?
*  No, it's just you know, I write for the wall street journal most often and I write opinion journalists. This is my first book
*  And you know, it's like one of those things like I once I got down the rabbit hole
*  I thought wow, this is really true and I I gotta it's nobody I realized something, you know
*  Nobody could write about I had teachers telling me they couldn't speak up about what was going on in the classrooms
*  I had therapists afraid doctors afraid and I realized if journalists aren't going to talk about this who will
*  Yeah, well, i'm glad you did. Oh, thanks. I really am and i'm glad we got a chance to talk about this
*  And uh, I hope people listen to this with an open mind and just listen to it
*  And this doesn't discount anyone who's trans it really doesn't
*  This is not what we're talking about here. And if you are trans and genuinely trans and happy being trans
*  you
*  Should want people to understand that there's other things going on, right?
*  We're not talking about you. This is a right. This is a condition
*  That young girls are facing as they become adults and going through these crazy hormonal transitions and social transitions and
*  And it and it can damage them. Yeah
*  That's exactly right. Thank you abigail. Thank you. It's called
*  Irreversible damage the transgender craze seducing our daughters and it's available right now
*  Thank you stay offline. Don't read the comments
