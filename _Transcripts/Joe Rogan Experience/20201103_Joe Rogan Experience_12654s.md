# JRE MMA Show #98 with Luke Thomas
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sFl7J3xskY)
*  the Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Hello, Luke. Hi, Joe. We did it. We made it. We finally made it happen. I wasn't sure it was going to happen.
*  Yeah. Well, kudos to you for taking the chance to come here during the pandemic.
*  I know. The all very oppressive pandemic. Well, we were supposed to do it in March. Yeah.
*  And then the world turned upside down. Literally.
*  Basically. But we figured out a way. Yeah. Yeah. It's um, is it?
*  You said you did some traveling. Would you do traveling for before this?
*  So I went to the Charlo Brothers doubleheader in Mohegan Sun, which was interesting because I got there early in the week and the casino was empty.
*  That bitch was slamming by Saturday night. I was not. I'd not been in crowds since March. Right.
*  So that was a bit weird. But so the casino is packed. It was packed.
*  Yeah. Not like not like to the rafters, but crowded. Do they have rules like with masks?
*  It's Native American territory. They make their rules. So yes, they do have the normal protocol.
*  Like there's hand sanitizing stations everywhere. You have to wear a mask.
*  But if you're at the table and you're drinking, they just pull the mask right down.
*  Yeah. I'm like, even if it wasn't that, it's like, can you imagine how fucking dirty those poker chips are?
*  It's like the Excalibur. You ever seen chips of the Excalibur? Holy shit.
*  But anyway, so I was just, you know, I minded my business because it was actually in the Sun, the Mohegan Sun arena.
*  So we would just like beeline to the to the place there.
*  And then last week I went back to Jersey City, which is where the studios are for my showtime gig.
*  So that is interesting that if it's on Native American ground, they can kind of do whatever they want.
*  Pretty much. Which is why the casinos there in the first place. Right.
*  And they again, I would say, you know what? Most people were pretty good about compliance.
*  I did not feel like like honestly, I thought people were more compliance than like the airport yesterday.
*  All these fucking weak, constituted people that pull the mask below their nose.
*  I want to fucking hit all of them with a car antenna. I hate every single one of them.
*  It's not I just want to look at them. It's like it's not a hardship. Just put on the fucking mask.
*  Not only that, if you have it below your nose, you're not doing anything.
*  I was like, just take it off. Yeah. I feel better if you had it off. Right.
*  Because at least you're like, you're an honest broker in this exchange. You know what I mean?
*  But so it was fine. You know, they tested us a bunch of times. We were there.
*  Have you seen the new things like these new hazmat suits they're selling?
*  Like it's literally like go to John Joseph, John Joseph, Kro Mag. Go to his Instagram page.
*  Do you know John Joseph? I do not. Forgive me. He was his lead singer of the Kro Mags.
*  He's also a triathlete. Okay. You know, he is a firm believer in strengthening your own immune system.
*  Yeah. Yeah. He said for that. Look at this. Look at this. Holy mother of Jesus.
*  We're we're in space. I mean, this is this is the future.
*  And it apparently has some fog proof attachment some way somehow or another.
*  And you put your hand if you have to scratch your face, there's little zips on the side.
*  You put your hand through. You know, I appreciate the spirit of innovation here,
*  but this is a black mirror episode. It is. It is. It is.
*  Well, you know, you talk how many people do you know that have gotten it? A bunch. Yeah, me too.
*  Jamie's the latest Jamie. But they're saying it's which was which is very interesting.
*  They're saying it really depends upon what kind of dose you're getting. Right.
*  You obviously got a very mild dose. You had a very mild case of it.
*  That's why the masks are important, right? Because even if you get it, someone has it, you know,
*  they're not wearing it properly. You're not getting sprayed with this huge amount, especially if someone sneezes on you or something.
*  Or that's the thing with drunks. Like bars or super spreader events, right? Because everyone's like drunk talk.
*  That's what I miss. I miss the bars a little bit. I miss the movie theater and I miss the bar.
*  And I'm not like, you know, till 4 a.m. I got a kid. But, you know, just saddling up a little bit, having a couple of cocktails.
*  Yes, I miss that a little bit, to be honest with you. I did. Well, me too.
*  I just got through sober October. I've had it. Hey, it's November 2nd. Yeah. You want a drink?
*  I'll drink. I was going to lift after this, but I'll have a drink if you have a couple of drinks and still lift.
*  That's it. Listen, I'm 40. I can have a couple of drinks and think right, much less lift weights. But I'll try. I'll try.
*  But you know what? You never gets talked about. I deserve to be mentioned here. Send in some whiskey.
*  I know a guy who was a an ER doctor in New York and he's still there now, obviously, but through March.
*  This doesn't get talked about, but it's worth mentioning. There is.
*  So I knew a bunch of people that went to Iraq because I was in the Marine Corps, but I got out right before our unit sent.
*  So I was very, very lucky in that regard. But a bunch of them came back super fucked up.
*  You know, they're all fine now, but super fucked up. These doctors who were in New York in March, they all have PTSD watching day after day.
*  Remember, there was times when New York was losing 800 people a day. And he was telling me like, you know, you hold up enough phones to someone who's dying.
*  And so their kids are crying on the other end of FaceTime. And you do that day after day after day. He started smoking the whole thing.
*  We don't talk enough about that. I don't think it's bad enough now. And he was even saying, like, if you're 25, you're fine.
*  But like all of these at risk folks just coming in and collapsing one after the other, it fucked him up.
*  I can only imagine. You know, this is the also falls in line with the conversation that I've been having a lot about cops.
*  Oh, God.
*  It doesn't people don't understand what it is to be a cop. Like all you see is these terrible videos like George Floyd.
*  You know, just imagine being a person who every day you're seeing suicide, murder, rape, car accidents.
*  You're constantly worried that the next car you pull over is going to be the guy that shoots you in the head.
*  Right. And you've had improper training, probably. Oh, yeah. You're asked. You're asked to do responsibilities you couldn't possibly handle.
*  Yeah. The policy failures of the world are just pushed onto you. And, you know, you had to deal with the dregs of society.
*  Like certainly, obviously, the George Floyd murder is horrific, horrific in every way imaginable.
*  But my stepfather, my mom eventually got divorced by a stepfather for a time. And he was a cop for 30 years in Washington, D.C.
*  You know, I'm not saying he had the most enlightened ideas of the world.
*  But when you spend a few months in the hospital because they broke all your ribs and you had to deal with, you know, two year old with a gun and, you know, every other situation,
*  it will warp you. It will affect your moral calculations. And if you have improper training and improper funding, it only exacerbates the problem.
*  Like we ask cops to do way too much shit and it results in a lot of problems.
*  And the job like now, good luck trying to find really intelligent people that could do other things.
*  You know, right now, no one wants to be a cop because the cops are the bad guys. They're the enemies.
*  And, you know, it's like defunding the police is now like a mantra that the left likes to use.
*  By the way, I'm a member of the left. And so when I first heard it, I was like, I didn't know what it meant.
*  And they like to tell you that it means one thing. I don't think that it means one thing. It means a series of different things.
*  To some, it means actually what they stay, which is what they claim, which is utterly demolish it and start from scratch.
*  For others, thank you. For others, it means not going to that nuclear option, but sort of rearranging funds to go to different policy or other kind of intervention projects.
*  You ice or no ice?
*  It depends on how good the whiskey is there, Joe Rogan.
*  It's still Austin. I've not tried it because we bought it.
*  I'll try it. I'll try it neat.
*  All right. There you go. We tried it when I was doing the... Cheers, sir.
*  Salud.
*  So.
*  Oh, smells nice.
*  It's pretty damn good.
*  That does not need ice. That's good.
*  Yeah. It's a bummer. And you know, it's really a bummer when you see cops scrap and they can't.
*  You're like, how did you get this far? Like you're an actual police officer and you never learn how to... you don't even know how to distribute your weight on the ground.
*  I understand that quite frankly. I was in... I was like I told you, I did six years in the Marine Corps.
*  The Marine Corps has this reputation, somewhat deserve it about their being super macho and shit relative to the other forces.
*  And some of that is true and some of that is deserved.
*  I had never seen... I remember the first time you've been to the Mojave Desert at all.
*  Yeah. So there's the 29 Palms is out there.
*  I'll never forget the first time I went to 29 Palms because there is... fuck all to do at 29 Palms.
*  And so the Marine Corps wisely just invests in weight rooms.
*  It was the nicest gym I'd ever been in in my life.
*  And it was nothing but Haas Marine after... I mean, they're all on steroids.
*  They had to be. I don't think any commanding officer gave a fuck and they were all huge.
*  And they lived this gung-ho life and blah, blah, blah.
*  But then when it came time for hand-to-hand combatives training, McMap is shit.
*  It's not good. It's better than nothing.
*  But unless you do straight up army combatives, like which is a best thing maybe the army's ever done for themselves in terms of
*  that kind of aim, policy aim, you get nothing.
*  And every cop I know who has ever trained, there's a bunch of guys who I know from various different martial arts schools.
*  They took the initiative to go train outside of what law enforcement was providing them.
*  But like, this is what I mean. They don't get any of this shit.
*  Or if they do, it's like, you know, here's how to get out of someone's choking you in this very...
*  It's almost like a women's self-defense class is really the extent to which they learn.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  Yeah, it's not much.
*  It should be mandatory. And not only should it be mandatory, it should be like a part of the curriculum.
*  You know, Jocko Willink said that they should spend 20% of their time training.
*  And I think he's right. I think...
*  Who's got the money for that though?
*  It's a good question. I mean, real consideration should be put to why don't we have the money for that.
*  Also, I would challenge a little bit if I may, which is I saw in the wake of the George Floyd thing,
*  there was a lot of people like, how do we...
*  Most people were basically horrified by that. But the question is, what do you do about it?
*  And so I saw some op-eds. I think Emma Majunki published one from the sky.
*  I'm sure he was well-intentioned, but he was like, I think Henry Gracie had some similar ideas
*  because he really believes in the transformative power of jujitsu, right?
*  I do to an extent. I mean, here's what I would say.
*  It's the same thing going through the military.
*  Like, if you don't succumb to the process, it will not redevelop your character.
*  You have to willingly give yourself to that.
*  Just giving cops jujitsu training does not force that transformation.
*  So while I think it would help in certain situations,
*  it could exacerbate existing problems with whatever cop has deranged or bad training about the world.
*  And now, oh wait, now you know Kimura's and you're a fucking asshole. That's a problem.
*  That is a problem. Yeah, you're right in that respect.
*  If you do get an asshole and you just teach him a few moves, you could create a worse asshole.
*  But I would hope...
*  The problem is, in normal jujitsu, the way jujitsu transforms your life,
*  it's not transforming your life in the stress of you being a police officer.
*  And all the things we talked about, PTSD, people shooting you,
*  dealing with all the horrific things you see every day.
*  You're essentially going through this struggle, and that struggle sort of steals you and makes you a better person.
*  If you went through that struggle along with the chaos of the police academy,
*  or of police duty, I would imagine best case scenario is it alleviates some stress.
*  It helps you get past a lot of the bullshit that you would normally eat at you.
*  And it also allows you to relieve some tension.
*  Yeah, I don't know that I would, for cost reasons, I don't know that I would mandate that kind of training.
*  I think I would offer particular forms of incentives to get it to the right kind of folks.
*  I would mandate it just because you're going to have situations where people have hand-to-hand experiences.
*  You should know how to distribute your weight.
*  Fair enough. But I would say doing that by itself would not be sufficient.
*  That, along with other forms of reform, so that we're asking police to do the things that police are supposed to do,
*  and not the things they're not supposed to do, I think in conjunction...
*  It's never one solution, right?
*  Most problems in the world require a series of interventions.
*  Do those in conjunction, you're probably going to get a better policing.
*  When I was 19, I worked as a security guard at a concert place called Great Woods in Mansfield, Massachusetts.
*  And it was a short amount of time. I wasn't there for about a few months over the summer.
*  But during that time, I recognized a really clear us versus them mentality between the police, or the security force rather, and the concert goers.
*  And it happened pretty quickly.
*  It happened really quickly where I saw security guys beat the shit out of them.
*  The first day on the job, I saw this guy get beaten up with a walkie-talkie because he stole a golf cart.
*  A 19-year-old, fresh-faced kid, like, what is going on here?
*  And this guy, his name is Alley Cat, tackles this kid who had stolen one of their golf carts, and he's hitting him in the face with a walkie-talkie.
*  And I'm like, what kind of job did I fucking sign up for?
*  And it was only like 15 bucks an hour or something. I would imagine. I don't really remember.
*  I remember thinking real early on, like, this is a very strange how I've very quickly developed this us versus them mentality.
*  I've also noticed, you know, back when I was 24, I was working doors at various bars in New York City to make some money to make ends meet because New York City is crazy expensive.
*  And people, and I was lifting weights like crazy. I was huge, you know, the whole bit.
*  And I'll never forget, people would always tell me, they're like, oh, I bet people don't want to mess with you.
*  And I was like, it is totally the opposite. Drunks. Right. If you got a badge on, they want to fuck with you.
*  So a bunch don't. But there's going to be a certain kind of person. Oh, he's big and tall and muscly or whoever.
*  Anybody, you know, you got sleeves of tattoos. That is exactly who they target.
*  There's a certain kind of guy who's like, you know what, I'd like to see what happened if I tried to to ride that ride, you know?
*  Yeah. Chuck Liddell said that, like, when he was in his prime, guys would fuck with him.
*  Not not the least bit surprised. You're like, dude, are you a fucking death wish?
*  What is wrong with you? They have a death wish. Well, some people are just really stupid.
*  Have you ever seen that onion article? It's like average study.
*  Average man overestimates fighting ability by 4000 percent. You ever seen that?
*  Most people think they know if push came to shove, I know a little something, something you don't know.
*  Fuck all. The humiliation of seeing those guys on the mat is really adorable when you see a person who thinks they're fairly tough.
*  Just get manhandled and rag dolled. Yeah, that's the tragedy of modern MMA because there was a time where it was like, is Jiu Jitsu really all that good?
*  And then make videos of some guy coming in being like, I'm going to fuck all these black belts up.
*  And then he goes in there and they wear him out like they work him like a summer job. You know what I mean?
*  For the Gracies, it was like the greatest promotional scheme ever. Amazing.
*  Like to have people come in and fight them. Yeah, come on guys.
*  And they would be pretty gentle with those guys when you really think about it. I mean, they hit them a little bit, but mostly they just strangled them.
*  Yeah, basically. That's true. But we don't really see that anymore because basically the word got out like, maybe don't do that.
*  But it's kind of crazy when you think about the history of martial arts and martial arts were around for since the dawn of time.
*  People have been trying to figure out better ways to fuck people up since they figured out language and figured out how to teach skills.
*  They've been working on techniques right now until 1993. Did we really know what worked?
*  You have a quote. I have an old DVD back when those really mattered. I bought it in, I want to say 2004.
*  So this must have been one of the early editions of like Ultimate Knockouts.
*  And, you know, I think Phil Barone fucking up Dave Monet was on the cover, something like that.
*  And you had a quote and it was maybe it was like 2003. I think that's what it was.
*  So I forget. Maybe it was like one of the Miami shows. Whatever it was.
*  You had a quote and it was martial arts has evolved more in the last 20 years than it has in the last 2000.
*  Yeah. With the exception of weaponry, that is 1000% true. Yeah. A million percent true.
*  And weaponry really like guns. You want to have a weapon, guns and knives and knives been around forever.
*  Swords, I guess, that used to be better at swords.
*  I don't know enough about hand to hand combat with weapons to say one way or the other.
*  But I just know as it relates to martial arts, the fast forwarding that happened from 93 on relative to before it, it was this sort of slow process.
*  And then it hit overdrive.
*  You know, what's really very satisfying to me is that when I first got involved in the UFC in 1997, it was when I was on news radio and the people on news radio literally look at me like I was doing porn.
*  They were like, what are you doing? Like, why are you doing this? Like you're going to ruin your career.
*  And I was like, I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. I like it. You know, my whole life I've been a martial artist.
*  Now, finally, someone did the thing that I've always asked them to do. My whole life I was like, I want to know what would happen if you got a martial artist.
*  What would happen if you got a judo guy with a boxer? If you got a this with that? And then the UFC is like, let's let's find out.
*  And then I'm like, oh my God, it's real. It's happening to me. It was like someone came along with like the Willy Wonka Golden Ticket.
*  Like it was happening. It was real. And then when they offered me a job, I was like, fuck. Yeah, I'm going.
*  How did you get that job? How did they know you did your agent put in a word?
*  My manager was friends with Campbell McLaren and Campbell McLaren.
*  Campbell's amazing. He's a great guy.
*  And he's been on the podcast and Campbell had he had an opening and he said we need someone to do the post fight interviews.
*  And it was very little money. And you have to take a little back little those little buddy Holly killing planes.
*  You fucking fly to Dothan, Alabama. That was the first gig I did.
*  I was actually supposed to be in Albany, but then they kicked it out of New York.
*  And then last minute they moved the octagon to Dothan, Alabama. And I was so happy.
*  It was the debut of Vitor Belfort back when we were calling him Victor.
*  He was they were calling him Victor Gracie. And I was trained.
*  This is when I was training at Carlson Gracie's and they were calling Vitor Victor.
*  I mean, the early posters were V.I.K. T.O.R. Gracie.
*  Like he was Russian or something. I don't know why they call him Victor.
*  Like I don't understand why they did that. But he was using the last name Gracie.
*  And so he was fighting. He fought John Hess over in Hawaii and beat the shit out of John Hess.
*  And, you know, I was training at his school and I thought he was like impossible to stop.
*  And he was 19. And when he was 19, his hands were a blur of light.
*  He was so fast and so aggressive and so different than any other Brazilian jujitsu guy because we thought a Brazilian jujitsu guys and he was a black belt.
*  But we thought of black belts as being someone who just wants to get a hold of you, drag you to the ground, strangle you or get you in an armbar.
*  And all of a sudden you got this guy who's wearing gloves because nobody else is wearing gloves or very few people.
*  Ten Cabot wore gloves and just lighting people up with punches and were like, holy shit.
*  And so just by chance and fortune, I was training at his school and got to be on the card and doing the post fight interviews the very first time that he fought in the UFC.
*  Wow. Yeah. So I got to see him. He fought Trey Tellegman. Remember Trey had a crack and he's a little kid.
*  He could still strike his ass off that guy. He could. He was tough as shit.
*  And he had no idea. No one knew what Victor was. Vitor. I'm going back in time.
*  But we called it. I think I may have even said Victor a couple of times during the broadcast because that's what we called him at the school.
*  Everybody called him Victor. And then all of a sudden it was Vitor.
*  So you had anglicized his name a little bit because no one. I don't know.
*  It's like they call Kamaru Marty. Well, how about Fedor? His real name is Fyodor. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Fyodor Yan.
*  Like no one. It's like Peter. Everybody called him Peter for a long time in the UFC.
*  It was a couple of years. And then finally they were like, oh, it's Fyodor. I'm like, well, I could say that.
*  Why didn't you tell me that earlier? Like they just decided to anglify it.
*  But Fyodor is probably the biggest example of that. Right. Right. Because like Fyodor is not a hard name to say.
*  I'm trying to think that's the biggest example. That's one of them. But he's the great.
*  I mean, if you want to think about heavyweight greats, you've got Stipe, Kane and Fyodor. Those are the three.
*  You got to choose between. And to have the Mount Rushmore of heavyweights, you have to have Fyodor.
*  Yeah. He wasn't some anonymous figure. But you get introduced to him the wrong way. It's hard to undo that. Right.
*  So I got introduced to him in private as Fyodor. Yeah, I'm still saying it. And that will just stick forever.
*  Despite how it actually is supposed to be. I know. If I was friends with him, I'd probably say it right.
*  But if you... You've never met him? No, I've never had him. I've had him in studio.
*  Not the most thrilling interview ever. He didn't give much. He's not there to give.
*  I found that out later. I'm like, I don't think he wanted to be here. No, he's there to give ass-kickings.
*  But to your point about the origin of things, I remember most people were like, I've been watching UFC since UFC 1.
*  Well, I didn't because I just didn't know. I was a 12-year-old kid at the time.
*  You only know what someone shows you for the most part. This is pre-internet, so you definitely only know that shit.
*  I had a family friend who was involved in a martial art that was South Korean called Tukong, which apparently was the official...
*  So taekwondo is, as I understand it, and someone's going to correct me on this, but as I understand it, it was explained to me was that taekwondo was the official sport of South Korea,
*  but tukong was the official martial art or self-defense system of the military.
*  Well, taekyon, T-A-E-K-Y-O-N is what we were taught, was like an earlier version of taekwondo.
*  I don't know anything about it. General Choi Young-hee, he was the guy. I used to teach taekwondo.
*  General Choi Young-hee was the guy who really formulated taekwondo into a system, and my instructor, Jae-hun Kim, was one of Choi Young-hee's original students.
*  So I got real lucky that I got it from the root. I got early taekwondo, rough attacking taekwondo before it was more of a point fighting sort of thing.
*  Well, whatever his background, I can't speak to it too accurately. All I know is that I remember it was the summer of...
*  God, was it 95, 96? Something like that. And he was like, have you seen this skinny Brazilian dude out here fucking people up?
*  That's always how they introduce it, right? And I didn't believe it. And he's like, let's go to Blockbuster.
*  I went down to Blockbuster. It's the one down there by Barracks Row for folks who are in Washington, D.C. listening.
*  It's now a farmer's market or a U.S. market. And it used to be Blockbuster. I went down in there and I got UFC 4 was the first one I ever saw.
*  For me, it was 2.
*  It was 2? Yeah, it was 4. And obviously, he had 4. I think it was 3 he had skipped before he'd come back and fuck Gimo.
*  What was the one where he had... I forget the Genesis, but there was enough in the video where he was just lighting these people up.
*  And he's like, how the fuck is this possible? And it's been politicized now. It takes on a different meaning.
*  But that truly was redpilled at that moment. There was a eureka moment and the lights go on. You're like, wow, this really is the future.
*  It's a bummer that redpill has been politicized.
*  I know, because it's such a great term. Isn't it? It's like you just see Lawrence Fishburne giving you the choice.
*  Yeah, it's been really co-opted because that was the name that Radio Raheem came up with for the... Radio Raheem the boxing commentator, he came up with that for this room.
*  To this date. That guy.
*  Yeah, that guy. Yeah, I'm not sure. That's a bummer, man. The Deontay Wilder stuff that's going on right now.
*  He's released three different excuses. The first one was the weight vest, the thing that he was wearing, the crazy costume, weighed 40 pounds, apparently, and it wore his legs out.
*  The next one was that there was a bunch of people saying that Tyson Fury's gloves weren't attached correctly, so the gloves were extended.
*  So he was hitting them with the knuckles and the glove part was not really attached.
*  So he was catching them with the part that's supposed to be over the wrist. Not correct, not true, and easily provable.
*  The next one he said egg weights. He said he had egg weights, and this is recent, like a couple days ago.
*  Then yesterday there was an article that said that he believes that his water was poisoned.
*  By his own trainer.
*  And Mark Breland was a part of that.
*  Understand, for folks who may not know who Mark Breland is, former Olympic gold medalist, world champion across two different weight divisions, if I'm not mistaken.
*  He is the voice of sanity, or was, until he was dismissed in that corner. That was the guy that threw the towel for him.
*  Breland should be thanked by Wilder and his camp until the end of time. His other trainer, I forget his last name, he was out there at the Post-Fact Press Conference being like,
*  I don't know if I would have thrown that towel. It's like, you fucking yes man. Are you kidding me?
*  Breland took it upon himself to, I don't know, save the guy's life, but certainly make the right call for halting the contest.
*  He was thanked by being dismissed and now essentially dragged through the mud with utterly baseless accusations about poisoning his own fighter.
*  Maybe Tyson Fury is fucking awesome? That seems like the simplest explanation for all of this.
*  Tyson Fury changed his strategy. And also you have to realize that Tyson Fury in the first fight was coming off of a multiple year battle with depression.
*  Mental illness, drinking, got suicidal thoughts. He talked on my podcast about driving his Ferrari and almost slamming into a bridge.
*  He was like, I was peddled to the metal and I was thinking about slamming into this bridge. And then he changed his mind.
*  And he slowly worked his way into shape, got healthy again, got his mind right again and pulled it back around.
*  But when he fought Deontay Wilder the first time, his father didn't want him to take the fight. He's like, you're not healthy enough yet. You're not ready yet.
*  And he did his best. He fought well, but it was a draw. By the time they fought the second time, he was in tip top condition.
*  He had gone through the camp for the first fight. His body was completely recovered from all the abuse of alcohol and cocaine and all the shit that he was doing.
*  And then he took on the cronk trainer Sugar Hill. And then his whole strategy changed.
*  He's like, the guy does not fight well off the heel, off the back foot. Let's move him back. And Tyson Fury is fucking enormous.
*  He's huge. Six-nine. Yeah. And he came into the fight, I think he was like 280. And so he just pressed him and pressed him and just was throwing bombs.
*  And I don't think Deontay Wilder expected that. Deontay Wilder expected him to run and move and jab and fight the same way he fought in the first fight.
*  And instead Tyson Fury just came right at him and just clipped him hard and often. And I think if you go back to their first fight and you look at how when Tyson Fury got dropped in the 12th, rose like Lazarus and then came back, survived and then started winning the round.
*  And then I think he realized from that moment on, oh, the way to beat this guy is to back him up. And then he took that strategy. Sugar Hill, of course, like cronk, legendary, aggressive, attacking.
*  They're like the, if people are MMA fans who love shoot the box, they like the shoot the box of boxing, right? If you think about it, like aggressive, attacking, multiple champions, Gerald McClellan, Tommy Hearns.
*  I mean, the list goes on and on and he employed that sort of attacking strategy. And he's a fucking masterful boxer too.
*  Right. That's the other part about it. I mean, folks don't realize he can play the defensive game. I think you saw it in the auto-vileen fight. He's so long and has such good trunk movement.
*  He can actually lean on the ropes and the punches go in front because he's so tall and long. He can play that game.
*  Well, the Klitschko fight.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  South Box Vladimir Klitschko was one of the greatest ever.
*  Wasn't the most thrilling fight. I mean, the Wilder fight was much better. But I did a whole video on it and I was amazed from the stance he took. He had a little bit of an A-frame stance.
*  So you could say just the way and he was always a double jab away. So he was long enough where he was outside of anything that Wilder could have put together.
*  He was a real one, two kind of guy or, you know, Wilder would just come lunging in with a punch and he was good enough to back him up and then steer him into punches.
*  And I always talk about this Eugene Behrman, who is the, you know, and everyone who gets on me because I'm always promoting city kickboxing. But it's like he's a masterful trainer.
*  It's like, well, not only that, I mean, every once in a while you come around to a guy who not only can train fighters to a high degree, but has an idea about what the game is missing and how to fill that gap.
*  And they are big believers in fainting. They make a point. They basically say like, how is it possible you can have people come from this little tiny island?
*  And, you know, Adesanya is the very best version of that. But like they've got good fighters, Brad Riddell, Shane Young. Dan Hooker.
*  Dan Hooker. They got a lot of guys. And Volkanovsky has trained under Brad, who trained under Eugene.
*  But basically what they believe is that what has been missing for a long time in MMA striking is effective faking and fainting.
*  And that they do shadow boxing drills for hours just on fainting. No punches thrown, just fainting. Just to set it all up.
*  Because they basically say if you look at the way which a lot of American and even European strikers throw, it's a lot of sit down and throw combinations.
*  Which you could do, but they don't really believe that's the best way to do it. The best gap to fill is that.
*  Fury, to circle the point here, is excellent. He is such a brilliant fainter.
*  And he had Deontay Wilder dead to rights over and over and over again, which he didn't really do the first time around.
*  And so, you know, all these excuses about my trainer poisoned me. It's like it's like that's not what the tape shows, bro.
*  Well, he got it. He was making excuses when he got dropped with the first punch.
*  He was like pointing to the back of his head and he was upset and you could see it's like it's really weird.
*  It's really weird when you see a guy who's so utterly dominant and who has what Teddy Atlas calls the great eraser, that right hand.
*  Because it really is. It erases all your problems. You fucked up a little bit. Watch this.
*  All your mistakes gone with that. His right hand is a force of nature.
*  It's one of the best right hands in the history of the sport.
*  Ever. Ever. The Luis Ortiz fight? Like what the fuck, man? What the fuck? Hit him on the forehead.
*  And Ortiz is down like with a look in his face like what the fuck? What happened?
*  And Ortiz is not some chump. He's huge. He's a Cuban boxer, you know, who has great pedigree. One shot set his ass down.
*  And he was winning the fight. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. He was winning the fight. And all of a sudden, bap!
*  If you look at the my view on his power is that for straight rights, which is really what he basically throws or maybe a little bit over handy because it's a little bit looping.
*  That's one of the best, if not the best right hands in all of boxing. If you're talking about full on power punchers, though, I don't know that he's got the full repertoire.
*  Like is his uppercut with his right hand as good as his straight? I don't know that it is. You see, you got like Ernie Shavers. Right. Fuck, bro.
*  Go look up Ernie Shavers highlights on YouTube and then smoke some weed beforehand. You will literally laugh at what he does to men.
*  It's shocking to watch his power and he has the full repertoire of it. Yeah. A lot of fighters have fought him said he was the most powerful punch they ever faced.
*  A lot of fighters. Someone told me I forget who it was, but they got hit by Shavers and then they felt it in the in the roof of their foot.
*  What's the what's the arch? The arch. They felt it in the arch of their like radiated into the arch of their foot.
*  What the fuck is that? I never heard some shit like that. You know what I mean? Yeah. Well, power is a weird thing, right? Like you're the born with it or you're not.
*  I mean, I've seen so many guys who you'd look at and they're big and strong and you would say, wow, but that guy hits hard and they can't crack an egg.
*  There was there's like there's a bunch of them. There's always been a bunch of them in boxing. There's been a bunch of them like you see him in the gym and then you see guys like do you remember Michael McDonald when he was a kid when he was coming up?
*  Yes. Skinny looks like a little boy. Knock people into another dimension and you're like, whoa, this is crazy. Do you follow boxing currently? Yes. Yes. So how about this kid?
*  I mean, you know, I'm not going to say he's a good guy. I'm going to say Jaime Munguia. You seen him? I have not seen him. He fought last Friday night. Holy mother of god. You look at him. He obviously is an athlete, right? He's in good shape. You would look at him and think, you know, I'm not going to say average but there's nothing that stands out about him. At least Wilder is huge. Right. He's bricked up. Makes sense. Munguia is in is in is in fight shape but he's not bricked up and this fucking guy. I mean, he's rearranging. I mean, he is keeping dentists in business. Was he on showtime? He was on
*  showtime. He was on the card of which fight? Oh god. II don't II don't remember. I only tuned in because I was like, I have an alert for Jaime Munguia whenever he fights. Oh really? Yeah. Is that good? Yeah. Uh there's Munguia, the guy on the left. This fuck. Look at him. Does he look like a power puncher to you? Super normal. He is arguably the biggest power puncher in boxing. What? By by way. Arguably. Arguably. Yeah. That's crazy. That fucking guy can crack and I think he rearranges. Oh, so you remember the the lip split that over him had when he fought Rosenstruck? Wait till you see what he does to this fucking guy's face. He
*  does that to the point where a piece of his face goes flying off. This was last Friday. This was just a couple of days ago. Look at that **** Look at that. That was from one uppercut. Oh my god. Look at his face, Joe. It's pretty crazy. He looks like he got attacked by a bear. Now, do they let fights go on in boxing with a split lip like that? No, they called it eventually here. That's interesting because like you remember Robbie Lawler with that crazy split lip when he fought Rory McDonald. But it was right at the end. Interesting. And then,
*  you know, he got hit by a punch to Davis knockout, bro. How beautiful is that uppercut? That was a thing of the same uppercut that Pavetkin used. Uh yeah, a little bit. Similar. That same like if you go and look closely, uh Gervonta is uh squared and so he's leaning to either side and so when the punch comes, he's able to slip this direction. So, he's left handed, Joe. But he is. So, watch. See, look at it. Look how he's square. Oh yeah, he's totally square. So, see how see how that left hand can you go back and pause it for just a second? I want to show you something. Pause it right at the moment of
*  this. If you can. If it if it's at all possible. That's what he's gonna throw here. So, he slips. Now, watch. First of all, the Pavecum one, the arm was extended. So, it came under the arm. This is in front. It's on the inside angle but notice, Gervonta is left handed. He is left hand forward here.
*  So, he's squared and he's, you know how some guys jab with their power hand to like throw people off or just sticking with it? Dan LaHoya. So, he, exactly. So, he sat in square and then gave this guy every inch of a lead uppercut from his power hand.
*  God damn, that was a beautiful shot. Look at that. Al Bernstein got saved too because poor, Al Bernstein's the man I love. Every time I've interacted with him, he's the sweetest guy. He's a great guy.
*  He was about to say, you know, if he was like right in the middle of saying, you know, if Gervonta Davis thinks that his power is gonna put, you know, Santa Cruz down and then he cracked him with it. So, he stopped mid-sentence. Wouldn't have been his fault because the point was like Santa Cruz opened up.
*  He was engaging with the guy. Davis is like, I think he's, what does he got, 23 knockouts? Something like, he's only had one person go the distance. Something insane. Yeah. Which goes back to the Wilder fight. Like, Wilder, Deontay, before Tyson Fury beat him, had only gone to decision two times. Tyson Fury and Dominic Brazil, is that what it was? Brazil he knocked out in the first round in the rematch. In the rematch. Oh no, Berman Stevern, right? That's right, Stevern. Stevern was in the first fight. He beat him by decision. Right.
*  And so, he had been used, and he had gotten so confident towards the end of his career. I remember there's a photo of him walking to the fight or walking through a casino in Vegas. It's an amazing photo. He's wearing a fur coat with an open shirt holding his wife's hand.
*  And he just looks like the ultimate heavyweight champion in the world. You see him like, that is what I want from a heavyweight champion. Just top of the game, just wearing these crazy sunglasses, fully shredded, fur coat, holding his wife's hand. I'm like, that's a heavyweight champion.
*  Connor has that in his head. Connor's the heavyweight champion of the world in his head, you know? Which I'm not bashing him for it. I want that. You should be resplendent and ignorant and amazing all at once.
*  See if you can find that photo of Deontay Wilder holding his wife's hand, wearing a fur coat. It's one of my favorite fighter photos, like getting ready for a fight of all time, because it's so just aggressively confident, just on top of the world.
*  How do you do that? It's almost like a fuck you to everybody.
*  Basically, he was being the baddest man on the planet.
*  I don't think I've ever had that kind of self-confidence ever. You know what I mean?
*  You have to have that to be that guy, right?
*  Especially when he doesn't have the widest skill set. You know what I mean?
*  I mean, literally came into the game. I had the privilege of... That's one of them. Is that the one? This is one where he's got no shirt on.
*  Is it for the first or second of a T-Sign?
*  Oh, now he doesn't have a shirt on. It's just a... Oh, okay. There it is. Yeah, there it is. That's it. There's a few of those.
*  He looks like Mr. T with all the chains, too.
*  Yeah. I mean, come on, man.
*  And you've got a white guy getting your luggage even better.
*  I mean, I'm a fan of his. I really am. And I'm a fan of his as a human being. I really enjoy talking to him.
*  And he told me a story. He's a great interview. He's a great guy. He got into boxing because his daughter was sick.
*  And he was... Spina bifida, right? Yeah. And he's a delivery guy for... Was it Budweiser or something like that? Or Coca-Cola? Yeah.
*  Some liquid. And he was like, look, I got to make some fucking money.
*  And he knew he wasn't going to be able to play in a college sport or in a professional sport without a college background.
*  So he's like, well, I'm going to get into boxing. A year and a half in wins a bronze medal in the Olympics.
*  Like, what the fuck? Just dumb power. Dumb power. Crazy power. Crazy. Like one in a billion human power.
*  But have you ever seen him interact with his kids? Like, the nobility of trying to do that for your daughter is one thing.
*  He's got like a bunch of kids. He's got like five or six of them. And I just had a kid about 18 months ago.
*  I didn't understand it when I would watch. But like, I don't think he's happier than when he's with his children.
*  And there's not even a close second. A doting family man. It's really unfortunate he's made these excuses because as a person, he seems like such a sweet guy.
*  It's a bummer. And I wish someone was there to advise him. Breland. He was.
*  Yeah, I should bring, you know, I don't know, maybe Mark doesn't have the kind of relationship with him that he can call him.
*  My understanding is his manager, John, his manager was the one who brought in Breland years ago.
*  As like a way, like we need somebody here who's like a high level trainer and brought him in. And it worked for a time anyway. But here we are.
*  I talked to Roy Jones about him and Roy Jones was saying if he trained him, what he would train him is he would concentrate on his left hand.
*  He was like, you already know you can put people to sleep with your right hand. He goes, what about your left hand?
*  He goes, I want you keep people at distance. Use the jab. Use the hook. He goes, I would concentrate on just working that left hand.
*  He goes, that would fix so many of his problems because his left hand is just like, here comes the right. Here comes the right.
*  Boom. I mean, he'll throw jabs, but you're not terrified of it the way you're terrified of Roy Jones' left hand.
*  Roy Jones. Have you ever seen Roy Jones' left bicep? Is it the one that splits down the middle like a perfect?
*  He'll show you like his right bicep is like a normal bicep and his left bicep is like twice his size. It's crazy. It's huge.
*  You got the sage north cut bicep?
*  Because he throws so many left hooks. Like he was flexing. He was like, look at this. And I was like, that's crazy. He was like, this one's normal.
*  When you look at this one, his left, look at his left bicep.
*  Yeah, he's got that sage north cut splitter down the middle.
*  Dude, it's enormous. I mean, it's enormous. It's crazy how much bigger it is. Like legitimately 50% larger.
*  Wow. Yeah, no idea. Well, his left hook is just a thing of beauty. When he was in his prime, he barely jabbed people.
*  He would just leaping left hook him and crack him and his speed is his foot speed and his hand speed were so incredible that he could get away with that.
*  I know folks of this modern era, they know the name, but they don't really know what he meant to the game.
*  You know, like if someone asked me who's the modern Roy Jones Jr. in boxing, there isn't one. There's not one.
*  There's one. There's this guy to take risks and liberties and had crazy athleticism and pinpoint punching and showman.
*  He was a showman, too. There's great boxers. Just boxing is in a great place in many ways.
*  There's nobody who does what he did. Roy made world champions look like they had no business in there and people like, oh, he didn't fight anybody.
*  Bullshit. He didn't fight anybody. He fought world champions. He fought really tough guys, but he fucked them all up.
*  I mean, it's the same with Khabib. Yeah. Oh, Khabib didn't find nobody. No motherfucker.
*  Yeah, he makes them look like he they're fighting me. That's the difference.
*  Look what he did to Justin Gage. That's all you need to know. If you say Justin Gage is a nobody, you're crazy.
*  You watch that Tony Ferguson fight. Justin Gage is a fucking animal. Savage. And he just closed that gap and he ate a lot of leg kicks to men.
*  He had a lot of leg kicks that would mean I don't know how many of those you can eat from Justin.
*  Maybe he had like five or six more in the tank. Right. So you're on E. But he closed the gap and then one finishing with a triangle off of his back.
*  I mean, goddamn. A serious question about this because I went through it a couple of times.
*  So from the moment he got kicked and he initiates the takedown, so it was a kick. He tried the first round. He did it off the head inside single.
*  Didn't work. Second round. He tried it off a double from the outside leg kick. First round was an inside leg kick. Hence the inside single.
*  Didn't work. So he goes to the double. It's 22 seconds from that till the finish. So 22 seconds were apart.
*  Twenty seconds later, you're unconscious. I mean, this is my question to you. Is that the best backtake you've ever seen in MMA?
*  Because what he does is when Gage is sprawling in this contest, he's not just sprawling. He is sprawling and turning so he doesn't get pushed into the fence.
*  He was very diligent about that in the Alvarez and the Gage fight. So you can go back and you can watch it.
*  So in this fight, when you see the level change that Khabib hits, you see automatically Gage turn because he doesn't want to get turned that direction.
*  But what Khabib does is he actually scoots under him, pulls him up and then with his head posts him over, gets the hands to plant.
*  Well, once the hands are planted, the double is over. He doesn't care about it anymore. Now he just wants the tight waist.
*  And from the tight waist, he's holding his elbows aren't flared. They're tight here, right? Like he's T-rexing inside.
*  At that point, you have created, if you're Justin Gagey, putting your hands, you've created a stable structure for this guy to now mount.
*  Plus, if you want to escape to the fence to like stand, he can control the ascent.
*  So he goes double turns, pushes hands to the mat, forces Gage down and then with his gable grip, then keeps it there and then replaces it with the hooks.
*  And then turns into a fake, not a real Joe Rogan, a fake head and arm triangle attempt just so Gagey gets his elbows away from his body.
*  Then he chair sits to occupy the space, then throws the leg over and then sits back and takes mercy upon him.
*  As we learn later from Daniel Cormier, rather than arm bar him from his mom's, I'm just going to triangle you because that's the merciful.
*  This guy is out here taking fucking pity on his opponents and he's doing backtakes like that.
*  He is, John Jones to me is the most accomplished fighter we've ever seen.
*  Like the things accumulate over time. No one is as flawless as Khabib Nurmukh Manov, not even close.
*  I think that is the argument, right? Like who is the goat? I think if you look at John Jones's early career, right?
*  John Jones wins the title in 2011 and from then on has fought more fights as championship fights than he has other fights.
*  So he's the most accomplished for sure. Wins the title, earliest youngest guy to ever win the title in the UFC.
*  Beats Mauricio Shogunhua, who's a legend. And then the way he dominates all these other fighters.
*  Up until you get to Alexander Gustafson, you could make the argument that he had a similar career.
*  You could make the argument, like if you look at what he did, John didn't lose any rounds.
*  John was smashing people. You look what he did to Rashad Evans. Look what he did to Rampage Jackson.
*  Look what he did to Lyota Machida. Look what he did to everybody. Everybody he fought up until the Gustafson fight.
*  But the Gustafson fight, then you have to say, well, how much slack do you give him for admittedly not training?
*  Because it was a really close fight. He pulls it out in the championship round, even though he's out of shape.
*  Even though you talk to Greg Jackson, he didn't train for that fight. Didn't fucking train.
*  Like barely worked out, but definitely didn't go through a training camp.
*  Still managed to beat one of the best guys in the division after getting taken down for the first time in his career.
*  Then goes on a tear, right? Beats, look at the way he beat Daniel Cormier in the first fight.
*  Took him down. Like who the fuck takes Daniel Cormier down, right?
*  And then you look at him in the second fight, even though it was ruled a no contest, we know what the fuck happened.
*  He head kicked him and stopped him. You know, it was spectacular.
*  You look at what John has done, then you have to take into account the things that didn't go that well.
*  And we haven't seen those from Khabib yet. You have to take into account the fight like Thiago Santos, right?
*  That fucking goes to a split decision. You're like, whoa, Dominic Reyes. Dominic Reyes thought he won the fight.
*  Right. I did too. Real close. Real close fight.
*  So those fights haven't happened with Khabib yet. And we don't know if they ever could. We don't know. Right?
*  Like right now, would you see flawless victory after flawless victory?
*  You could maybe make the argument that Khabib lost two rounds his entire career.
*  Maybe the second round against Justin. Or the first round rather.
*  Maybe first round rather against Justin and maybe the third round with Connor. That's right.
*  That's it. And either one of those didn't get cut, didn't get dropped, didn't get hurt.
*  To never get cut and to never get dropped, I don't think folks understand what that means.
*  In a sport filled with, it's not a scientific measurement per se, right? Who gets cut the most or something.
*  But in a sport built on unpredictability, on violence, you know, St. Pierre went to wrestling to get away from all of that in large part.
*  And then to never experience that is like, it is shocking beyond description. Shocking.
*  I don't know how to explain that to folks. But to your point, the thing about Khabib where he falls short is that it's just an inevitability.
*  Like your run through 29 fights is the best run I've seen through 29 fights. Ever. Ever.
*  But you know, and John's not my best friend or anything, but I just don't. That is the best total resume I've ever seen.
*  John is the best resume. It's just, it's not, I mean, I know he got, he was getting all salty on Twitter being like, these fucking Khabib fans.
*  It's like, dude, here's what you shouldn't do that. Well, he shouldn't do it. But here's my point to John.
*  It's like, dude, put the keyboard down for just a second. Here's what's going to happen.
*  You're going to go to heavyweight and you're going to probably win. I mean, I don't know. That's a guarantee.
*  Let's assume that you do all of the conversation. Everything that happens right now is just recency bias and could be retired and his father died and was this incredibly sad and like, yeah, inspiring moment.
*  Let the fucking guy have his moment because when you have your moment, all of the, the worm is going to turn.
*  Yeah. And then everyone's going to be like, John's the fucking greatest. He's going to get his just not today at this moment. Recency bias. That's real.
*  Recent bias is that's a real thing. Like, you know, we just watched could be. And then the fact that could be did supposedly retire. Come on, son. Now you want some more.
*  Yeah, I know. I haven't eaten much. So my head is spinning a little bit. That's all right. Everyone asked me, like, when I go on, I was like, are you going to smoke weed? I'm like, there's no chance.
*  I'm smoking Joe Rogan's fucking super weed. There's no chance. I'm smoking it right now. I haven't done anything in a month. I had a couple of glasses of wine last night and I was like, yeah, I'm feeling it a little bit careful.
*  The the John Jones situation is also it's a contrast in personalities. Right. Khabib, who's really religious, very moral, ethical person who doesn't drink.
*  He doesn't party, doesn't do anything. He just trains. He's always in phenomenal shape. He takes every fight incredibly serious. He's never been out of shape. He's never been fat. He's never.
*  I mean, he's missed weight a couple of times earlier in his career, but he got that dialed in. He's he's just so dedicated. Whereas John is a wild man. He's just wild.
*  I mean, you talk about not training for the so excuse me for the the Gustafson fight, buddy. That ain't the only fight he didn't train for. How about what he said to Cormier? I did coke and I still beat you.
*  And I'm like, I don't think he's lying. I mean, the stories I've heard, I don't want to repeat them because I cannot verify them. But I've heard stories like if y'all think that was the one fight he just like, oh, I'm going to take that. I'm going to pump the brakes this time. No, bitch.
*  I mean, here's the other part about it. It's like when you so who's a guy, for example, who maintained dominance of the game and took significant amounts of time off in boxing. Floyd Mayweather would be a great example of that. But Floyd has been training as a family affair from adolescence, right? For the long part of his life. And he is so gifted that he can take time off. And the game is so developed that people aren't going to make warp speed development in his absence. And so they got a little bit better every time he took a little bit of time off like they might have.
*  He's not a first fight with the corkscrew punch. That's a little bit of a wild card there. But in general, he was able to maintain that dominance in MMA. The game changes rapidly, super fast because people are still discovering best practices in two years. People will not be doing the same kinds of things to the same degree they do now. The calf kick and its explosion is sort of an obvious example of that.
*  John was doing things like not training between camps. I mean, that's something only elite boxers do because they've been doing this since they were five, six years old, and they can take the time to not necessarily do that. Whereas most MMA fighters are like, I'm a I'm a everyday martial artist. I just ramp it up. He would do nothing and then something and still go out there and beat world fucking champions in what at the time was the UFC's marquee division. That is out of this fucking world bonkers.
*  I'm going to train. I'm going to beat you as like a part time guy. Yeah. What? Yeah. You just couldn't wrap your head around it. I wonder if maybe there's some benefit to it because it's not like you got totally out of shape. But I wonder if there's some benefit to that and that he's not getting beat up. He's not getting his joints wrecked and you know, there's probably there's a lunch. Yeah, it's a real question of like what is what's the best way to approach it. We're still trying to figure that out. Right. If you go back to the early days of like, say, like Hammer House and like the militant fighting
*  systems guys, like those guys used to beat the fuck out of each other. Kourtiba shoot the box. Talking about those guys beat the fuck out of it was hazing. It was called what it was. Hey, sure. Well, you know, that's a famous story about BJ Penn. Like BJ Penn's crew. Like they would just scrap. They would fight. They would get together in the afternoon. They'd beat the shit out of each other and that would be training. Like, whoa. And you know, that was how everybody did it. And now they realize like, hey,
*  you can't really do that. If you do that, it's going to really fuck with your longevity. But my sense about it is, is I mean, even then in jujitsu to like the old health Gracie school, like you talk to Dave Camarillo or whatever. Those guys back then. I mean, health, you know, savage. They were not fucking around. No, not fucking around. This is not like, hey, you want to get better at self-defense? No, not that kind of school. But my answer to the question about like, is it better to do what John did? My hunch is that there are probably some net benefits to it. Right. On balance, there's
*  going to be some downsides and some upsides. The downsides are going to be that this development that you might need as a martial artist will be somewhat impeded. However, there'll be some longevity issues you may not have to worry about by consequence. In fact, you look at him tearing his toe in the Chao Sanin fight. Now I fucked up my toe similarly. Not to the extent where I was through the skin, but you know, he has a buddy system with the wrap on the toe. And I had to use the exact same thing for a long time because every, even now, if I step on my right foot just right, it's
*  going to send fire through my toe. It hurts like shit, you know? Yeah, John still tapes his toe. He still tapes it. And so my point being is to that extent, he has probably minimized some of the long term impacts. It's just he was so far ahead of the game, so naturally talented, so athletic, he could just get away with it. You could not be average and do what he does. No, you have to be very, I mean, the day he fought Shogun, correct me if I'm wrong, it was either the Betafight or the Shogun fight. That morning, he chased down a robber in Newark, New Jersey,
*  which is, I had worked there one time. It fucking sucks. I was born there. Is that right? Is he born in Newark? Yeah. Wow, Joe, you've come a long way. Newark sucks. Anyway, and he's when he chased down a robber there and the whole nine yards. And, you know, I mean, just things about distraction and blah, blah, blah. And it had zero impact on any fucked. And everyone wants to say, by the way, I don't know if you follow closely MMA Twitter, I'm a little bit more, you know, in the weeds on that kind of thing. By virtue of my media placement, everyone wants to
*  say, Oh, Shogun was washed motherfucker. He was the belt holder at the time. John took it. Yeah, just knocked out the old machismo. What the fuck are you talking about? Was that prime Shogun from the 2005 middleweight tournament in pride? No. But was he some kind of washed afterthought? What the fuck? What kind of revisionist nonsense is this? He was one of the best fighters in the world. Right? Yeah, right. It's hard to say he was washed up just because John comes along. First of all, John opens up with a flying knee. Who the fuck does that? You know,
*  what young kid? What was he? 23? Right? If if if that he opens with a flying knee on a legend. You almost watch it. And here's what he really did at the time. He was just disrespectful. Not like in the fuck you kind of sense, but like I'm going to fight you in a way where like all these stories that they told me about you. It's like the buzzing of flies to me. Didn't matter. He was so confident. He just was a guy who, first of all, when you look at just the genetics in his family are phenomenal.
*  His father is a massive man. Both of his brothers are NFL players, elite NFL players. There's just tremendous athletes in the house. And then they grew up together. You watch guys who grew up with athletic brothers like they all beat the fuck out of each other. Right? Like Matt Hughes and Mark Hughes. They beat each other's asses like that is the case. Like Joe Lozano, Dan Lozano beat each other's asses. There's so many examples of guys growing up with tough brothers and they are
*  fucking hardened. You know, by the time they get into the octagon, this is just like there's there's so many of them like that. I think there's something to that. Right. Having two bad motherfuckers as brothers and like constantly competing with each other. I think. But it doesn't also say something that like, okay, no Gara exception aside, most of the brother tandems or even the sister tandems, one is clearly better than the other, though. Like Matt better than Mark. Right. Valentina, Anthony. Joe better than Dan. Joe better than Dan. Right. The Noguera brothers, I might say
*  that Big Nog a little bit better than Little Nog. Although Little Nog was pretty fucking great. You know, it wasn't like a tremendous difference. But in general, usually one like kind of kind of puts it on the other one for a little bit. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Well, sometimes that is what makes a really tough fighter too. Like Chris Weidman story. Him and his brother. His brother used to beat his ass. His brother was bullying him and Chris Weidman became a fucking savage because he was just so tough from dealing with his fucking brother. You know, like. Do you have any siblings?
*  I only have a sister. Forgive my ignorance. I have a brother. Not the same kind of thing. My brother was a super hardcore academic nerd. And so I don't have any. Like I have a brother and like you're telling me these stories. And it's like that is so divorced from my reality from having a brother as a sibling. Really? We're talking about like a lack of observation. Like parents should be there. Hey, fuck. Stop beating each other up. Like this separate or, you know, probably parents didn't
*  have the time or the there's only so much you can do when you've got. Oh, yeah. Can you imagine if you had Arthur Jones, Chandler Jones and John Jones in the backseat of the car and they want to slap each other? The fuck are you going to do? What are you going to do? I mean, that's some fucking powerful genetics.
*  I don't know if Arthur is still in the NFL. I think he is out now. I don't know if he still is in there, but his brother on the right is Chandler. Chandler, I don't know if you follow. You don't watch team sports, right? No, you're missing out, Joe.
*  I got to get you on it. I hear you. I hear you. Chandler is like a legitimate multiple time all pro. He is the fucking man. He's at the little bit of the latter stage of his career at this point. Obviously, they're all kind of aging a little bit. But Chandler of the three.
*  Well, I guess well, John had a great career, but of the two in the NFL, Arthur had a good career, I think you could say. But Chandler is, I mean, Primo time. Arthur trains quite a bit. Yes, he was a wrestler for a long time. I wonder if he's thought about fighting in MMA now that he's not doing an NFL anymore. I mean, he's probably a better athlete. You know, he doesn't like, you know, he's got the Paul Bwentello syndrome a little bit where they don't look like it, you know, but I bet he can go in there and fuck people up. Well, Fador had that better than anybody. Arguably the greatest
*  heavyweight of all time. And then the second, I mean, the other two besides Stipe is Kane, who also didn't have the best body in the world. Although Kane, he looks menacing. Oh, his face. Yeah. I mean, he's got a big ass fucking head. Looks hard as fuck. I rewatched Kane versus Junior three the other day. God damn it. That's hard to watch. That's hard to watch. He changed. Yeah, he changed him. He changed him. It's hard to watch. You ever seen this documentary? I think
*  it's called The Season. But if I'm getting it wrong, I know your listeners are going to fucking tell me if I get it wrong. Forget the exact name. But they, you know, Steve Mako, he's the ATT wrestling coach. I'm not sure exactly who he is. He was for a long time. Steve Mako is hilarious. I one time, speaking to John Jones, John was fighting Glover in Baltimore and Steve definitely did not want me to interview him. But he didn't say no. I was like, Steve, can I get a couple seconds with you, whatever. And I stuck a microphone in his face and I'm like, so, you know, specifically what kind of strategies around Glover have you trained here? He's like, you know, some particular strategies
*  around Glover for John. Like he would just literally repeat the exact words back to me. Four questions and I'm like, you don't want to do this. He's like, I don't want to do this. It's like he could have said it in front. Anyway, John has an issue with you. You guys have a well, well, real quickly. I'll tell you real quick. It was a funny time where he fucking he sent me to hell on a press conference once. But real quickly, when it comes to Steve Mako, Steve was he wrestled at Oklahoma and then Iowa or I think Iowa first in Oklahoma and they had I think it was ESPN had done a documentary and they had gone
*  to Iowa wrestling is like, you know, if not, Penn State is now the best program in the country and has been for some time because of Kale Sanderson and the recruiting and the great work that they've done. But in general, for a long time, Iowa is sort of one of these titans of college wrestling. And they ask Steve Mako as a college student, why do you like wrestling? Like, why do you want to compete so hard? He's like, because when I really win and I dominate, I change people. They're not the same after I get done with them. They realize they're not who they think they are. And I'm everything that they feared I would be.
*  And he is and he is dead fucking serious about it. So anyway, that was the thing about Steve Mako. So when I put it in a microphone in his face, it was kind of funny. But about John, so I don't know what the issue is candidly. I actually what best I had happening was he had a good at a very good relationship with him and his management for a long time. And I still have a decent relationship with his management. But he had so the fight back with Cormier at two fourteen, I think it was whatever the number was the rematch. He had a press conference. He had shaved head. He was in a mood.
*  And I'd asked him some totally softball innocuous question. And to the public, he goes, you know, look, I don't like you. So I'm not going to answer your question. And it was a shock to me because his coach, Brandon Gibson, I'm like very tight with, you know, and much other people. And they didn't know either. In fact, I talked to his manager, Malki, at the time. I met him at the host hotel and I go, what the fuck was that? Like, it was totally out of nowhere. He's like, you know, Malki, right? You ever talked to him? Yeah. He's like, I don't know. He's like, but you got a big mouth.
*  That's your problem. You got a big mouth. I was like, OK, but what specifically was the issue? He didn't know. And and I didn't get a chance to follow up with John, obviously. And Brandon Gibson didn't know. Nobody fucking knew. So here's my hunch. My hunch is that we were reasonably in good terms. Then he had all those fuck ups where, you know, he got into the car accident and everything else. And I probably said something he didn't like. And I just it's not they don't tell you, you know, they don't call you up. They're like, I really matter to you. They just wait to.
*  So with our opportunity, I had a discussion with John where he was he was thinking, like, why did I go bad on him? Like, what was I saying?
*  Because one of the things that I said that I speculated that maybe one of the reasons why he was behaving the way he was behaving was was was CTE.
*  And I still kind of stand by that. I think one of the things that happens with CTE and not that I think John should get out of the game, not saying this at all, but I'm saying that there's inevitable
*  consequence of getting hit in the head. We've seen the video of John getting pulled over drunk driving and he says, I forget a lot of things I get hit in the head for a living.
*  There's an inevitable inevitable consequence of getting punched in the head where fighters experience some sort of negative effect of it. And some of them become very impulsive.
*  It's just one of the side effects of head trauma and even head trauma that's like acceptable. They get impulsive. They do wild shit. I mean, they do more wild shit. They have a harder.
*  It's harder for them to control their impulses. Well, the case of John, I don't as it relates to my interaction with him and I hold no ill will believe it or not, because frankly, I almost prefer that, you know, because here's what ends up happening.
*  If you get too friendly, then you could hold back. Not even that. A little bit, but that's less my issue. I always tell fighters, I'm not your friend, but I'm definitely not your enemy. You have to understand that.
*  I mean, it's truly you cannot work in MMA media. You cannot work in MMA media. It's not possible to do the job correctly, such as the job can be done correctly, which I'm not sure that's even true anymore.
*  But if you don't understand that the fighter doesn't owe you anything and that the fighter is uniquely disadvantaged relative to the power structures inside MMA, you cannot do the job effectively. You cannot.
*  So to the extent that he gets mad, he's OK. Does he want to answer? He doesn't. He does not. He does not have to answer my question. I'd have fucking preferred a different result, you know, right?
*  In a press conference, I mean, I was like, Jesus. All right. There's a better way to handle this. But but at the end, it's like, you know, I can't tell you how many fighters get mad at me and then won't talk.
*  And like I had intermediaries reach out and be like, hey, man, like, what's the issue? And they won't even tell their friend intermediaries who are often coaches, fighters, blah, blah, blah.
*  They're incredibly sensitive and which I understand. And they're incredibly, you know, they they don't suffer shit gladly, which I also understand.
*  But it's like I've got a job to do. You think I can watch somebody do the shit that John was doing at the time in his life and just like constantly reflexively defend all of it? It's not possible.
*  I have to have I have a job to do. So if he doesn't like that, that's OK. But, you know, what am I like? If that causes a division, then that causes a division.
*  There's nothing I can do about that. Well, I think fighting is uniquely personal, right?
*  It's not like calling it like saying Bill Buckner is a loser because you let that ball go between his legs. It's a different thing.
*  It's a different thing. Like when a fighter loses, it's I almost feel like they put themselves out there more than any other athlete and they deserve more respect than any other athlete.
*  This is my personal opinion. Obviously, I'm incredibly biased because that's the only sport that I've ever covered. Right.
*  Right. But I get why they feel the way they feel. I get it. And I try to be as respectful as possible while still being accurate.
*  And that's a fine line to draw. But I'm an employee of the UFC. You're not. You know, and one of the things that I would love to get into with you, you said that you was the way you phrase it, that they're uniquely disadvantaged in the power structure of everything.
*  Yeah, there's no way to do it. I don't think you can. Like if your job is to cover the sport, your job is different. Your job is to commentate for UFC and then do your podcast.
*  And, you know, my position, I come to it a little bit differently. Right. So for me, if you're looking at the world and your job is to the best approximation that you can tell the truth about it, how do you tell the truth about the world and say that the fighters
*  don't have every power structure pushing against them because they basically do. That doesn't mean they don't act petulantly at times. That doesn't mean they don't bring shit on themselves at times or that everything they do is above reproach.
*  That's not what I'm here to say. But let's sort of let's go through it here a little bit. Right. In the case of fighter pay, the debate is over. It is settled. There is no argument anymore. We now have court documents to this effect.
*  They get paid roughly 18 to 20 percent by the UFC year over year as a more or less fixed position. Now, as the UFC makes more money, 20 percent, the percentage might stay fixed, but the amount of money can go up. So money is going up, but it's relative.
*  It's all a function of this continued amount. 20 percent. OK, that doesn't seem to me quite equitable. That's a personal opinion, but that's the way I look at it. Then you want to look at their management. There are no barriers to entry for management.
*  I cannot tell you half of these guys. Listen, some of these guys I interact with, they're great. I disagree with them at times. I agree with them at times. I think they really have the fighters best interest at heart. But there's a lot of them there that are fucking snakes. That's just the way that it goes.
*  And they are not always acting in their clients best interest. And I don't think the fighters are necessarily the best stewards of understanding what's in their rights and interests. It's my personal opinion. But anti-doping to me is to me, I wouldn't call it a fraud, but I think it's a tragic mistake in the way that we are doing it.
*  How so? Well, in the case of the fighters, they had no say. It was forced upon them. Here's another thing where it's like, to what extent do the fighters support it? There could be high support for it, but we don't know because it's a compulsory demand that they have to give into it. That's the first thing.
*  There's many issues that I have with it. We can get into that. But let me let you go through your list and then we'll come back because there's a bunch of different stuff.
*  So then it goes to the sponsors and then they take away all of them, which is the UFC's right, by the way. It totally is their right. But again, to me, I never understood it from just a pragmatic standpoint because this was a way to offset complaints about fighter pay because you have now Venom at the time or any brand or whatever the fuck that was sponsored.
*  You know, whatever brand that's come and gone was a way to offset fighter pay. So they are restricted. And by the way, the media, I think, doesn't treat them fairly in the sense that, and I remember the MMA media and I have been for almost 15 years, you are expected to be either friend or foe with them.
*  And I don't want to be either. You know, I want to be friendly. I want to be professional. I don't want to be like your buddy because it causes all kinds of problems down the road when shit starts to go south for you. And by the way, it will, you know, every fighter that was young thinks that they're going to live like off these winds forever.
*  And it's like, dude, I've been around long enough to see the downside. It's coming for you, you know. So you begin to add up all of these factors and you can say, well, what is the what is the moment we can create to fix all of this? That is the responsibility of the fighters.
*  It used to be the case that you can make an argument that MMA media was not covering enough of these issues with full throatedness. That is no longer the case. They have aired out all of this. They have covered this multibillion dollar lawsuit that is happening.
*  They have covered. What is what's multibillion dollar? Oh, there's a there's a storm of coming Joe Rogan. So there is a the Nick Quarry, Kyle Kingsbury, Kung Lee lawsuit, but many others as well.
*  They are basically suing the UFC for, to put it in layman's terms, the the the bad effects of monopoly. And they believe they're entitled to compensation and other forms of change in the industry as a consequence.
*  We are going to get a result, I think, on the 19th of this month from the judge in the case that if he allows it to go forward, he will have to certify them as a class. And all indications are he's going to, which means that trial will proceed.
*  Now it still has a long way to go, but that is a major institutional hurdle on behalf of the plaintiffs. I'm not hearing anything about this because MMA media. Right. Yeah. Right. Are you talking about? Oh, like a fucking parrot. Here it goes.
*  John Fitch is in. Yeah, this is it got launched in 2014. Let me can I shout out a couple of people who are tremendous reporters in this regard. There's a guy by the name of John Nash. He goes by the name of you want to follow him on Twitter.
*  It's at Hey, not the face. I don't understand it. He has done absolutely fantastic work and as a professor at Pepperdine, he's an economist, is a professional economist who is a teaches economics there.
*  He goes by the name of at MMA analytics, but his name is I'm blanking out because I've been drinking, but I've had all my show a million times. These two guys and also MMA payout has done a good job of covering this.
*  Josh Gross, to an extent. I know, you know, Josh, Josh has done some good work for the athletic, although he's no longer with them. But these are basically the only folks really talking about it. No one else is really doing it.
*  It's hard to focus on the lawsuit because if the judge denies them class certification or it gets thrown out at any moment, then the whole thing goes away and it's a long term projection. Like we're not in anywhere close to any kind of end on this for the next five years.
*  What is the argument? What is basically that the UFC is not a monopoly is a monopsony, which instead of sort of one seller, it's one buyer. It's a different kind of monopoly and that has resulted in depressed wages.
*  It's resulted in unfair contracts. It's resulted in any number of harms related to the fighter and their ability to negotiate. I mean, most of that is not arguable, right? You cannot argue that the UFC and the fighter go to contract negotiations with equal amounts of leverage.
*  That is not true. Now, what the solution to that is, is very debatable. How do you want to fix that? What kind of policy prescriptions do you want to pass? Do you want to pass the Ali Act and extend it to MMA? There are some problems with that as well.
*  Let's explain the Ali Act to people. The Ali Act is an act that exists in boxing. It currently is a thing. It was passed, I think, by John McCain. I want to say around 2000 or so. I might be getting the date wrong. But basically the idea behind the Ali Act is that it provides a series of protections for the boxer against the promoter and or the industry in the form of disclosures.
*  So for example, by virtue of the Ali Act, they have to disclose to the fighter, to the boxer, like Teofilo Lopez just won, right? Top rank has to disclose to him who's making what, margins on the costs, sales on pay-per-view, or it was on TV. But to the extent that it's relevant.
*  So they have to disclose that kind of thing. The Ali Act prevents any promoter from having the title. So it's a Strikeforce title. It's a Bellator title. It's a UFC title. You can have a problem with the alphabet soup, but that really is the crux of the issue, to the extent that the promoter holds the title. They hold everything.
*  That is a weird issue, right? And it is with Bellator, with Strikeforce, it is with 1FC, with all these organizations.
*  It's a mix between the boxing and pro wrestling model, to an extent. Anyway, I'm not suggesting that the Ali Act is the cure to everything.
*  But yeah, see, because the other thing is like promoters and then the sanctioning body, like then the fighters are paying the sanctioning body and they're paying the promoter and the sanctioning bodies are, you know, they're trying to get mandatory's that nobody gives a fuck about.
*  And then even WBA, like I've been, you know, I covered boxing for a long time, then I stopped because of the nature of my job changed and I didn't have the opportunity to really, I was just so engrossed in the MMA world.
*  I had missed a lot of time. And I remember I was catching up with my co-host for the show I do on Showtime Morning Combat. And my co-host was like, I was like, okay, so this guy has the WBA regular title.
*  And then this one has the WBA franchise title. And then this one has the WBA Latino title. Like, what's the difference? He's like.
*  Do you see what Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr. fighting for? Yeah, like the old man belt or some shit. It's some crazy thing, but it has Black Lives Matter on the belt.
*  Like they're just trying to capitalize on this moment. And I forget what it's called. I forget. But it's some bizarre name for the belt. But both of those fighters are very upset that they're making them fight two minute rounds.
*  We're going to get off of that. Long story short is I'm not presenting to you the Ali, that I'm a huge fan of it. I think it's the cure all.
*  Basically, my view on what would be more equitable. This is my personal view. An economist will debate this. My view is that they should be, there should be a union and or trade association, depending on how you want to view it.
*  And that that will negotiate on behalf of the fighters interests with some additional leverage by virtue of law. The UFC at that point, if they're an actual union, the UFC has a legal obligation to negotiate on their behalf.
*  And so I can, as media, stop fucking talking about how I think the Reebok deal is unfair or the rankings are unfair or pay is unfair. At that point, it becomes the union's responsibility. And then you can just go into that.
*  Does the NBA have a deal with like a particular sneaker brand? Or forgive me my I don't believe so. I believe you're allowed to through the collective bargaining agreement through the NBA certifies all of this. You are allowed to have your own endorsement.
*  The teams might have some kind of individual sponsor. But if you're a LeBron, you can wear whatever the fuck you want. But that's also if you're Conor McGregor, you can negotiate in any way you want as well. Right. There are some carve outs when there's superstars.
*  But here's the key is this. It's like I don't people think that if there's a union, the fighters are going to get 50% of everything, which they would not. It's not true. There's enough the way that they get in boxing boxing purses are on average through the range of things.
*  And again, John Nash has looked at this through the regional circuit. Basically, if you look at the two curves, there is a moment in time in the curve where boxing is less than the MMA fighters. It's that middle class. But before that, and then after that, it's all boxing pays higher.
*  Well, for sure, when you get to guys like Floyd Mayweather, who's the highest paid boxer of all time. But there's no one that's really commensurate other than Conor in MMA like Floyd and really not commensurate because Conor's lost.
*  Right. But let me give you a better example. Two guys who are roughly similar positions in their division, actually from the same area. Regis Progre just fought Juan G. Heraldes on Showtime. He was the number one guy at 140. He's probably number two now. Right. Josh Taylor's probably number one. He got Dustin Poirier. He's number two ish or close in his division.
*  If you look at the Google Analytics, Dustin Poirier is eminently more popular than Regis Progre. It's not even close. He's four or five times to one in terms of how people are interested in what he's doing and looking for him. Regis Progre makes seven or eight times what Dustin Poirier makes.
*  So you have two people at roughly commensurate. Seven or eight times. I mean, I think he made, I have to look at his last, I don't know what he made for the Heraldas fight before the fight where he was trying to fight Josh Taylor. It was orders of magnitude different. I think it was 400,000 versus a couple of million or more. Right. Significantly different. So you can make an argument that there are sections of the boxing world that don't take care of the middle class as well as the UFC. And that is very, very true. Again, I'm not here to make paint UFCs criminals. The UFC is a business. They're going to run it like a business. And the only way to do that is to make it a business. And the only way to do that is to make it a business is to make it a business. And the only way to do that is to make it a business is to make it a business. And the only way to do that is to make it a business is to
*  make it a business. And the only way to fix this is for the fighters to decide they want to do something about it. That is it. There's no cavalry coming. The fighters have to decide. It's going to be so hard for fighters to do that. Because another fighter will come in and say I'll take that fight. Right. And then you have no, yeah. Hence the lawsuit being a bit of a game changer because it could, again, this is very much speculating. It could change the procedure for how this goes forward. It could result, there's a couple of outcomes where it could result in a union or a trade association and then that sort of fixes it.
*  That fixes the problem. Yeah, it's interesting. There's fighters that get to a position where they are world class, where they're challenging for a title. And they never quite make enough money where you feel like it was worth it. Right.
*  Sometimes you read some of the statistics. You read fighter payouts and you go. Right. Here's the thing. It's like you always hear these stories. And Bellator, by the way, if you're asking what percentage they pay out, it's mid 40s. Mid 40s to their. So that's what they pay. Right. Which you could say is like, you know, who pays more. They make less. But they make a lot less. And you can keep your sponsors there. I don't know how much that matters. It matters in some cases. Right. I'm sure it matters with like Michael Vanum Page, really popular guys. Right.
*  Douglas Lima. Douglas Lima. Right. Yeah. Really popular guys. I'm sure it's valuable. This is what I try to explain to people. It's like there used to be this debate because you hear these fighters come out and be like, you know, I got this bonus one time and it wasn't expected. It was huge. And it's like, listen, man, if you've ever been broke and someone came in with a lifeline, it is, I mean, you can't get anything but teared up thinking about it. Especially if you have kids and now you can have a Christmas with your kids. I take what the gesture of money to a person who needs it. I take it very seriously.
*  I mean that. I mean that absolutely sincerely. I really do. But the debate is over. It is not. There is no more debate about fighter pay. We have court documents year over year over year with express intent written in language by UFC to say we want to keep it at roughly 20 percent.
*  And they include the fighter expense of USADA as fighter compensation. That's called fighter compensation. So it's really a little bit closer to 18 or 19. What? USADA is fighter compensation.
*  I'm not. I wish I was making that up. I'm not making that up. Oh, that's unfortunate. So here's my. Please. I've been rambling. I apologize. You brought this. That's OK. Keep going. The last thing I would say is I appreciate the stories of locker room bonuses and helping people out at Christmas. But the fundamental question is, do you if you're a fighter, do you get half of the UFC's money from ESPN? Do you get what kind of cut do you get from pay per view and how much leverage do you have to negotiate that? That is all that matters anymore. And we know what the documents are.
*  What's that? The UFC is obviously a different kind of an organization than, say, boxing, where you just have a promoter and the promoter promotes the fights they promote and they don't have obligations to 500 fighters they have on roster.
*  There's obviously a much higher overhead for the UFC. The UFC runs multiple performance centers all over the world. The UFC has this promotion machine built into it, right, which is very expensive.
*  The UFC has a tremendous staff which they've kept employed even during the pandemic. I never let anybody go, which to me is very admirable.
*  I feel what you're saying. I have always been the person. I'm obviously I'm an employee a long term started for the UFC in 1997 was a different organization.
*  I'm pre Zufa, right? But they they do. They have something that doesn't exist anywhere else where you can go through the system, become a champion and be a multi multi millionaire. Sure. That's not really available anywhere else.
*  Here's the thing. I'm not advocating for a world where we make UFC suffer. The the the the UFC suffering is bad for all of us. It's bad for I'd lose my livelihood. Why would I want that? That's bad for me. You just want the fighters to get a bigger piece of the pie.
*  It's just when it's all over, man, you know, and you see him at the end there and they got shit to show for it. And part of that, by the way, to be clear, if not part of it, a huge portion of it is their own fault. There's no doubt about it. Listen, it bothers me more than anything in the sport. Watching guys at the end is nothing.
*  It's like and then you see what they lost it on. They got scammed or they bought a car and or you know some you know $700,000 Maybach or whatever. You're like, holy fuck. How did we get here? How did we get here? But I'm just saying on some level, it's like with you started, which we've kind of got lost track on. Like when I get up and I think about before I hit publish or whatever, what do I owe these people? What do I owe the fighters? What do I owe UFC? What do I owe the public? What do I owe? Right. And I owe it to the fighters to say there is a situation where they're going to be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. They're going to
*  be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. They're going to be able to do something. So I don't think it's a situation where you could be making more. I do not think it would be 50% because to get that 50. What do you think the numbers was the right number? I think probably around 35 35. It seems like the sweet spot because to get the 50 Joe you have to have a situation where like you play for. picking a Major League Baseball, you play for the Royals and they don't want you, but the Oakland Athletics might want you or blah blah blah and so teams are competing. That is what gets you to 50 right, but if you have just one promoter and you have one union that mechanism to drive pay doesn't exist. What might exist is enough at initial
*  negotiations just push it a little bit higher. Do you factor in all that
*  overhead? Do you factor in all the employees? Do you factor in the machine
*  that's behind the UFC that doesn't exist in boxing? Right, it's hard to
*  parse that because you have to ask yourself to what extent is that
*  kind of vertical integration, right? They want their own hotel which they're
*  building. They want their own apex facility which they have. They want their
*  own broadcast. They want their own, they have UFC fight pass. Like if ESPN went
*  away, UFC just still puts on fights. They have their own, they're gonna have their
*  own hotel. They have their own facility. They have their own broadcast network.
*  With the fight pass, whatever. They have this total, not total, but they have near
*  vertical integration across the industry. And so in many ways that is a great way
*  to keep fights going. But it's like you hear Eddie Hearn who runs matchroom
*  boxing and he always sort of laments, he's like there's got to be a better
*  model that you know the UFC model really has figured it out. But you don't get
*  that if the fighters have rights. You don't get that. You don't get a model
*  where you can have all this extra stuff if the fighters get a significantly
*  greater share. So my answer to that would be I don't know how it will all
*  shake out and I don't know that I have the right answer. I would like a union to
*  decide this. I would like a trade association to decide this. Not me. This
*  is not me deciding it. But I just you know get into a place where it's like oh
*  we can just keep fights going. You do that because you have the leverage to
*  keep it going. When you don't, it's significantly harder. Yeah. Have you
*  talked to someone who has parsed out the numbers, has looked at the expenses, like
*  would it cost to run the UFC? Sure. John Nash has done this extensively. And what
*  is? Through all the court documents. He'd be better to talk about the overhead and
*  how significantly that impacts. I'd be speaking a little bit out of turn. This
*  is a significant factor because it doesn't really exist in boxing in
*  relationship to promoters. They don't really have the staff or the
*  promotion machine. They don't have the amount of overhead. And you have to ask
*  yourself a question. Like in defense of the UFC they're gonna have this you know
*  again let's imagine the pandemic doesn't exist for a moment. They're gonna
*  either have or it's already opened the Institute in China. Right. Right. So they
*  are they are forcing that market to begin to recruit and develop and recruit
*  and develop. And I don't know if it'll be successful but no one in boxing has
*  that kind of hand in the pot to begin to make things happen in the way that UFC
*  could for the betterment of MMA. That's a real thing I give them absolute credit
*  for. It's just you have to decide what you want. Right. Do you want an Institute
*  in Shanghai or do you want Diego Sanchez to have been paid what he should have
*  been paid. Like there's a question you have to ask yourself there a little bit.
*  I want to get to Diego and I want to get to Anderson and I want to get to a
*  bunch of other fighters as well. The argument if I was arguing on behalf of
*  the UFC which of course. I don't mean to put you on the spot for it. No. I'm happy to be put on the spot.
*  I'm never anti UFC. I just I think about the fighters. What do I owe them?
*  Listen man. I owe them the truth. I'm on your team when it comes to fight or pay. Like I don't
*  I don't dictate it. I'm not an accountant. I'm not the guy who gets to
*  decide what the checks are. But I think they should be paid as much as they can
*  be paid. I mean I think it's the fucking hardest job outside of being a cop or a
*  soldier or firefighter or a first responder or a fucking surgeon in the
*  emergency room. It's one of the hardest goddamn jobs on the planet Earth.
*  I don't want to quantify whose job is tougher but it's to me. I am
*  obviously a massive fan and it means everything to me that these guys make
*  as much as they can. But it also the UFC has to be profitable. In order to be
*  sold to someone like WME it has to be valuable. In order for it to be
*  valuable it has to be profitable. In order for it to be something that they
*  can promote and get behind and make it as big as they've made it there has to
*  be some sort of pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for these people. When
*  you're dealing with business folks like you know like the WME. I mean these are
*  big-time players in the entertainment business for them to come along and fork
*  out billions of dollars literally billions for the UFC it has to be a
*  valuable thing and from that people have clearly profited from that stars have
*  been born and when it gets when you get to a guy who's a superstar like a Con
*  McGregor or a Kameed Nurmagomedov or Israel Adesanyo or John Jones they're
*  gonna make a shitload of money. The argument is do the guys below them you
*  know do the journeymen journeywomen do they make enough?
*  Rickel Pennington does she make enough? I would disagree a little bit if I if I may so let's talk about
*  John Jones for a second. Okay. So again not my best friend but I take his side on
*  this one which is do you remember when John was beefing with UFC about going
*  to heavyweight? Yes. He was like I'm retired. Yes. Okay and he was like you know he was
*  asking for Deontay Wilder money yeah he should. I agree but there's no crowds. The
*  problem with the asking for Deontay Wilder money when there's not a stadium
*  obviously you realize that stadiums bring in a significant amount of revenue
*  it's a big deal right I mean it's millions and millions and millions of
*  dollars for a fucking if you you're John Jones you sell out the T-Mobile arena
*  that is a fuckload of money. Yeah but John doesn't see a cut of that. He doesn't
*  see a cut of that but it makes sense that they pay him more because of that.
*  So here's what I would be sympathetic to the argument if the problem was the song
*  was the same pre-pandemic as it was during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic it was
*  the same thing this money is outrageous we don't possibly have it we couldn't
*  manufacture this if we wanted to post or during the pandemic it's the exact same
*  argument. I'd be more sympathetic to it if the song had changed but the song was
*  the same and the other point I'm out here is this if you want to talk about
*  the numbers Deontay Wilder has had what one or two pay two pay reviews in his
*  whole life the first and second fury fights well first one was about 300,000
*  or so second one was about 850 and K and some change then the second one's a very
*  good number but it's like John has been out selling Deontay Wilder on pay
*  per view and this is not an exaggeration for a decade for a full decade he has
*  been logging four five six seven hundred thousand pay per view buys now has he
*  cost the UFC some money with his variety of you know indiscretions
*  along the way maybe but you're asking who sells more between the two and who
*  has sold more it's not even a contest especially cumulative right oh my god
*  it's very easy call here's the question though when Deontay Wilder makes that
*  money everybody's tuning in just to see Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury the
*  undercard makes a fraction a tiny tiny fraction of that whereas the undercard
*  of a huge UFC event you will have four big fights on the card then you will
*  have overall 12 fights usually 11 or 12 you have to pay all those fighters this
*  is what I mean though I'm not asking for the guys to get 50 I don't think 50 is
*  realistic for the reasons you mentioned there is a the UFC has done spectacular
*  well is create a fighter middle class where guys can make six figures a year I
*  don't know how many of them but there's a there's a portion of them where they
*  can make six figures they at least have some accident insurance and there's ways
*  to leverage that and there's a whole lot of them relative to what there is in
*  boxing that's the sweet spot there when you talk about the argument about like
*  who's most underpaid the people point to the guy who's making ten and ten
*  because sob story right but if you're asking who has generated the most versus
*  what they were paid yes for the reasons you articulated John shouldn't be
*  getting whatever he got for do you want to take out for the second walk fury
*  fight no it would be a little bit less than that but relative to what he got
*  no he is Connor McGregor is underpaid relative to what he generates for the
*  company you think he got 50% of that I don't think he got 50% of that I have
*  zero idea I've never looked into it even for a second but when you get to a point
*  where you're talking about like a world championship fighter at least they have
*  the leverage of people knowing that this is gonna sell a shitload of paper
*  what leverage is Connor have let me ask you it's a good question yes no not
*  right now right now I would say he doesn't have a lot of leverage but post
*  Jose Aldo and then post Eddie Alvarez I would say had a lot of leverage here's
*  why Connor's in a bit of a problem one you may not realize this but the UFC
*  over the years they're smart businessmen here you see is very smart what I mean a
*  business is gonna do what a business is gonna do you can get mad at him for it
*  I don't get mad at him for it I understand they took advantage of the
*  UFC didn't break any laws right they took advantage of what the laws were
*  they were smart businessmen I completely understand it but they're very good now
*  about having contractual revenue right so it used to be for example the ESPN
*  pay-per-view deal is a very good example of this where you know if you know as
*  well as I do 2014 John fights Glover may sell okay but not great John fights
*  Cormier it's gonna be much higher numbers and that's still true to this
*  day because star power sells but what cut the UFC takes for how much money they
*  can get is a function it's very volatile by virtue of the star power involved the
*  ESPN deal cuts out a shitload of that one so so for a couple reasons I really
*  am ignorant to the US ESPN so there's a couple of different factors one is to
*  the extent they meet their total quota so that I think it's like 40 something
*  shows a year they get 750 million okay it's a shitload of money that's
*  contracted so you cross the finish line money's yours and they're gonna meet
*  that quite easily this year and good for them I'm glad again the UFC staying in
*  business and doing well everybody wins when that's the case including me I
*  recognize that so that's the first one the second part is what they did with
*  ESPN was they took it away like if you have a cable subscription through
*  DirecTV or Comcast you can't order UFC pay-per-views anymore if you go to ESPN
*  plus the way that works is that ESPN plus or ESPN rather gives them a flat
*  check for every pay-per-view my understanding is this is not confirmed
*  and I hope your audience understands this so double check it it's believed to
*  be around what they would get for a 500,000 pay-per-view by which is where
*  you getting that from again various reports that we've seen from sports
*  business journal weird though like just to come out with a number okay but we
*  were very supports have you ever asked the UFC to substantiate that I asked the
*  guy who wrote the article yeah yeah say again a little bit off the record but
*  there's a reasonable reason to believe it again or double check it or don't I'm
*  just gonna give you what I know okay yeah but that seems like a weird I mean
*  I'm with you on all this but that's a weird one too if you don't have the fact
*  if I'd have not seen the documents myself well here's what I can say for
*  certain they get a stipend for each individual pay-per-view and then on top
*  of that if it sells past a certain point they get a cut of every person they get
*  a percentage of everyone past a certain threshold the Khabib fight sold 500 is
*  that what it's I think domestically plus an additional amount you know what it's
*  sold internationally I think around 150 200 extra okay which is a I mean that's
*  a huge 7 p.m. and you right that's a shitload that's very very good anyway so
*  the point being is what they have done intentionally again quite wisely is
*  they've removed volatility they're gonna have a certain amount of and then through
*  overseas deals with combache in Brazil or European providers they've got a
*  series of contracted pieces of revenue that take out the volatility provided
*  they can meet the overall inventory of content that they have to meet this is
*  very very smart but what it has done is has reduced the amount of leverage that
*  any one individual fighter may have plus Connor pulls out and they go okay Jorge
*  you're on deck and Jorge has just fucking exploded to a megastar and he's
*  all too willing to play ball and so you know he had his own moment but you know
*  they have a ton of different resources to go to so that you fighters think oh
*  I'll just retire I'll just retire and that'll step that'll show them it's not
*  Well the John Jones thing wasn't he contractually obligated to fight like he
*  had a contract for X amount of money per fight and he wanted substantially more to
*  fight at heavyweight because he said the risk was higher and that was where the
*  negotiation broke down. Yeah but why is that why is that crazy that's what would
*  any other person in any other combative sport certainly in boxing what you
*  would get higher paydays for a move up in weight? You would if there was a fight
*  there that would generate substantial revenue you know I think John moving up
*  to heavyweight you could make the look what was how well did Stipe versus DC
*  do the second fight or third fight rather you know that that would be the
*  argument whether Stipe is a big enough challenge for John to to generate X
*  amount of pay-per-view buys which would which would justify the revenue. But this is
*  my point Joe it's like I see your point though it makes sense I'm just trying to say
*  I don't I don't know 600,000 so that's pretty good. Where do you see that? 500,000 oh I'm sorry
*  so again 500,000 for three. Take these numbers with a little bit of
*  grain so that's from topology which is a great site but there these are these are
*  not double checked to some degree well actually you know what some of them
*  might be but the point being is this Joe it's like what is John Jones entitled to
*  here's what I would like it to be I would like to be a case where I don't
*  know the answer to that I'd like to let the Union figure it out like you all
*  fucking figure this out and let it let it go. I feel you on this Union thing I
*  understand the position and like I said I'm always for fighters getting paid
*  more money but it just I don't know if that would ever work. It will work. You
*  think it will work? Yeah. You think it's gonna work? Yes. Really? So you think the future is a Union? How we get there I don't know
*  now that is I couldn't I'm with you it's like their reluctance because I know
*  for a long time you know privately fighters would be like to me they'd be
*  like you'll never talk about this shit you'll never talk about it and I was
*  like you know it's a fair point we never talk about it and then we spent the last
*  seven eight years talking about it and it hasn't moved the needle and so it's
*  like I don't think it's up to me I don't think we can solve this problem you know
*  that's really if you guys want it to be better it's up to you because again UFC
*  is gonna do what they are allowed to do and they're just gonna keep doing it so
*  like for example we had this whole issue with Leon Edwards he got removed from
*  the rankings and everyone was like firing brimstone firing brimstone I'm
*  like dude what do you want me to say man it's their rankings yeah they're gonna
*  do what they're gonna do like either well the Leon Edwards one was weird
*  because like is there anyone that gets less respect for being that good than
*  Leon Edwards like no one is calling out Leon Edwards no one is asking to fight
*  Leon Edwards right like Leon Edwards is a top five guy right easy easy top five
*  he's world fucking class he's supposed to be fighting Jorge Masvidal right
*  after that scrap that they had backstage where Masvidal sucker punched him
*  three-piece in the soda that's supposed to be a fight that gets made right and
*  everyone knows I mean you look at how good he is beats Donald Cerrone you know
*  beats Hafele Dos Anjos I mean he's a world-class fighter and Gunnar Nelson
*  yeah don't forget Gunnar Nelson one of the best jiu-jitsu guys in the division
*  you don't hear his name being brought up it's kind of crazy like for whatever
*  reason he's fallen into this kind of like weird spot where he's really good
*  but he doesn't get the attention I feel bad I feel bad for him Oh Leon Edwards
*  whoo yeah comes out to my of that's that's a big step up for Chumayev that
*  is a big step you know what's funny is uh did you watch the card fuck not the
*  last one maybe two cards ago they had this dude from Kazakhstan you know you
*  know people I don't care where you're from Tennessee or Kazakhstan if if you
*  wear dead animals on your head shit dude you mean business right this dude he
*  beat cowboy Olivera remember that guy yes yes Rachmanov is think is his last
*  name yes and and he guillotine guillotine yeah it's like that dude
*  guillotine cowboy Olivera who is better than anyone Chumayev has fought and
*  there's no fucking buzz about the guy part of it is for Leon Edwards is that
*  and here's the other part like he beat good guys he beat him like on fight
*  pass events or like you know cards that just didn't have a ton of buzz on him
*  and he has good management he's with paradigm which is a big company but up
*  until recently he hasn't done a lot of like vocalization about like he hasn't
*  done he like what was the last time he did like a big interview with a big I
*  don't know man but I hate that that's a factor I hate that fighters have to talk
*  shit it drives me crazy not even that he just doesn't do a lot of talking here
*  he is there is Shavkat Rachmanov look at this fucking animal oh he's very very
*  good very good yeah cowboy Olivera you know is he the best fighter in the
*  world no but he's not a chump by any stretch of the match look at that this
*  guy has a fucking nasty guillotine yeah squeeze yeah and then he goes and puts
*  on dead animals on his head bro look at him you know I mean he's probably
*  directly related to Genghis Khan look at him like that's getting jeans here's what
*  really got Leon you know everyone took an L with the pandemic one way or the
*  other he took a major L sure being in Europe being well he remember so the UFC
*  had that show the I think it was a Sao Paulo show after every sport was like
*  we're done they went down to Sao Paulo and then they were gonna follow it up in
*  London and that's when the world began closing airports and everything else and
*  here was the key man he was supposed to fight Tyrone Woodley mm-hmm at that fight
*  that was gonna be the main event for UFC London and BT Sport shouts to BT Sport
*  because they do an unbelievable job with promotional fighter packages they
*  did one talking about Leon's story being bullied I think his parents could be
*  getting this wrong I believe they're from their Jamaican by heritage or his
*  his family lineage whatever was they have the story about him growing up you
*  know tough situation it was all illustrated like a cartoon and how he
*  had arrived at this position that was his big breakout moment and I think he
*  definitely would have beaten Tyrone which is the current condition that
*  Tyrone is in as a fighter and he lost all of it this is it look at this I mean
*  the BT Sport does such an incredible job look at this thing oh wow yes I was
*  right he's from Jamaica I mean they they show the story and you feel like all at
*  once I don't know who Leon Edwards is but I want to know more I understand his
*  story there's a lot of Jamaican immigrants certainly in the UK and you
*  know growing up hardscrabble and getting fucked up and being in fights and shit
*  and then finally arriving at this moment look at this shit Joe is that
*  incredible that's a great piece and he lost he lost the momentum from all of
*  this well you know the good news is he's still in his prime and once all this
*  shit blows over there's still a lot of big fights to be had at 170 and there's
*  also the opportunity that comes with guys inevitably getting injured and
*  fights falling out and the Chumaya fight if you can shut down the hype train that
*  will put him right in the driver's seat yes Chumaya I mean it's really quick
*  that this guy is all the hype on him and the mere short fight just fucking put
*  a candle on that cake didn't it you ever watch the regional tape on this kid
*  Chumaya yeah he's a monster there was this dude I I was like cuz people like
*  he's just like could be but I'm like let me see fucking striking is a different
*  level exactly so there was this dude he fought in he made most of his fights in
*  brave which is the the promotion of Bahrain and he fought this dude who was
*  a world champion in Sambo no no no no bitch at all like this guy is all dude
*  and Chumaya couldn't take him down like for a full round could not take this guy
*  down and then said you know what fuck it let's strike and punched his fucking
*  lights out like the mere shot he has one punch KO power yeah that mere shot
*  fight and also at 185 that's the crazy thing he's a 170 fighter yeah I mean at
*  170s world-class I think I mean I'm really interested to find out we'll see
*  we'll see with Leon Edwards I might spoke too soon we're gonna find out it's
*  a very very intriguing fight this is the guy I was telling you about this guy
*  he's knocking out is not a chump at all he is very very good
*  fake slow boom oh man yeah he's got legit power and was this a 170 fight I
*  when the guys doing this one one arm frozen up in the air or a leg anytime
*  there's something frozen in the air you know it's a bad knock my my go-to on
*  this is what we call it testifying in church when they throw the hands up they
*  come back and they have fucking slams like the testifying in church the head
*  banging off the ground is always scary you see that Muay Thai ref who caught
*  the head yes isn't that amazing what a humanitarian fuck mother Teresa this guy
*  he's probably a fighter that's probably why it's probably a former but just the
*  agility and wherewithal to like catch the head when you talk about guys that
*  have been KO'd who has been KO'd more than Alistair Overeem but shows less
*  results like less effects of it thinking about that amazing you mean like
*  full-on out well he's been flatlined multiple times he's been KO'd in pride
*  he's been picked KO'd in K1 he's been KO'd like in multiple organizations you
*  look but you look at him he seems fine yeah I talked to him at UFC DC which was
*  in what no about a year ago seems lucid yeah right I mean how even Vandalee
*  Silva is like starting to be the headaches thing Portuguese but the
*  people that I do for that I'm friends with it do speak it say it's a show his
*  the way he communicates in Portuguese is all fucked up now sorry to hear that
*  listen this is how it is you know we know multiple fighters that that slur
*  their words and don't sound like they used to sound Overeem and Bisping
*  Michael Bisping I don't think he's been KO'd as many times but certainly he's
*  had a number of setbacks yeah you got one armed guillotine against Luke
*  Rockhold and the Dan Henderson knockouts pretty bad and whatever like to me Dan
*  Henderson knockout was clearly the worst really really bad but with Michael but
*  both those guys have an incredible resolve in fact you know Michael Bisping
*  I always this is like my sort of like a standard Michael Bisping point is that
*  you know you round three he fought Anderson oh he got yes oh yeah and then
*  if you look at the numbers the best round Bisping had in any round in that
*  fight was the next round he's a fucking animal it's just first of all he got
*  KO'd because he was pointing that he lost his mouthpiece he's trying to get
*  the judge to give him his fucking mouthpiece right and he let his guard
*  down and Anderson hit him with a flying knee right caught him right on the chin
*  and looked like the fight was over Anderson walked away like the fight was
*  over and could have ended the fight but thought the referee was gonna step in
*  and and stop it didn't I think was Herb Dean I believe I might be wrong I think
*  that's right gold standard Herb Dean you know now that John McCarthy's not
*  refereeing that's the gold standard so Anderson walks away and Bisping like you
*  got to put that motherfucker away like there's no quitting that dude zero
*  quitting that guy I don't think folks understand to get when you if you lose
*  enough at something and not that they've lost a tremendous amount I mean he's a
*  Hall of Famer and a champion but I'm just saying at the elite level when you
*  lose like that it is a psychological barrier to overcome it yeah it's not
*  people think it's all we just get back up and well listen we're not this is
*  small potatoes how about the fact that he fought most of the last half of his
*  career with one eye it's just shocking that's what's insane it's completely
*  shocking I mean kind of faked his fucking eye tests yeah and another part
*  is like what would you say is like his ace in the hole as a skill this is just
*  tough just as mine yeah get good everything yeah but like he wasn't like
*  Demi and Maya or whatever he just had a relentless fuck you in your face ability
*  he's tough as fuck doesn't get any tougher I've said it make up here
*  bulletproof totally bulletproof you got to beat him you know he doesn't beat
*  himself I mean the knockout of Luke Rockhold's goddamn sensational I
*  remember being there for that and like seeing the the joy on his face to
*  finally achieved what seemed like surprise a little surprise on that right
*  at first he had that smile like remember he looked around like this like holy
*  fuck yeah I'm the champ yeah I did it yeah and the fact that he KO'd Rockhold
*  with that beautiful left over the top like that and that him and Jason Perillo
*  saw that as a flaw in Rockhold's defense but I mean I think that mean
*  those are an amazing performance clearly the performance of his life
*  because it won him the title but I say you go to the Conn Lee fight the Conn
*  Lee fight he beat the fucking breaks out of Conn Lee and that was when Conn Lee
*  was Conn Lee and Conn Lee was like a scary guy he had these wild taekwondo
*  kicks who throw spinning back kicks and wheel kicks and you know was had a
*  dangerous style hard to figure out and Michael Bisping just beat the fuck out
*  of him at the end of the fight in retrospect I'm a little less surprised by
*  that by virtue of the Scott Smith fights that he had in Strike Force
*  Conn Lee but to your point but Conn Lee in that fight also didn't he test
*  positive I mean I think he was like because he looked super saucy he was fucking
*  shredded yeah he had a beautiful six-pack and then Bisping was like what the fuck
*  is going on here and still which by the way for Bisping is like extra oh yeah
*  well that was the Vitor thing too you know when Vitor stopped him Vitor was on
*  just full whatever the fuck he was on that was when there was a moment for
*  people don't understand this there was a moment of madness in MMA where you were
*  allowed to take testosterone right and all you had to do was show low
*  testosterone well guess what if you've been doing steroids you show low
*  testosterone just get off the steroids and then your endocrine system is all
*  fucked up so you go to a doctor the doctor blood tests uses yep you have low
*  testosterone you need TRT so testosterone replacement therapy is on
*  the menu and then all sudden you go from Vitor Belfort who got front kicked in
*  the face by Anderson Silva who had if you go pull that up because it's one of
*  Anderson's most spectacular knockouts and the first time ever I saw someone
*  get KO'd by a front kick to the face because I remember I had a conversation
*  with Eddie Bravo once in my gym where I had like one of those little rubber
*  dummies that looks like a person and he goes could you throw a front kick to the
*  face I was like yeah you could but you'd have to time it perfect it's really not
*  the best place for it I'm like the place for it meanwhile you know front kick but
*  look at Vitor Vitor then you know he just looked normal this looks like an
*  athlete you know he wasn't particularly shredded particularly ripped now go to
*  Vitor Belfort yeah yeah I mean what in the fucking holy shit you go 2012 was
*  the year he was like super saucy go to Vitor Belfort versus Michael Bissping if
*  you could find that because there was a time where they let Vitor take whatever
*  he wanted and the problem with that is they did a test once and when they did a
*  test on him like look at that picture where they're touching gloves yeah right
*  there I mean he is just fucking jacked Vitor Belfort is proof that no one's ever
*  been like you know what your traps are too big look at that picture like god
*  damn that's making weight right that's that's when you had to make weight that
*  wasn't the unofficial weigh-ins where you weighed in and rehydrated and then
*  you got to step on this you know and I would say the official weight for Vitor
*  Belfort 185 but really he'd be 195 plus right when he would stand at least
*  camera at least yeah but look how shredded he was and that's when he was
*  on testosterone replacement therapy so Bissping fights him all natural and
*  Vitor when he was on TRT is like the best god damn if you want to do an ad for
*  TRT you'd have Vitor during those dominant years then you didn't even have
*  to take steroids to get TRT you could just have a bad night of sleep yeah yeah
*  bad night of sleep or eat by the way if you just ate like a bunch of shitty food and they'd be
*  like yeah go on the low side of things and then you you literally allowed to
*  self-administer and this is where it got crazy because Vitor tested one time one
*  of the reasons why they stopped the testosterone replacement therapy is they
*  tested him one time when he was in Vegas and he was just off the charts and they
*  were like what in the fuck man and then you know they're like he was off the
*  charts for the John Jones fight that's true too yeah and John was upset with
*  that right because well that was a fight at 205 right that was a fight that
*  really tested John Jones medal and that's that's a fight where a lot of
*  people forget John Jones had a fully hyper extended arm bar on him I mean his
*  arm was fucked and most people would have tapped I mean that arm was gonzo to
*  the point where John decided to coach the ultimate fighter because he knew he
*  wasn't gonna be able to train for a long time because his arm was so fucked from
*  the Vitor fight right Vitor in his guard threw up an arm bar and had it fully
*  hyper extended and I think Vitor might have let it go or something I mean I
*  don't know what happened there either John just gutted it out and Vitor got
*  tired but his arm was fucked where if you're watching it you're cringing
*  because you're waiting for that like Frank Mir, Tim Sylvia snap but that was
*  actually low on the arm that was here right on the forearm yeah I remember
*  that god damn but like I donated to Tim's GoFundMe for that did you oh
*  where you get the medal pulled out of the arm fell bad so I gave him some money
*  yeah yeah how crazy is that right world champion and why doesn't the UFC pay
*  for that I'm not sure what the roof of the medical he tried and I think it's a
*  I don't know is the answer I don't know so so what they have to do they have to
*  cut them open take out the plates so apparently the screws were getting
*  pushed out naturally and he was poor you could see he'd pour hydrox what's it
*  what's it what's the clearly hydrogen peroxide and you'd see all the bubbles
*  and shit from the infection oh boy so he had but he I think he I think he got
*  like 15 grand off GoFundMe so I think he more or less got the surgery that he
*  needed but yeah Jesus Christ I know it's like why would you fight why would you
*  fight for a living it's so like well how about Frank Mir you know when Frank
*  Mir got hit by a car when he was on his motorcycle for he's got screws and
*  plates in his fucking thigh his his femur was snapped in half which is real
*  touch-and-go like you could lose a leg there easily because the blood flow and
*  like that that injury is super dangerous like a femur break is really dangerous I
*  know you have you know you don't follow team sports did you follow the case at
*  all though because this got a wider view of things Alex Smith quarterback for the
*  formally the Washington Redskins okay so Alex Smith it was recent quarterback it
*  wasn't I think a season or two ago he got tackled but the way he got tackled
*  was very different he broke his shin bone okay but it wasn't a snap like this
*  right they didn't break it like spaghetti they so this is known as a
*  spiral fracture yeah they twisted it like a sponge and not only that you can
*  see upper there I see the upper left right there that's his leg he had to get
*  I think a dozen of that picture oh well they thought they made a whole
*  documentary on this guy Joe look at this yeah Jamie told me about him and that
*  he's playing again now right you a football fan Jamie Jamie go to that full
*  full picture the upper top one the one there that you got up there on the right
*  hand side no the one you just have just before just before yeah go to make that
*  large Jesus so he had to get look at that that looks like a dog's chew toy okay
*  ready he I thought he wasn't gonna walk again and he got infected
*  and he almost lost his leg a couple of weeks ago he made his return to the NFL
*  that's insane can you believe that look at that look at that calf yeah 17 or so
*  surgeries I think is what he had over the course of how long a year and a half
*  or two look at that picture make that picture bigger that is insane you got to
*  watch the documentary they made on him Joe it is I mean again I love fighters
*  but there's there's more profiles and athletic courage than just what they do
*  they had to take muscle and reattach it down low that's like an American
*  werewolf in London when he starts to change it's like are you are you teen
*  war that's so crazy he made his return oh my god that's um oh my god look how
*  bad that break is yeah again it wasn't in half it was a rotating break that's
*  rough and that crazy well you know there's only been two UFC leg breaks oh
*  my god look at that show the drills you could show if they got the video you
*  could see him do the drills by the way he made 18 million on his year off by
*  the way so yeah nice for him good for him it's just this is video and how did
*  he do when he came back he sucked he wasn't very good but and every time he
*  got tackled you were like oh my god imagine him and his and dude he had his
*  little kids there and his wife and they were like yeah but I was like fuck I
*  could I had a hard time watching he's fine but he's not very good right now is
*  he compromised like to the point will never be the same again to the full
*  extent of that I don't know I mean they put him on the roster and he started at
*  because the the initial quarterback they is young and he's not very good they're
*  gonna get rid of him then the backup got a concussion so he was third string and
*  they're like you're active so I think we have to go back over all the different
*  things you were you were breaking down because I let you go on this long run
*  about sorry I see no no no it was excellent but there was a long run on
*  the UFC and all the different things that you think are disadvantages for
*  fighters yeah MMA in general I don't yeah I don't want to make sure I don't
*  blame just you now for all these problems there's there's the argument
*  there's the monopoly argument right well obviously there's other organizations
*  right there is the professional fighters league they still call it that I believe
*  so which you win the tournament you win a million dollars and that's on NBC
*  sports right ESPN to an ESPN plus now okay it was on NBC this so that's good
*  good for them that's excellent that's where Justin Gaethje came from back
*  when it was the PFL no it wasn't the PFL was it was a World Series of Fighting
*  that's right so you have one FC which pays a lot of money and they brought
*  over Mighty Mouse Johnson and Eddie Alvarez and Brandon Vera's over there I
*  think he's still their heavyweight champion cut down to light heavyweight
*  and lost and literally like drained what's the face I forget the the Malay
*  guy I think that's the song you sing at New Year's the guy's a really good
*  fighter I forget his I don't know how to say his name we should find out his
*  name find out what is the guy who just beat Brandon Vera for the light
*  heavyweight crown Brandon Vera by the way at heavyweight looks fucking
*  phenomenal over there buddy yeah they're letting him take all the
*  Mexican Star Wars yeah you know what good for him good for him yeah I mean
*  he's been around a long time yeah and he's a fucking jackmified over there at
*  at heavyweight he looked really good with soccer kicks and all that shit on
*  the ground like Brandon Vera is a threat I remember him I saw him at Lloyd
*  Irvin's gym 2005 say that name yeah on la I don't know I don't fuck on la he's
*  Burmese so you know he's tough shit he's tough as shit he's really good he's and
*  he is a Henry hoofed student right oh is he really I believe so I believe he
*  trains with the the artists formerly known as the black zillions like what do
*  they call themselves now so now they're Sanford MMA because they got a health
*  care sponsor oh so it was hard knocks 365 and now it's Sanford MMA yeah that's an
*  interesting camp right because you got Gilbert Burns and who's a fucking
*  monster and then you got Kamaru Usman who is now with Trevor Whitman and and
*  he realizes that him and Gilbert Burns are gonna have to go after it right and
*  that's that's gonna be really interesting yeah long-time training
*  partners I can't wait for that one Gilbert Burns is complete you know
*  what's amazing do you remember the quintet that UFC did I think it was like
*  early in the grappling tournament yeah so it's like a five-on-five and it was
*  like it was like Sean O'Malley Anthony Smith who are all good grapplers and
*  then it was like a bunch of I forget I forget who they were going against but
*  every once in a while you'll see like an MMA guy and oh these MMA guys usually
*  pretty good at this point like that not like world-class but like they're very
*  very good and then Gilbert gets down there oh yeah and you're like oh right
*  he's one of them he's one of the elite he's a world champion of course but I
*  mean like he hasn't like I'm sure he's jujitsu has fallen off a little bit
*  relative to what it was when he was just jujitsu but you can tell like some of
*  these guys you know he's not like one of these meow brothers who is you know a
*  gripping heavy kind of leg entanglement strategic kind of guy Gilbert's athletic
*  as shit he can pass he can go underneath he's got a good guard he can wrestle he
*  can do the whole nine yards when I stand next to him I have a hard time
*  believing he ever made 155 it's shocking but he was really compromised he's one
*  of those guys that was really compromised at 155 because he's so thick
*  like he's walking around well over 200 pounds he's thick as fuck right and you
*  know and has zero problem competing with guys like Tyron Woodley at 170 and once
*  he's a fucking monster man his striking is nasty too that's what's interesting
*  about Gilbert is that he is an elite Brazilian jujitsu black belt but his
*  striking is fucking world-class that Woodley fight was an eye-opener oh my
*  god dude his striking is terrifying it's really really good right and I mean
*  here's the thing about it's like you know I mean can you imagine it's like
*  what's your ace in the hole like what's your thing you can go to if you need it
*  oh you're a world champion black belt that's the thing you have if you need it
*  because everything else is good enough to win a UFC title yeah that is fucking
*  frightening yeah if you don't want to stand with him he's terrifying standing
*  by all I mean because he and he could barrel down on Tyron because it's like I
*  mean maybe he'll fight the takedown if it's there but probably not because on
*  the ground you know I mean his ability to sweep or just create space more
*  threaten you or omoplata or whatever yeah good luck fighting that fucking guy
*  on the ground you know probably at welterweight at welterweight let's see
*  about this you have Colby Komoru Masvidal by the way very underrated
*  ground game for Masvidal oh yeah I'm sure you know that I'm just saying for
*  the audience's sake very underrated wrestling everything everything
*  everything but all those guys in the top five Gilbert is your biggest submission
*  threat by a country mile a country mile I would have really loved to have seen
*  Jorge Masvidal and Komaru Usman of Jorge had a camp because he did not have a camp
*  for that fight and still presented some real big problems for Komaru don't you
*  find the ascension of Jorge kind of funny I love it I want to do you remember
*  when he fought Aliah Quintet 155 I do so I was at that fight it was in Fairfax
*  Virginia and I'll never forget fight week was that one of these UFC gyms in
*  somewhere in the suburbs of DC I don't remember where I live in city property
*  like you know go out to the suburbs and it was decently attended it was not a
*  super well attended open workout those you know it was enough people there and
*  Al got a huge you know whatever and I think it was Frankie no it was Chad
*  Mendez and Ricardo Lamas in the main event and Chad was a big alpha male guy
*  at the time and you know he got a big applause
*  Jorge came out and maybe 10 people knew who he was media the the Latin media
*  that was there wanted to talk to him but like most of the media you know it was
*  kind of like give or take on it and I remember thinking to myself like do you
*  know do y'all not know how fucking good this guy's and by the way I thought you
*  won that fight too and then years later out did as well remember yeah and then
*  I was like you're gonna fucking boo me you're gonna fucking boo me
*  gotta love Al's the bowels hilarious but you know to see later it's like it's
*  amazing it's like you're nothing you're nothing you're nothing all of a sudden
*  something well you know the resurrection you know he talks about it how he went
*  on that stupid reality show where they made him live in the jungle for a couple
*  of weeks exultant yeah whatever it was and he was like what the fuck am I doing
*  with my life and then he had a chance to think about all those fights where he
*  just fell short and why did he fall short you know what did he do was he
*  planned it safe and decided he's gonna start baptizing people as he puts it and
*  man you talk about a guy who turned a corner and changed I mean the Ben
*  Askren fight though that was it that was the cherry on top and then of course the
*  the murking of Nate Diaz I mean he beat the fuck out of Nate Diaz I mean that
*  was a crazy fight and they were talking about running that back I was like for
*  what yeah I was confused I was like don't forget Darren Till put his lights
*  up too yes with a beautiful step forward left hook combination I mean he's a
*  monster he's a monster he's hard for anybody to deal with and the fact that
*  he stopped Darren Till when Darren Till was this terrifying striker that just
*  beat down Donald Cerrone you know Darren Till was a scary guy and to see him put
*  him away that way and you know obviously was after Tyron had beaten him but it
*  stunning KO and he's just a fun guy like everything's fun about him
*  like I had him on the podcast and I said the real question is whether or not
*  Ben Askren can get a hold of you he's like he can get a hold of these nuts that's
*  that's him you know I mean that's him he's just a real fun dude he's a fun
*  dude to watch fight he's a fun dude to listen to him talk he's been he can do
*  he sort of cut you off but like Dan Leventard is a big national sports radio
*  guy based out of Miami so a couple of Miami guys a couple of Cuban Americans
*  and they're on opposite sides politically very much so he's all Trump
*  right yes super and Dan Leventard is very left but like I they have this
*  camaraderie through heritage and identity and sort of shared experiences
*  you just can't fake you know yeah he's awesome I'm a big fan but I'm a big fan
*  of him skillfully I think he's a really exceptional fighter he's very clever
*  he also has a very unusual stance like he stands straight up like he stands
*  like a Muay Thai fighter and it's one of the reasons why is his takedown defense
*  is so good he's confident that he could stand straight up like that and his
*  striking is very crisp very clean and he's clever like he sets traps he you
*  know he catches you like that fucking Ben Askren thing was goddamn genius and
*  we see him prep for it when you watch the training footage that he did that
*  over and not only that he prepped for the angle right leaned against the cage
*  so he like presented this and then turned a corner went to the right and
*  then charged at him so that Ben Askren would be like I'm just gonna grab this
*  guy like literally he he set two different traps the running at him and
*  then the turning the corner and then running at him and Ben Askren like
*  instincts just dove in and he couldn't help himself I call it the Jorge Masvidal
*  test go through any of his fights pre till win or lose doesn't matter and watch
*  how many times when you know they're getting the mouthpiece put in and the
*  Vaseline put on at the the beginning watch how many times the commentator
*  says folks don't understand how good he is folks don't know how smart he is this
*  is one of the most well-rounded fighters in all the UFC and they do it in this
*  kind of way to like almost plead with the audience to understand the fighter
*  as they do yeah that would be me yeah Bryan stands done in a million times if
*  you and Bryan standard doing it you're not coordinating it something is
*  happening here well I remember when he knocked out Eve Edwards with a head
*  kick when Eve Edwards is one of the best 155 pounders the world after he
*  did Eve Edwards had beaten Josh Thompson who's another guy who doesn't get nearly
*  the respect that he deserves the first guy to ever knock out Nate Diaz right
*  I mean Josh Thompson at one point in time was the fucking man right and so he
*  knocks out Eve Edwards in Bodog remember Bodog I have all the DVDs at home
*  Bodog for people don't remember Calvin Ayers who's like this big gambling guy
*  who there I think what they were trying to do here it is was boom god damn that
*  was beautiful and total finishing look at this
*  poses like he's a male model yeah but they put down a bunch of fights like good
*  fights that was where Cain Velasquez made his debut that was where Matt
*  Lindlin fought Phaidor remember that like but I think their idea was online
*  gambling they're gonna do it and they were gonna be compensated through online
*  gambling but then that was right when online gambling got shut down in the
*  United States which is really weird because like why are you shutting online
*  gambling down we can be in person and gambling like what why you decided where
*  people can gamble what is this and the company went under and I think Calvin
*  Ayers like I think he's like a fugitive I think he has to like live in other
*  countries I don't know I'm not you might be right because Dana and him were
*  going back and forth and yeah because Calvin Ayers when he had the Bodog thing
*  had a big billboard for Bodog fight but it was him like Calvin Ayers like in
*  Vegas like looking slick with a nice tailored expensive suit and he was
*  talking shit about Dana White and Dana White's like you can't even get in this
*  country like you're a fucking fugitive for the love they come in this country
*  they'll arrest you like I don't remember what it was but I think it was
*  one of those things where he was doing this online gambling thing and they were
*  like this is illegal and he's like fuck you I'll do it and Belize or some shit
*  Costa Rica I think something like that I think he lives there now he has to I
*  don't think he's a little I don't think he can step foot in America I might be
*  talking that term please don't sue me yeah see if you could find that because
*  but he's a big he's a big gambling guy I mean he's a big online gambling guy and
*  think there was some weird shit that went down which look I'm a big fan of
*  personal freedom and I'm a big fan of people to be able to being able to
*  gamble wherever the fuck they want and I'm not a big fan of people regulating
*  things like unless you can prove that someone's getting robbed unless you can
*  prove they're stealing money from people I think they should be able to gamble
*  sure I think that was a that was one of the things that happened with that Bodog
*  organization but they threw around a lot of money put together what is it
*  he got also involved in a cryptocurrency afterwards hmm that sounds about right
*  yeah that case who initially I think has been settled though the cryptocurrency
*  can I know the initial the Bodog oh so he's allowed to come to America I don't
*  know about that sorry Calvin again don't sue me well but he put to God got it say
*  he put together some great fucking fights
*  Jail Sonnen fought there Jake Allenberger fought there tons of good guys fought at the Bodog
*  yeah and they did on the beach with hot chicks who was her name you know who
*  fought there was the brother and sister combo Karina and Rodrigo Dam they did
*  the capoeira shit you know they would be in the middle and they would do this
*  shit during the middle of a fight yeah they would fuck people up too well you know the
*  interesting thing is like I don't know what what happened with that organization
*  but they put together a small number of fights I think it was maybe three or four
*  fights three or four cards but if you go back and look at those three or four
*  cards like they fucking hold up they hold up like any affliction event you know
*  which is another organization that threw a lot of money into big fights you ever
*  heard you ever talked to Jeff Osborne sure Jeff Osborne and I did commentary
*  in the very first UFC I'm a big fan of his nobody like recently no I haven't
*  so out of nowhere I'm no longer with SiriusXM they I moved on but I had a
*  show once and they were like Jeff Osborne's online one I'm like wait the
*  Jeff Osborne so Jeff has a memorabilia shop of like all MMA shit in his
*  hometown and he called in and we talked about a bunch of shoot who can shoot
*  right it's him but also with do you realize this the Kane fight that they
*  had was in a ice rink in the middle of an ice rink and actually built a studio
*  slash like stage presence for it in the middle of an ice rink and like wherever
*  the fuck it was st. Petersburg and then a ring to make it look like they were
*  like somewhere else meanwhile they're in the middle of a fucking ice rink really
*  yeah all dude his story fight was this Kane's fight there I thought Kane fought
*  on the beach no no who did Kane fight I couldn't tell you who the fuck knows but
*  I could barely I mean this was Bo dog Bo dog was this the same card where
*  Linlin fought Fador I don't think so but again I can't be sure but you got to
*  reconnect with him sometime because this motherfucker love to I love to have
*  Bo dog stories are like out of control see this this is this is in the middle
*  of an ice rink Jeremiah constant yeah he's buddy you got you got fat tattooed
*  guy versus Kane came about to work you like no Kane was a force of nature he's
*  the best heavyweight I've ever seen I'm not saying he's the best heavyweight
*  ever but in terms of the eye test and what he could do nobody was better than
*  you know the thing is it's like how long can you be at that level that's the real
*  question it's it's not sometimes you want to look at a guy like you look at
*  Anderson right and you look at the Jared Kenan near fight or you look at the
*  second Chris Wyman fights really interesting you look at Anderson's
*  career and actually went over it last night so I knew I was gonna talk to you
*  today and also I was thinking you know there's one point in time where I was
*  convinced that Anderson was a goat and I think he was at his time I think in his
*  in his in his prime he was the goat at the time and you go from the Chris
*  Wideman fight where he's the baddest motherfucker on earth Chris Wideman
*  chaos him and then he loses every fight afterwards except Derek Brunson except
*  Derek Brunson he beats Derek Brunson by decision but he loses every other fight
*  it's crazy I mean you look at him you go from Chris
*  Levin starch and Chris Levin you look at his fights I mean there was a few that
*  people forget there's a few that were boring right there was a there was you
*  know the tell us like to use else latest fight wasn't that good either
*  Patrick O'Tay was very cautious because Patrick O'Tay knew that Anderson so was
*  a counter fighter and Patrick had a powerful fucking right hand and Patrick's
*  like I'll let you come to me bitch and then Patrick with a weird thing like he
*  hopped on his knee to throw a kick and his knee just blew out and he fell and
*  held his knee and that was a really but the Damien Maya fight people forget
*  that that was an Abu Dhabi and he came fucking like hell on wheels in the first
*  couple of rounds trying to take Damien Maya out and Damien Maya survived and
*  then he just coasted for the last few rounds and everybody was terribly upset
*  it was really Anderson Silva like I remember Dana White was like if he does
*  that again I'll cut him and everybody's like whoa this is crazy like everyone
*  was so furious because this was the big fight in Abu Dhabi BJ Penn fought Frankie
*  Edgar and Frankie Edgar upset him and everyone's like this is crazy BJ Penn
*  lost and then Anderson Silva comes out like a demon and he was like screaming
*  at Damien Maya and Damien Maya is probably the nicest most respectful
*  person I don't know what their beef was about I just still to this day don't
*  understand what it was but for whatever it was Anderson had in his head he was
*  angry at Damien Maya and fought very emotionally and tried to take him out
*  and didn't I also thinking that fourth maybe was a fifth round Damien hurt him
*  yeah there's a big punch that lands and you watch the body language and the sort
*  of tactical approach begin to change almost instantly after he gets drilled
*  with one now maybe I'm not saying he's the best record I'm just saying at that
*  moment it was hot out too by the way you were there right yeah we were outside it was
*  fucking hot and I think and they're also bugs flying around like the size of
*  birds it was weird like what is that thing like it was like weird because we're
*  outside and Damien survived he survived the initial onslaught and then you know
*  but just could never be fast enough to take Anderson you know to get a hold of
*  him down he was meaningfully moving the right he just wasn't at that level like
*  striking was just he but he did threaten him he did hit him and then Anderson
*  decided to coast but Damien and Dana was so mad and folks understand too this was
*  I think two things were happening at the time one that was when they had made the
*  sale to flash entertainment and they had sold 10% of the company I believe that's
*  why they had gone to Abu Dhabi was partly of those reasons that was sort of
*  an internal thing that was an external thing but folks don't realize this this
*  was in the UFC was fucking red hot red hot I mean they could not miss every
*  time they come out maybe the pay-per-view wasn't great but it wouldn't
*  sell poorly you know this was at the time where I don't think it was too far
*  removed from I remember when I was in New Orleans once with now my wife my
*  then-girlfriend and we watched I remember this card got super fucked up
*  I don't even remember what the initial one was supposed to be it ended up as
*  Rashad versus Tiago Silva remember that it was three rounds and it sucked yeah
*  that thing still did almost 400,000 buys I mean they could not miss and they had
*  Anderson Silva they had all these sort of important guests there this was this
*  coronation moment for this like new opportunity and it kind of shit the bed
*  a little bit and Dana was fucking heated whoo after that I can understand that too
*  I can understand it too yeah it was a it was not a good fight but Anderson when
*  he was in his prime there was moments like the Forrest Griffin fight where you
*  walked away and just go who's better than that fucking guy you know but
*  obviously it was a tailor-made kind of style for Anderson Forrest was like a
*  blood and guts come forward you know doesn't hide anything just really
*  charges and Anderson would just like see everything he was so relaxed he would
*  find openings and the the the famous step back away from those punches and
*  they just hit him with the right hand a fade away right hand and knock him out
*  it's what Hall hit him with did you see that fight over the weekend which fight
*  Hall-Sola, oh your Ryan Hall yes exactly yeah it was like it was a slightly
*  different but I saw it and I was like dude this is a game where you stay around
*  long enough and the elderly get eaten well it was also like when you're
*  watching Anderson move he's doing things that he would have never done when he
*  was younger it's almost like he's trying to like get the sparks flying like crank
*  the engine over but it doesn't want to you know he's moving forward in a way
*  that like you like ah like you would never see the Anderson Silva that fucked
*  up Rich Franklin twice you would never see him fight like that the Anderson
*  Silva that stopped Chris Liebman he would never fight like that you know
*  that Anderson was a clever tactician that Anderson was a was a
*  technical fighter whereas like he fought really aggressive in the first round but
*  if you know go back to Vitor being on TRT you give Anderson TRT you'll see a
*  different fighter but if you want to make him fight on the natch you're you're
*  45 man this is 45 it's 45 it's like unless you're Bernard Hopkins unless
*  you're a guy that's so fucking good at boxing where you're clever and you don't
*  waste any energy and you're so disciplined and so technical and so
*  defensive oriented that you can take these like world championship caliber
*  young guys and drag them into seven eight nine rounds and then set traps for
*  them and eventually capitalize on them there's very few guys that get to the
*  point like Bernard got into his 50s it's it's when he changed his nickname to the
*  alien yeah I didn't think it was a better nickname but it was maybe a more
*  appropriate one you know then when he fought Joe Smith and he got knocked out
*  through the ropes and fell and landed on his head right I was like oh Jesus
*  Christ this is the difference is you highlight I think is really important
*  between Hopkins and and and Silva which is that it would not be accurate to say
*  that Silva lived on his chin that is not true but it would be accurate to say
*  there was a couple of times he let it slide you'd see times and fights where
*  he would kind of just take one and then like his head would whip but he'd still
*  be right there about the whole hey Rivera fight right remember the cage
*  rage fight he let him punch him in the face right this is I mean I was a little
*  more it was a little more demonstrative but I was crazy okay but there's there
*  was all these moments where he would kind of let it go mm-hmm and he just at
*  45 you just do not have the capacity for that yeah at all you don't yeah and also
*  again we're talking about a natural 45 a guy who can't you know you're you know
*  you have a very low testosterone level my back hurts I'm 41 my back hurts when
*  I got a fucking bet I know you know I'm not a class athlete but I'm just saying
*  like training camp but even if you watch him train it's it's not what you want to
*  see you know I've watched training footage of Anderson it's all it's hard
*  to say unless you're in the gym with him day in day out like what what kind of
*  output he's really doing but when I'm watching him hit the mitts and hit the
*  pads and it's just not it's not what I used to see he is he is one of I think
*  three there may be more but if I had to ask how many fighters currently
*  competing in the ultimate fighting championship have pro MMA wins that
*  predate 9-eleven Robbie Lawler him and over him are the ones that come to mind
*  that's about it there might be a couple Diego but Diego's out of the mix now
*  right I'm sure he has a win that predates 9-eleven he might but the point
*  is that not in the UFC you're right because his debut was 205 oh no you see
*  it made me just period thousand five does he have one that predates 9-eleven
*  really Diego I don't know he's 2005 he was his debut in the UFC when he won
*  ultimate fighter season one okay right that's 2005 correct mm-hmm there's a
*  certain there's a certain beauty to it which is I know you appreciate this you
*  know I was thinking about it like you there's a lot of strikers and like a
*  lot of great fighters folks don't remember and so about him fought him
*  but like you know Mark we're folks have looked or Mark was a great fight dude
*  Silvas maybe best fight and this is debatable because of the Chael Sonnen
*  comeback but you asked me like my favorite Anderson Silva fight he fought
*  lightning Lee Murray Lee Murray in trade in cage rage in London when by the way
*  everyone knows Lee Murray as like oh the guy who robbed the bank because it's
*  such an incredible story and I recognize that but put that aside for just a
*  minute lightning Lee Murray was a bad motherfucker bad he could fight his ass
*  off he was very good vicious power and athletic and quick and like hard yes
*  super fucking just elegantly evil okay and Anderson Silva beat the fucking
*  breaks off of him in London in front of Lee Murray's hometown crowd and did it
*  and did it with a certain gusto and no one knows that shit yeah because can
*  you imagine if you just joined I listen you come to MMA when you come to MMA you
*  can't you can't be one of his fans like beats up on newer fans because they
*  didn't I got lucky someone introduced me yeah but can you imagine
*  understanding Anderson Silva as a function of like Conor McGregor popularity
*  like you came to UFC because of him and that's all you know oh my fucking god
*  you missed the whole show yeah you missed the evolution because there was
*  times where like if you go back do you remember Alex Stiebling the Brazilian
*  killer they didn't like that nickname too much Anderson caught him with a high
*  kick and busted open his eyebrow and stopped him but I believe and someone
*  correct me from wrong Jamie look at pulled up Anderson Silva's record I
*  think Rio Chonan beat him after Lee Murray yes he did the Leo Rio Chonan man
*  that was a crazy fight so did what's this face flying scissors hold yeah that was
*  his last fight in pride he went from that I think to maybe had the Otsuka
*  fight I have to go look it up but he went from that to the Liebman fight I
*  believe so something something like that I think he might have fought one more
*  time in cage rage Lee Murray and then Rio Chonan that's right Curtis Stout another good
*  remember cage rage 40 so that's what's interesting right so he loses to Rio
*  Chonan and then beats the fuck out of Jorge Rivera but that was after the Lee
*  Murray fight right so he went from Lee Murray which was arguably I agree with
*  you one of his most impressive decisions one of most impressive victories rather
*  and then Rio Chonan beats him people forgot about Rio Chonan and then the
*  you should know commie win is disqualification he just up kicked him on
*  his knees that was BJ's promotion and then the Tony Fricklin crazy upward
*  elbow and then he went and fought Chris Liebman after that remember when Liebman
*  said he was gonna send him back to Japan yeah hi I'll never forget I was that so I
*  had a job in Washington DC in this job I hate I used to work in a little bit in
*  politics and I hate I hated this fucking job and I'll never forget it was the
*  night of Silva versus Liebman and I everyone was like hey we got a bunch of
*  work to do blah blah blah blah and I was like I had to make up some excuse
*  I'm like I think I have AIDS I'm sick I don't know something's wrong and I was like I had to go home and I sprinted home and then I was like I don't want to watch this alone and I went to a bar that was near where I was living at the time and I watched it and it was one of the most I've never like drinking alone stories usually don't end with it like a smile and glee but I know when I none of my friends like MMA I'm just the only one and so I didn't have anybody to call so I just like fuck I was gonna go to the bar and I watched it and it was one of the truly like great sports memories of my life you know yeah I remember
*  I had friends come into that and that was back when you could bet I mean you still
*  can bet but you I used to bet on fights I used to bet on fights before I didn't
*  nobody told me not to but I decided at a certain point I probably should stop and
*  I don't think I'd bet on that I think that was like the last one I didn't bet
*  on because like this is stealing money because whatever the line was it wasn't
*  big enough I was like listen to me and I was talking to my friends I go that
*  motherfucker can't lose I go this guy's an assassin. Can I make a request to
*  Jimmy to look at it? Can you go to bestfightodds.com? I'm not paid it's just a repository for
*  good information sure you can look up someone's odds throughout their career
*  okay how it opened how it closed let's go bestodds.com that's what it is
*  bestfightodds.com and try to find the Chris Levin Anderson Silverfly
*  just punch in someone's name like Wikipedia and it'll show you all their
*  odds but I remember telling my friend this is stealing money I'm like this
*  motherfucker's an assassin I'm like he's so good he's so good I thought it might
*  be competitive in the sense that silver was better here we go so do they have it
*  ah fuck I don't think they have it it goes all the way back to Nate Marquardt
*  how's that was 2007 that close Jesus yeah that's crazy well Nate was really
*  fucking good that's why I mean Anderson was only a two-to-one favorite back then
*  but you got to remember that's Nate Marquardt when he was in his prime and
*  Nate Marquardt king of pancraze bro when I talked to Brendan Schaub and Brendan
*  Schaub was training with Nate Marquardt he goes dude let me tell you something
*  goes I never saw that motherfucker lose a round in sparring Nate Marquardt is a
*  guy who at one point in time was one of the elite of the elite remember he
*  knocked out Damien Maia with one punch I mean the air yeah he was a fucking
*  killer man but he knocked out Tyron Woodley with like one of the most nasty
*  fucking video game combinations you've ever seen it was like right out of
*  Mortal Kombat he hit what's-his-face who's the striking goes Christian Allen
*  is that his name the striking coach over there for him he's the striking coach at
*  elevation now I think he's like Corey Sandhagen's guy is that I think it's
*  Christian Allen who I've never talked to him but everyone tells me he's a fucking
*  genius he hit Wilson Gouveia remember this he hit him with the he hit him with
*  the punch punch high kick spin back fist oh yeah he hit him with that
*  guy too Wilson Gouveia another good guy there's so many fighters that just like
*  you like you forget about Travis Luthor like oh yeah yeah but he's training the
*  next gen of guys is he Kevin Hollins out of Travis Luthor's gym is he really
*  Kevin Hollins fucking good yeah he's fucking good Travis Luthor is one of
*  those guys where I remember you know I remember when he fought Silva was like
*  this one might be worth watching and then he missed the way let me tell you this dude I've never seen
*  anybody closer to death than I did Travis Luthor on his way to making the weight when he missed the
*  weight and then he was going to the scale and I saw him shuffling because he couldn't walk could
*  pick his legs up he was shuffling like he was snow skiing right and then his lips were cracked
*  like you could see like they're red in between the cracks like his like he had no water in his body
*  and he was trying to make weight and he couldn't make weight that's how Habib was I interviewed him
*  we had media day before the Ferguson fight at 209 which obviously did not happen we did media
*  day and it was my turn to talk to Habib and I stuck a microphone in his face and he had the
*  worst cut I've seen I've seen you know in 15 years in the fight business and I've covered you know
*  collegiate and Olympic wrestling a little bit I've seen cottonmouth okay I've seen a lot of it that
*  is the worst cottonmouth I have ever seen in my life I mean he could barely separate the tongue
*  from the inside of his mouth it's crazy to make guys talk like that you know it's also crazy that
*  we allow that you know I applaud one FC for their weight cutting measures I think what they've
*  done with their their whole hydration thing I think it's the most important thing in MMA I
*  think we need to do that across the board but I think there needs to be more options for fighters
*  I think there should be more weight classes I really really really do I'd be a little bit
*  skeptical of them yeah here's what I'm saying the weight hydration system as we understand it through
*  collegiate wrestling appears to be a godsend right so what we understand of it works now I am going
*  to be very clear about what I'm about to tell you I am not declaring to you that what they are
*  telling us about their weight cutting system is wrong because like you I've talked to Ben Ascrin
*  I've talked to Gary Tonin and they really enjoyed it what I'm telling you is I'm a little bit
*  skeptical of the veracity of the claims that aren't independently verified they have only
*  recently begun to stream their weigh-ins and even then you can't see what's on the scale you have
*  no idea about if someone is missing weight and there could be any number of factors related to
*  whether or not they actually made it I'm just telling you I personally as a guy in media I do
*  not take promoters word for it and so this is not me declaring to you that their weigh-ins are
*  fugazi this is me declaring to you until we get independent verification of them I would pause a
*  little bit on some of their claims do you know what fugazi really means do you know where it
*  comes from I know the band and I know it's supposed to mean likes because I'm from DC fugazi is actually
*  how I pronounce the band I say fugazi but it means sort of counterfeit it was a company that was
*  writing bad checks I'm pretty sure it was a limo company and they were writing sounds that sounds
*  perfect they're writing bad checks and so became like synonymous a fugazi check I found my friend
*  Mike Starr was a who's in the godfather goodfellas been a bunch of movies he was in Dumb and Dumber he
*  told me about I was like what the fuck is fugazi yeah I'm from DC so we know waiting room there's
*  a there's a bit of I have a bit of skepticism about their drug policy good because a bit yeah
*  quite a bit quite a bit and now now the V tour is over there and they got a few guys over there
*  they look pretty juicy yeah good I don't care it doesn't bother me I don't care if it's known you
*  know the thing is it's it's like I wish there was a policy like there's an argument that could be
*  made when it comes to things like Tour de France that you could argue that it's safer to do it with
*  the steroids than it is without right with the blood it kills the human body yeah it's destructive
*  and like there's an argument that like doing that with it is actually healthier the problem is in
*  this country we have this idea that you're cheating and it's un-American we have it from
*  baseball and Mark McGuire all the other yeah there's a lot of weirdness when it comes to that so the
*  last few years I remember I used to talk to Travis Tiger who runs you saw to pretty regularly back
*  in 2015 or so and I found him to be very earnest guy very nice I think he's very committed to his
*  mission this is not I have nothing bad to say about him personally other with other than now
*  I couldn't find more disagreement with him if my life depended on it basically sent me down a
*  rabbit hole and let me tell you what I've been doing the last five years of my life no one will
*  tell you this I don't know why but there is this entire movement and I don't mean of weirdos and
*  people of ill repute and people who haven't done their homework I'm talking academic scholars with
*  research who have done the homework in the most complex of ways right there is this entire body
*  of work around anti-doping and if you follow the rabbit hole that I went down this is not some
*  YouTube rabbit hole you in fact if you look you can't you can't find it this is it's it's dense
*  reading quite candidly the history of anti-doping where it come from where it comes from how it
*  developed and what the status is today you can only come away with a couple of conclusions one
*  anti-doping globally is a dramatic failure it has not worked and number two the major problem that
*  I have is I'm not expecting everyone to agree with what I say about anti-doping many of my views are
*  outside of the Overton window but the debate around anti-doping is so incomplete and so
*  dishonest that it's hard to get in a word edgewise it's hard to get people to understand that like
*  you're just repeating 1980s drug war nonsense without even really realizing that's what you're
*  doing if you actually examine the facts of the case again maybe you'll come to the conclusion
*  that I come to maybe you won't what is the conclusion you've come to that here is basically what we
*  should do with drugs and sport they are not going away there's nothing we can do about it they are
*  not going away and to the extent they go away genetic manipulation will happen with the crisper
*  technology or some other version of it or there's something called financial doping which big clubs
*  get involved in in Europe it's been a big problem over there as well what does that mean financial
*  doping is a basically way to cook it's a they call it doping because it's a way to make things
*  sound bad in fact the word doping comes from the early 20th century when they were trying to figure
*  out a name for giving horses drugs they called it doping and then they used that they ported it
*  over to human athletics to sort of make it sound and by the way in fairness it was the mafia doing
*  a lot of that so they took this sort of like organized crime human on animal crime and then
*  they brought it over to a human sport but basically this idea of like oh we have certain limits you
*  can't pay more in salary than this we'll find ways to sort of manipulate the books to make sure
*  that you get paid more and I get paid more it won't show up on the ledger in the way that it
*  normally would when you actually calculate the total we're not meeting the demands of keeping the
*  payload restricted so that we can remain competitive across the league it's called financial doping but
*  there's a couple of scholars Werner Muller out of I think he's out of Denmark and then Paul D'Amelio
*  out of Scotland they have written a couple of books on the history of anti-doping on the state
*  of anti-doping on the ethics of doping and anti-doping these are not guys who think that
*  steroids should just be legal people think that like this is one of the major problems with being
*  the position that I'm in people like oh you just think everyone should take steroids no that's not
*  what I think I think if you're an athlete and you say listen man I'm really good and I don't want
*  to take drugs to compete I think that's perfectly reasonable I don't think there's anything wrong
*  with that but when you begin to drill down how you solve that problem no one really wants to get to
*  what the heart of the issue is first the issue is this everyone you cannot understand drugs in
*  America without understanding media hysteria and how it has changed things and no one should
*  appreciate this more than you think of any drug we've ever had to what extent have false media
*  narratives exaggerated claims totally ridiculous things have had to been year over year pulled
*  back by virtue of evidence that has weighed in or you know whatever the case reefer madness is
*  sort of like the common example steroids is exactly that way the claims of harms related to them are
*  totally overstated it does not mean there are no harms it means relative to what people have
*  claimed it is simply not true in fact the Australian government did a study over like what would be the
*  most sort of harmful drugs in a human experience and it was behind tobacco it was behind numerous
*  other drugs well in advance that are perfectly legal and have a deeper societal exception or
*  acceptance excuse me so that's for harm though right it's for harm yes terms of actual performance
*  I'll get to that the argument about steroids especially as relates to combative sports if
*  you wanted to make the claim that if you and I were fighting and we're let's say reasonably
*  and I took it and you didn't it tilts the competitive balance and that makes it unfair I would agree I
*  think that is actually true I don't think there's much argument about that but that is not really
*  fully what they claim what they claim as it relates to MMA is that or any other combative sport is
*  that it makes MMA safer there is literally not a shred of evidence they have ever presented not one
*  time that makes that true Joe you've been watching MMA a long time looks safer to you
*  I wouldn't imagine it makes it safer I wouldn't imagine that was a key selling ingredient when
*  you saw that was sold to the public about why it was necessary I think the argument is that if
*  someone is on it and the other person is an a la Vitor versus Michael Bisping that Michael Bisping
*  winds up blind in one eye from a high kick by Vitor right so let's let's remove that example
*  for one second because it's such a it's such a powerful example it's like the it's like the Ben
*  Johnson of examples show me all the way Carl Lewis was on some shit of course yeah of course
*  he was he was on some shit show me the evidence that since the introduction of you allegedly don't
*  sue me Carl yeah don't Carl be friendly Carl get together with Calvin show me the evidence show me
*  the evidence that MMA has become safer as a virtue because what everyone had said at the time was
*  this is not like hitting a baseball this is not like dunking a basketball we need to protect the
*  health and safety of athletes right the the Vitor Belfort incident doesn't even come close to the
*  cyborg versus MVP incident where he cracked his skull which was ostensibly totally done naturally
*  yes okay the idea that was crazy it was super fucking crazy the fighting is like smoking you
*  can smoke Marlboro Reds you can smoke menthols you can smoke lights at the end of the day you're
*  putting yourself at risk at a pretty significant degree it does not matter what kind of filter you
*  put on the cigarette and you can make the argument that if you are taking EPO and if you are taking
*  testosterone you'd have more energy to get away from shots as much as you would have energy to
*  land them I think the argument about could be safer here's the issue I think the argument what
*  taking what is complex and I think ultimately the athletes should decide right so who should
*  decide who takes what in the UFC I think the athletes should work with the UFC to make a
*  broader decision and by the way they might decide that you saw it is what they want I cannot preclude
*  that as a possibility but to me it's like let's take the Pepsi challenge let's bring in Vata and
*  let's see how many to a man decide this is something that they want I bet you you get the
*  numbers drop off fairly significantly do you think there's a way to skirt the system right now even
*  with you saw it I think there's some some therapeutics some shit that people aren't do you think so of
*  course I would imagine but I'm not let me make it to it so I'm just guessing let's let's say
*  something outright okay this will get me in trouble with the with the Puritans but I think
*  it deserves to be so I'm real please when I watch athletes who I think or know are on something the
*  sport tends to be better okay when I watch Mark McGuire hit balls into fucking Mars I love it I
*  think it's great well especially baseball because that's the only good thing about that stupid
*  fucking sport it's not my favorite sport in the world meatheads it's a ball into another dimension
*  right but when I watch when I watch any other sport where I know it's drug-addled it does not
*  reduce my enjoyment of it and that's you're supposed to have this moralistic puritanical idea
*  because I understand this is complex but the basic idea is this all the claims that folks want to
*  make about MMA as it relates to safety there is no indication that if you say you saw it as working
*  it's any safer you're asking about how it's being used now it's a little hard to say because again
*  you saw it claims a lot of victories without providing any evidence about them right I mean
*  I've never I've never in my life can you imagine you're somebody you hired to do some kind of
*  service for you claiming all the victories they claim and then when you ask to see the receipts
*  they don't have any I mean it's really what I know they I know Jeff Novicki came on your show and
*  I'm sure he means well but saying that the testosterone has been lowered I actually asked
*  Paul D'Amio about it it means nothing it doesn't in any way there's no way to draw any conclusion
*  about usage there's a guy by the way he has a YouTube channel more plates more dates he's
*  been a longtime steroid user and PD user he has gone through several UFC fighters he has shown it
*  was a recent study that was done you can still take all kinds of testosterone exogenously and
*  come way under the limit for what you saw that is looking for more to the point what we know from
*  academic research is that but they do tart carbon isotope test you can see it's easy to be all of
*  this stuff really yeah here is the key what we know from academic research is that is there a
*  reason to believe that relative to what commissions were doing that the introduction of USADA has
*  overall depressed usage there is some reason to believe that and this physique changes yes but
*  again here goes again everyone doesn't respond to physique changes normally or equally in other
*  words you could have genetics that make real major pronouncements and change related to physique
*  change and I could take the exact same thing you're taking and not have the same result but the
*  point the point is is this is that as it relates to these considerations what ends up happening is
*  you might depress overall usage but what you do is you end up empowering the folks at the higher
*  end I mean since 1960 the growth in pharmaceuticals which the antidoping world basically just plays
*  catch-up on all the time I mean they didn't catch Marion Jones right the way they got her was
*  somebody mailed some shit anonymously then they developed a test for it and all of a sudden Eureka
*  but the amount of independent stuff they can find to catch everyone they have to wait until
*  someone basically tells them about it you what you end up doing is you end up codifying a system
*  where the rich are able to avoid detection and entrench their relative advantages over those who
*  don't have those economic resources so you might have prevented overall amounts of use that's one
*  plausible explanation but by doing that you have only made those who had more money to begin with
*  solidify their position but what is the alternative the alternative is you let people get juicy as
*  they want no do you have limitations so here's my view on things okay number one look at American
*  football and this is what kills me and MMA fans try to defend USADA it's like this this ain't the
*  hill to die on folks in American football we have multiple deaths and fatalities every year I'm
*  sorry deaths or paralysis every year not just that we have multiple deaths at the high school
*  level annually annually these kids die if you look at the health outcomes from American football
*  relative to a fighting it is much worse across the board in American football and that is a sport
*  where you can get caught taking something and they'll suspend you for four fucking games you
*  are watching in the NFL and I don't want to name names because I don't want to be sued but you see
*  a lot of guys in their 40s or late 30s continuing to do shit that they're not supposed to be able
*  to do or they look like fucking he-man it's because it is very easy to take something in the NFL and
*  avoid detection and the fans simply do not care the idea that they're really concerned about the
*  health and safety given the outcomes and given the nature of the sport is simply does does not
*  match the reality at all so what do I think is best a couple of things one if you have a system
*  where the athletes have a say and they work with the organization and they carve out a system where
*  it may not be as rigorous as possible because by the way there's a study at the University of
*  Adelaide testing is basically low information it's basically theater for low information fans it's
*  not it does something but not really all that much the real big fucking fish that you saw to get or
*  any other anti-doping agency is a function of investigations through snitching which MMA fans
*  don't like I'm like folks that's how the sausage is made I don't know what to tell you so if you
*  are to do testing you'd have to do it literally the University of Adelaide has a study that came
*  out said it had to be basically every day but that would require privacy invasions right so you have
*  this enormous amount of privacy invasions where they have no life they would constantly be under
*  rigorous control different though with testing every day versus testing randomly like how would
*  you catch someone like what are they obviously there's if they're taking something and you just
*  wake them up at six o'clock in the morning hey Frankie Edgar I gotta check your piss like you're
*  gonna catch them if they're taking something on a daily basis right yeah well you mean through
*  random or through random random is the idea is that it would happen frequently enough that there
*  would be no method of artist very few methods of avoiding detection the idea though is that there
*  are sufficient things you can take to gain real clear advantages that even randomized testing
*  simply could not account for again it would be some kind of proprietary drug that a rich person
*  could make that there'd be no test for as a clear example so but if you did okay so something that
*  doesn't have a test for it currently right something like the clear something like what
*  Balko came up again something like that but there's a couple of them so here's what I'm saying to you
*  one is like what's a what's a suitable model well NBA MLB to a lesser extent but MLB and then NFL
*  we already exist in a world where basically a pretty significant chunk of those guys are taking
*  something and nobody seems to care and it works out well for everyone what they people claim they
*  don't like is the sort of the scandalization of it all what is the Billy Corbin documentary on
*  Alex Rodriguez oh I've seen it screwball it's fucking amazing it's fucking great is it little
*  kids little kids are acting the part of Billy Corbin or excuse me Alex Rodriguez and the other
*  players and all these like low-level mafioso types you know but what a genius idea to do it
*  that way yeah well let me just get this out sorry I'm sorry I know I'm ranting but the last thing
*  is this is there's a couple different methods you can pick you can just decide that the existing
*  professional sports leagues in my judgment have totally figured it out which is that you get a
*  union to organize basic protections you put kind of a lid on the lobster and you just let it cook
*  there without sort of really being super inside the details about it which means you will allow
*  for some but you basically get to a point where there's not too many violations you're not giving
*  too much of an advantage and you just let it rock because the general for-profit sports world tends
*  to prefer that yeah but then we're just we're agreeing to deception we're agreeing on deception
*  we already agreed to deception right but why do that if you thought it's not you thought it's not
*  the cure to the listen I'm not a I'm not a fan of some of the practices the big one is things like
*  Josh Barnett gets hit for a tainted supplement he disputes it he's out for I believe it was more
*  than nine months yeah they say oh we fucked up it's a mistake you're free to fight but what what
*  happens to all that time and money that he's missing nothing no one compensates him it gets
*  worse than they don't exonerate him how about Tom lawyer Tom Lawler I mean they took his career
*  from him it needs to be said out loud you saw to tested Tom Lawler and they said you tested positive
*  for it was an Austrian at the time and you tested at such a level we're gonna ban you for two years
*  two years later they come up with a test that makes them give it more refined results and they
*  come back and they say if you had tested at this level you'd have been totally exonerated they took
*  that fucking guy's career from him and they never apologized and they never acknowledged that
*  basically they had too much belief in their scientific instrumentation to ever say sorry
*  dude that is fucking evil that's evil that is evil you cannot do that to a person so this is my
*  point here's what I think the health there's one system is which is let the sport basically
*  let a union decide and work the with the union decides with the sports organization the other
*  one is basically what the but the the strength of fitness world has done which is that you have some
*  competitions where you just don't test and you have some where you do and that's not a perfect
*  solution either right because you can still take it and try to take the one that's sort of again
*  we're agreeing to deception this is why I'm what is the most of the way there there there is no
*  alternative well isn't the alternative let them do whatever they want sort of not test sort of I
*  mean at that point see because I just don't I don't imagine a world where we're gonna agree that
*  that doesn't make any sense to me because that's the world we live in I understand but but to to
*  legislate it to mandate this you're saying like it's some kind of harm to it it's if you have an
*  organization like the UFC that's this multi-billion dollar organization they're never going to come up
*  with rules or say hey guys we know you're gonna lie so we're gonna allow you to lie and we're
*  gonna talk to your unions and we're gonna set it up so you can lie they're not gonna do that no no
*  but what they will agree to is certain amounts of protections for the rights of athletes and
*  through those protections they can lie they could lie yes seems so ridiculous that's the world we
*  live in man is it every every lawyer in the world has used that trick let's let's assume let's let's
*  go from where we are now to the future where I agree with you we will have things like CRISPR and
*  genetic manipulation and some other methods that we probably haven't even invented yet right and
*  they're gonna invent them and they're gonna have perfect physical specimens what do we do then then
*  it's gonna be ridiculous to say that you can't do certain things because it's gonna be undetectable
*  it's gonna be unstoppable you're gonna have people in China that are they're making designer babies
*  that are seven feet tall and they're they're built like he man we're gonna get to that point
*  eventually right so here's the deal you have to have stratified sports is the answer and people
*  don't want that balkanized world stratified how so in the sense that basically what happens now is
*  that like let's say you want to compete in elite weightlifting right that's what you want to do you
*  don't really have much of a choice to do it other than through the Olympics but if you want to do it
*  through the Olympics then it involves a series of procedures that relate to antidoping and blah
*  blah blah okay but what if you want to do like strongman for example people kind of clown it
*  because they do it in a circusy way but to me it's a perfectly legitimate sport by any other sports
*  measurements and you can't compete at world's strongest man's unless you are juiced to the
*  motherfucking guild or girls it's phenomenal to watch but what strongman has figured out is the
*  average person men or women by the way they may want to train strongman they want to compete in
*  their local tournament they want to compete nationally they have a series of all different
*  kinds of competitions for those who do want to do drugs and for those who don't for weight classes
*  for age for gender and everything else in between now you don't get the satisfaction of saying that
*  you won Tour de France the only competition as relates to that there's no I mean there's other
*  ones to you know the races but there's only one Tour de France but you have to live in a world
*  where you just understand some of these are going to everyone wants to make it like oh I'm the
*  athlete who doesn't want to take drugs what about me right what about the two athletes who both
*  don't mind taking drugs right what it was supposed to do for them we'll say you can't take drugs why
*  imagine a world where they never did put any restrictions on testosterone replacement use
*  in Vitor Belfort still around okay but see I'm actually against TRT for a couple of reasons who
*  the fuck are you and what have you done with Luke for a couple of reasons one is that the
*  easiness of it was a little too much for me there should be some hurdles to taking some kind of drug
*  you should be able to lie like cleverly you should put some effort into your life there should be a
*  little bit of hurtling just be able to go to a doctor no that that's the problem if it's that
*  easy and it's that ubiquitous is that easy to hide you've not created enough stumbling blocks
*  and obstacles along the way to deter some usage the whole point is to deter the low-hanging fruit
*  that's what you really want to sort of but that doesn't that set it up so that the rich guys and
*  the guys that are the big camps that are funded by major sponsors they're the ones that are gonna
*  have the best athletes it's the opposite now is really have that now is what you have because the
*  other ones are super restricted they don't really have much of an opportunity to fight back against
*  any kind of other form of testing they're really sort of subject to it they can afford a lawyer
*  you are of the opinion and we don't need to name camps but the top camps employ scientists or
*  doctors or someone who knows how to get around the system I don't know what top camps I don't
*  know how it would work that way I know that like top top athletes more plates more dates guy I know
*  that guy looked at yoel romero yeah and paulo costa yeah and a bunch of stuff a bunch of stuff yeah
*  and again is everything he says gospel I don't think so but it's worth sort of his take on yoel
*  romero was that he's a genetic freak right but he got fucked by usada too yes he did right well so
*  did tim means right another guy who doesn't look like he's on steroids at all right there's a bunch
*  of guys a bunch of female fighters too right haven't they been popped sure for tainted supplements
*  sure it said they have no one protecting them yeah but it's also like you're not supposed to take
*  that stuff okay I mean listen I've dealt with fighters for a long time they're not the most
*  organized people in the world I love them god bless them they're the most inspiring people I
*  know preaching to the choir buddy I can't tell you how many times I'm like okay 1 p.m east coast time
*  we have an interview and they just they just oh they're like oh it was napping like you think
*  they're gonna take they're gonna look on the fucking bottle I mean come on no and let's be
*  honest also there's a lot of guys who say they took a tainted supplement when really they were
*  probably microdosing and they got busted right there's also that as well yeah there's there's
*  that as well so I think you have to look at two situations one do you want a professional sports
*  world like we have where people claim they care very much about health outcomes but they really
*  don't where people are obviously using in the NFL which by the way I mean how do you get through
*  an NFL season without growth hormone I would love to know probably very difficult to do that
*  okay but here's my point something is a brutal vicious game and then on the other side or you
*  can just you can balkanize it a little bit you can have divisions for older people you can have
*  divisions for people who don't want to take drugs and for the ones who do again does this solve all
*  the problems Joe it does not solve all the problems but it's a much more honest and a
*  policeable world when I talked to Roy Jones and talked about the Mike Tyson fight he told me that
*  they're testing that they're doing vada testing and I was like man like Roy's 51 and Mike is 54
*  and I'm like hmm boy I would have swore that's not the case if you looked at Mike's physique he
*  looks ripped he looks so shredded but he might be one of those outliers one of those rare Herschel
*  Walker type dudes that can be 54 years old and be shredded I mean there are guys like out that out
*  there that have just unbelievable genetics and maintain their physique deep into their 50s well
*  is what 45 I think something three he looks ridiculous I mean he's saying he's a he's a he's
*  the epitome of specimen he's a specimen do you know what happened with him once want to hear
*  this story I told it before forgive me if you've heard it folks he got a fracture I think it was
*  in Australia he had an orbital fracture and the after the fight doctor I think it was the Whitaker
*  fight doctors examine him and the doctor calls up the UFC and goes where did you get this guy
*  and he goes well yeah he's one of the UFC fighters he's like he's like this guy's a specimen he goes
*  yeah yeah he's amazing right he's a top fighter goes no no no no no no no no no no like I've never
*  seen a person like this he's like I've been doing I've been a doctor for decades he goes
*  his tendons in his eyes are three times larger than normal persons and he goes and that fracture is
*  already healing wow yeah and so Dana was telling me about this he was saying that you know Cubans
*  had this crazy athletic program and they were doing all kinds of experiments with people
*  and he thinks that they did some experiments with athletes to create super athletes like you
*  remember Karelin you know Karelin was they called him the experiment that was his that was his
*  nickname because his parents were both like five five five seven and he's a fucking giant of a
*  refrigerator who moves like a panther you know literally a 300 pound man who moves like a panther
*  and you know obviously Cuba had a deep relationship with Russia and if you've seen the
*  movie Icarus you've seen that movie right which is an amazing movie on doping like Russians don't
*  fuck around when it comes to doping I mean they had a very specific program no corner cutting
*  with them no corner cutting it was like super scientific and everyone's on board like you're
*  not going to compete on the natch like no no no no no we're here to win bitch and uh you know
*  the I don't know what they did to make Yoel Romero but that's not a normal human and everybody who
*  fights him says the same thing Luke Rockhold said it feels like he's made out of metal
*  it's like you fight the guy it's like he's made out of steel yeah here's the funny the guy so I
*  tore my labrum lifting weights uh maybe 10 years ago or something and uh the guy who ended up doing
*  my surgery well by the way the MMA fan he loved talking about it whenever I would go see him
*  uh was the previous orthopedic surgeon years ago for at the time the Washington Redskins they've
*  since changed their name but NFL football team and I was like what are they like like cutting
*  these dudes open he's like this is exactly what he told me he goes they're not built like you and
*  me you know he was like saying you cut them open and you can't believe that the muscle fibers look
*  the way they look or that the tendons are attached with the same kind of like tensile strength
*  whatever the proper terminology is he's like it was just like everything you understand about the
*  human uh anatomy you know it from a sort of averaged position and then you see these herculean
*  monsters and you're like oh so that's what mothra looks like when you cut them open or some shit
*  well that's what I'm thinking is going to happen eventually in MMA if the money does get higher
*  you're going to see more of these next level yoel romero type athletes because they exist more in
*  NFL and NBA like imagine you know a guy like LeBron James fighting in MMA who's like just a
*  perfect specimen imagine these Michael Jordans imagine these next level athletes which
*  unfortunately a lot of those guys wind up going to sports like basketball or baseball
*  because there's more money there's more money in those sports you don't get kicked in the face
*  you know and then the football guys like there's more money in football like you can make a fucking
*  insane amount of money in football like i was just reading about some guy whose contract was
*  like 400 million dollars like some crazy shit like football yeah that's i'm not sure who that
*  would be who's the who's the most who's got the most money in football patrick mahomes maybe it
*  was baseball this is how little i pay attention to sports you're missing out man there was an
*  article yesterday about a guy who is getting his full contract in baseball there's a lot of money
*  so like 300 million yeah maybe it's like bro have you seen dk metcalf no holy who's that guy a
*  motherfucker yeah you think yoel romero is a specimen can you pull up really yeah have we
*  talked about him before pull up pull up dk metcalf at the combine oh my god
*  here's the thing i disagree with you halfway which is to say to the extent you get this kind
*  of athlete you're probably going to get on average better results the one caveat look at
*  this motherfucker bro he's a he's a joe joe he's a pass catcher how much does he weigh
*  64229 what was his what was his 229 yeah dude what were his what were his combine numbers his
*  bench in his uh his run he is oh my god six three two the one percent the one percent body fat is
*  not real but he did run a 433 he benched 225 27 times he had a 40 inch vertical look at that
*  motherfucker he can't be one percent body fat no that part's that part's not real holy shit is he
*  shredded look at that i mean try try tackling this fucking wall the thing about fighting though that
*  separates the men from the boys is the mind right and the difference between being able to perform
*  in a sport and being able to fight another man is trying to separate you from consciousness is a very
*  different thing it's like some guys just can't rise to the occasion this is the big thing he did
*  last week while he went viral he is right here watch him at the top of the screen i'm gonna start
*  over again though watch him at the top of the screen here top of the screen here he comes middle
*  look at him run this fucking guy down oh my god look at him dude he's 240 pounds and he runs the
*  guy down that's very fast also he's not yeah by the way the guy he's running down is much smaller
*  than yeah super wide receiver super fast that's amazing that's amazing it's just amazing how many
*  times these guys get tackled and it doesn't just rip their fucking legs sorry it was an interception
*  so it'd be a cornerback who got this i believe watch dk metcalf he goes for it misses and then
*  comes back around and chases this fucking guy down that's amazing it's unheard of for a guy this big
*  there he is there's dk right here
*  is done running look at him fucking smoking look at him go dude dk metcalf is so impressive
*  oh my you ever watch the combine amazing so when the combine comes on dude i'll i'll turn off
*  everything my wife is like you're watching a bunch of dudes run i'm like not dudes heroes superheroes
*  but to your to your point about the uh the fighting yeah mark ellis you remember mark ellis
*  yeah like he was like a division one national champion wrestler he had a i think he had one
*  fight in pro elite and he was like no mass yeah this is the one caveat i don't know about dk
*  mccuff or anybody else but you see these guys and they're just like in terms of athletic ability
*  they're they're beyond comparison yeah but there is something about two things one people i was
*  like oh with with fighting it's like you have to learn how to like be punched in the face
*  yes that's half of it the other half is and i think people overlook this
*  you have to have something constitutionally where you're willing to hurt another person
*  and not everyone has that not to the same amount that is not an automatic response it might be in
*  the case of an emergency you have to solve a puzzle you have to solve a puzzle and reason through
*  it yeah there's a lot going on there's creativity that's involved in fighting that may not be
*  involved in a lot of other sports that are just pure strength and speed and athleticism and
*  and a knowledge of moves and understanding of positions but there's a different thing
*  that's going on where you're trying to create an opening when you're trying to create an opening
*  fighting you know there's there's just there's things that people can do in fighting that
*  also you have to commit to that at a very young age if you want to be elite like you can be a guy
*  like greg hardy who has a reasonably successful career as a heavyweight just because he's a tough
*  motherfucker who hits really hard he's a very good athlete but are you ever going to be francis
*  ingano you know are you ever going to be stipe miocic are you ever going to be it's like there's
*  there's a level that you reach where you only reach that level if you've been training it
*  most of your life and particularly for striking for some reason there's exceptions to that rule
*  where some people can figure it out but not in boxing in boxing it's very rare that someone even
*  picks it up after their teenage years and reaches elite world championship level right there's a
*  something about the timing and the understanding of it's like to someone who's looking at on the
*  outside it's a guy trying to punch another guy the guy's trying to punch you you're trying to
*  punch him but there's a there's so much more to it that's why a guy like floyd mayweather always
*  wins like he's got a vocabulary that's just fucking volumes and volumes of books and you got a little
*  pamphlet you got a little pamphlet of ideas you know and he's standing in front of you with
*  shoulders like this and you think ah i see i can hit this guy you you don't have a fucking chance
*  in hell he's so many steps ahead of you that's who you saw in the connor McGregor fight he just
*  slowly lures connor into his web and so relaxed and composed and eventually starts piecing him up
*  and taking him out but there's there's levels that i think you only achieve if you start while your
*  body's developing there's something that happens when your body's maturing and growing with striking
*  when you that's where the real speed and timing and power comes from and again there's there's
*  exceptions just there's some people that are just sensational athletes they just learn like i don't
*  think gilbert bern started out as a striker i don't think he started out doing any striking i think
*  he learned how to do that shit as a world champion jiu-jitsu player who got into mma but he's a rare
*  freak you know but it's also he's already a champion martial artist or also already knows
*  how to smash men right there's a thing about that there's a thing about knowing how to solve a puzzle
*  knowing how to figure a man out getting a hold of a man's neck and putting him to sleep he knows how
*  to do that already so to figure out that i just needed to know how to put knuckles to chin and
*  he's already a fast guy he's already explosive guy and the dedication that allows someone to get to
*  a world championship level in jiu-jitsu it's the same thing in striking if he just puts the time in
*  and has the focus the intensity and and figures out how to put end with the right coaching which
*  is also huge the wrong coaching can set a guy back for i mean it could ruin you the wrong coaching
*  can ruin you someone with bad ideas and piss poor strategy and execution you can fucking or you can
*  get you can run into a guy like duke rufus and he can create a world champion out of you i mean
*  it's it's there's so many factors that play into it but if you can get a guy who has that mentality
*  has a fighter's mentality a person who wants to risk it all you know and not have the protection
*  of other players not have the the you know the caveat well you know the team we didn't put it
*  together defensively and we'll be back next sunday bitch there's no next sunday when you get head
*  kicked right you know like you're not fighting again for a long time you get you're suspended
*  for 90 days you're not even supposed to be sparring you know and then when you come back
*  you're probably still going to be a little bit fucked up from that fight there's a thing about
*  fighting that separates us from all the other sports i hate to say it again but i call it high
*  level problem solving with dire physical consequences is different than anything else
*  because it's it's there's so much going on it's just two people and there's so much going on in
*  that in that than those exchanges and it's so hard to read unless you know it and understand it
*  that's like the ground game like one of the things that meant so much to me when i first started
*  doing commentary was expressing what i know about the ground game so that a person who's never
*  trained at all can understand it so when people are going through positions and like a guy gets
*  to a position and i know they're close to a finish or i know they've reached a pivotal point
*  where the i would get excited and explain it it was so i wanted to explain it so descriptively
*  like now he's got to get the arm and once he gets that arm past his leg now he's fucked and
*  and being able to do that to people so they could piece it together and watch it at home like
*  oh when kabib mounted him and sat on top of him and put his leg around oh that's how he's setting
*  up the triangle and then he finishes justin with it oh i wanted to be able to show people what i
*  feel when i see a guy do a mounted triangle in a fucking world championship mma fight and then
*  find out the guy had a fucking broken foot when he did it madness just madness not every baseball
*  player can do that not every soccer player can do that not every football player can do that
*  it takes a man with a gladiator's mind like kabib never come at off to do something like that that's
*  a unusual human it's the one percent of the one percent well i would say for me uh i i often view
*  the combative arts like a language which is why learning them five six seven that's actually
*  teach someone a second language right if you teach them at two they don't actually pick it up you
*  have to wait a few years and then they begin to get it and then they learn to speak you can't force
*  it on them when they're young yeah i've tried with my daughter it's not you know
*  she prefers apple to manzana we're working on it but okay the point being is you know you wait
*  till they're five six seven and they begin to begin to get absorbing and then once it becomes
*  the language and the fluency and everything begins at the by the time they're 14 15 16 20
*  21 my god the fluency is sort of incredible at that point so that's part of it wrestling is the
*  same as boxing in that way you have to start very very young to actually want to compete later on
*  but the other part is like the problem solving i would say that someone who's like a quarterback
*  dude that is high level problem solver sure you know it's not the same kind of situation where
*  and this is why again everyone's going to focus on a different aspect of fighting that really
*  appeals to them the problem solving is interesting that's why like adesanya faking and fainting
*  because he keeps him at a distance so he can watch everything i hate to have favorite fighters but
*  right now he's my favorite guy to watch next to kabib because there's something about style bender
*  man especially that adesanya the uh polo costa fight god damn did he shut down the hype he changed
*  the way i broke down fights ever tell you this and i guess i haven't because the first time i
*  talked to you but i was just thinking about this the other day he did something in the silva fight
*  where i was watching and i was like i don't know what the fuck he is doing here i can't make it
*  like if you just watch it even in slow motion i can't make heads or tails of it like i don't
*  understand what what the what the point of it is so because of because of him now when i break down
*  fights i actually start i go round by round and i make notes every time any kind of strike lands
*  or misses and then i begin to go back and i piece together a narrative based on what if there is a
*  narrative sometimes there's not but more often than not there is about what is happening and i had to
*  do it from this stance and then that stance because he was switching stances close distance
*  far distance inside distance he is so meticulous and so thoughtful but so effortless that i had to
*  peel everything apart before i could even begin to comprehend it people go and look at that finally
*  go oh well he only won 29 28 that's not the story there the story there is that yes it was a little
*  bit on the defensive side that is true but he is so smart and so is the smartest fighter we have
*  right now i think i agree he is so smart that he can watch what is happening set things up
*  and do things in terms of manipulation distance timing and everything else and a trap setting to
*  the nth degree that there's he doesn't have a peer in that particular i really enjoyed your breakdown
*  the paul costa fight thanks yeah particularly that one where you you you broke down how he
*  pointed the fake like he faked pointed out that paul fell for it and then kicked his leg right
*  afterwards you bid on it dude he fucked that guy's mind up afterwards like you signed a contract
*  signed it's like contract contract did you just not watch what happened right you got torn apart
*  for two rounds where you landed up two body kicks and one leg kick for two rounds and you got
*  dismantled and and and dropped a left hook and then beaten down and dry humped that was the and
*  you're talking about a guy in paulo costa that everyone was terrified of the guy who walked down
*  yoel romero the guy who was smashing everybody they put in front of him he's a destroyer i mean
*  paulo costa is a fucking terrifying force super terrifying hadesson you just had all the answers
*  and he knew he had all the answers coming in what do you think about adesanya jones where are you
*  i love it yeah everyone loves it what do you how competitive do you think it is well he's got to
*  get past yon bullhobish first of all that that motherfucker hits hard he hits scared when he put
*  out dominic reyes i was like holy shit what he ended with a weird punch too a weird left hand
*  over the top that fucked him up he's a beast man and he's another guy that was killing himself
*  making 185 right goes up to 205 and starts nuking motherfuckers he's a dangerous dangerous guy you
*  can't make any mistakes with that guy gustafson out wrestled him for three rounds and at the time
*  i remember people like oh he had to wrestle him he ain't that good i'm like in retrospect
*  that's a great win by gustafson a great win a great win yeah look you know that that guy moving
*  up to 205 is going to be some growing pains but now he's the champion and he knows that he can
*  nuke a guy like dominic reyes who went five hard rounds with john jones and in your eyes won the
*  fight against the only time i've ever scored against jones the only time fucking tight it was
*  tight it was arguable for sure um i'd have to go over and watch it again if i wanted to score
*  but i remember thinking god damn this guy is a head deep going and then john came on strong in
*  the fourth and fifth but he nuked that guy he nuked reyes and and it's not like reyes wasn't in the
*  fight but when he started hitting that left kick to the body and left that gigantic brute you'll
*  realize like this dude hits so hard and his game is all power he's just a big power striker and and
*  just durable and tough just a bad motherfucker he's impressive because i had i had dominic reyes on my
*  show after the the loss to john jones and we talked about his game plan and his game plan was pretty
*  smart if you think about it which is you're not going to barrel down on john it's really not going
*  to happen john i think his offense is not the same as it used to be but his defense if you look at
*  the numbers and just what the tape shows you john's defense is excellent why why do you think his
*  offense not what it used to be what do you think is different so do yourself a favor if you have
*  five pass five pass i just i can't say enough good things about five pass i think they need to update
*  their interface but in terms of like the service it does for someone like me like because you think
*  you see a fight in your head one way then you go back and you watch it like oh my god i totally
*  forgot half this shit you know so it's a great way to remind yourself but if you go back and you
*  look he had a certain kind of wrestling dominance from the shogun to the rishad really even up through
*  most portions of his career that has begun to wane is his takedown ability has gone from about the mid
*  50s a little higher than that let's say the 60s to about the 30s it's dropped off a cliff what do
*  you think's happened the game has just gotten better i mean if you think about it dominic reyes
*  didn't make his pro debut until 2014 now john jones was the fucking man already by then right
*  i mean long since been the man by 2014 so how could it be that a guy can be training that long
*  at least make it that competitive on paper it's because best practices have gotten much much better
*  so what what dominic reyes wanted to do was create motion the idea was to get john moving
*  because if he's stationary or he's barely down on you he's much harder to hit but to the extent
*  you can get the guy moving he's open to the body and to the legs now that's a hard way to win
*  because really the head contest is what wins and loses fights more often than not whether or not
*  that's fair it's just it's hard to win a fight on body shots unless you drop them but i thought he
*  did win it so he tried the same kind of thing against jan blachowicz he was trying to bait
*  motion he was trying to bait activity blachowicz no sold it completely he was just standing there
*  going nope not but not playing any of this bullshit whatsoever yeah come close get nuked
*  and so reyes couldn't he had a he had a no i don't i don't think he was expecting that i think he had
*  a hard time adjusting well also when he smashed reyes's nose like reyes is in deep trouble he
*  had shattered his nose before that big overhand he's just a beast of a man i think that's an
*  interesting fight to watch style bender fight him and apparently that's the next fight for style
*  bender's gonna be at light heavyweight i don't know if it's gonna be for the title does he say
*  oh yeah it is gonna be for the title is this confirmed no no it hasn't been confirmed jamie
*  so so dana white announced it we've not had a full-on confirmation but you know style bender
*  did an interview with submission radio there's a couple guys out of australia and he was talking
*  like it was a done deal so i've been that you know they haven't formally announced it but i would
*  i am very interested to see that because bohovich has that power style and style bender is in my
*  opinion the most sophisticated striker the sport's ever seen and he's so clever and you look no
*  further than the paulo costa fight i mean paulo costa is a fucking gorilla he's just a attacking
*  smashing dude and he he had nothing for him he had nothing for him and then afterwards to see paulo
*  costa i was injured i was this i was that signed a contract it's like bro stop talking take away
*  his iphone stop stop talking what is happening here opens as heavy favorite over ufc light
*  heavyweight champion jan bohovich oh my goodness you know what though but bohovich has been slept
*  on forever that's not there's nothing new there and i've been wrong about him a million times too
*  you know yeah well it's very very interesting can you pull up his record though real quickly
*  last thing on this can you pull up blachowicz's record because he here's a guy who i think lost
*  the majority of his first six ufc fights i think he lost like three or four of them or some shit
*  he had like a really not a great run at first but dude you know what's amazing these guys like
*  michael bissping or whatever it's one thing to persevere in the moment it's another one to have
*  just like long-term relentlessness yeah so look go scroll down here if you can for just a second
*  go to his early fights so he starts he starts there he wins against illyar latifi which is a nice win
*  and then he loses to manoa and anderson he beat igor pukajak then he loses to gustafson and
*  commons so he's losing four of his first six but then he's like you know what fuck all you hoes
*  and then he just started he lost to tiago santos i believe that was the last fight at 85 right and
*  he was a beast okay no harm no foul and then he kos rockhold and then the jacarri fight was not
*  great no but the cory anderson fight is a perfect example cory anderson bodied him in the first
*  fight you know the fact that he KO'd him with one punch like that and that is crazy yeah that was
*  that was a really interesting thing because cory can take a shot too and cory was coming off of
*  that big win off of johnny walker you know it's look there's a lot of great fights you know what
*  i'm really interested in alex perrera alex perrera who is the glory uh i believe he's a two division
*  champion volaton yeah he's what is he fighting for lfa he's fighting for i think that's right
*  yeah he's fucking terrifying and he's the last guy to KO adesanya he's on my radar i'm really
*  interested he's a champ champ over at glory too he's terrifying that guy's fucking terrifying
*  that guy is almost like you want to grab his arm and feel what it feels like like what are you made
*  out of that motherfucker just puts people into orbit he he he kos everybody i mean when he knocked
*  out jason willness watch this flying knee ko boom and willness by the way a beast by the way beat
*  adesanya i believe and it was a close it shouldn't have okay i gave it to adesanya i gave it out of
*  sonya as well but it was close enough but you look at that i mean this is but this is this is
*  perrera look at this shit but he does this to everybody is this something about this guy it's
*  like you you see him hit guys and it looks like normal punches and they just go unconscious like
*  that shit i mean these are world-class kickboxers and this motherfucker just puts them into another
*  dimension he just put out an instructional with bjj fanatics have you seen it no but he's been
*  training a lot with glover tochera he's in connecticut training with glover and i think
*  is one of the reasons why glover has made this resurgence like glover has looked sensational as
*  of late i love glover to share i love glover and i think one of the reasons why glover at 40 plus
*  years old has made this resurgence is he's training with perrera i think that i mean look
*  iron sharpens iron we all know that and there's something about exchanging ideas with one of the
*  best kickboxers on planet earth not just the best kickboxer but a weirdly powerful one he's a freak
*  man there's something about perrera he he's astonishing and i think him moving into the lfa
*  and if he gets through a few fights there and you know i have zero idea what his ground game is zero
*  idea what his wrestling zero idea what his takedown defense is but he nukes motherfuckers i mean in a
*  weird way i mean when he knocked out um style bender it was like jesus one left hook he does
*  it to everybody i know with the big gloves he's got a lot of different ways to do it it's not like
*  djante with just this oh he does it with everything knees kicks punches everything you name yeah and
*  now he can throw elbows he couldn't even throw elbows in glory now he can throw elbows and he
*  can grab you and throw knees everyone's gonna try and take this fucker down oh they have to you
*  fucking better you better you're standing up with that guy that's death that's death i know i'm just
*  like it's like i don't i want to get excited he beat he beat style bender twice in kickboxing
*  but i'm just by decision and by ko i'm just dying to see i understand how the rest of it looks
*  because of the well how old is he how old is alex i don't know he might be like 34
*  ish 35 i was there at the last man standing tournament when he was uh right before he peaked
*  he was he was pre-peak at that point um and he was still a formidable 33 he is still got some time
*  and it literally completely depends on how much time he has spent on the ground how much time he's
*  spent drilling takedown defense how much time because it's relatively late to enter the game
*  in mma you know he's had a couple of mma fights but as a kick it's just a fucking shame that he
*  can't get the love and the money as a kickboxer because as a kickboxer you're just watching
*  executions like when does he land i know and gloria was ashamed because did you watch the uh
*  still exists i know but uh they had their they had some issues obviously due to the pandemic but
*  did you watch the uh batter harry and rico verhoeven yes crazy fuck that was so fun that
*  was weird such a great job how how weird was the stoppage like he fall he throws a wheel kick and
*  then didn't get injured in the process his ankle yeah but i mean just the fucking feel of it you've
*  been to the netherlands i'm sure right no i haven't never never you don't know what you're
*  missing really uh i would say it's funny i tell this to the dutch and they're like you're totally
*  overselling it so i'm sure that i am but i went there with my wife and you know she comes from
*  places my wife was an immigrant so she came from a different background and i have a different
*  background and we went there and we both looked at each other and we go this is how society should
*  be organized really yeah it's a homogenous society to a large degree obviously part of the reason why
*  they have some problems is because to the extent that it's not homogenous they have some issues but
*  just the way you see the municipal planning and how life looks like in the in the cities there
*  it's peaceful and it's happy it's like how did a place that is so tranquil and so lovable and so
*  nice produce you savage motherfuckers i mean it's just shocking i know the story because of the
*  dutch went down to thailand and brought it back and blah blah blah but dude it is i it's a i if i
*  if someone's like you have to leave america because it got set on fire where are you gonna go
*  canada a little too cold i'm going to the fucking netherlands really yeah wow that's where i'm
*  headed well they certainly have an insane history of kickboxes right rob cayman or nesto hoost you
*  know i mean there's just so many endless yeah so many raymond deckers ramon deckers is like one of
*  the all-time greats and he may be even more impressive because he was small he was the size
*  of the ties and he would go up there and light them on fire he was they didn't like that too much dude
*  he fought so hard he shattered his ankle and had to have it fused so like and he still fought and
*  still kicked with it like you can't kick with his ankle you'll have to have your foot amputated he's
*  like fuck you just kept kicking with it he was an animal he was like literally the gold standard for
*  uh european western guys who went over and fought the time what's the word forong forang what's the
*  time that's what they call it something like that but it's amazing too like you know one thing about
*  the dutch is kind of funny if you've picked up on this the dutch will fight their teammates without
*  a whole lot of consternation especially in kickboxing where it'll be like you wait you're from
*  mike's gym and you're from mike's gym how come you're fighting they're like business you know
*  they're not personal i'm like yeah in america that's like the most personal they don't seem to
*  have a hard time getting knocked out and getting back in there again either which brings you back
*  to alistair ovreem who's a dutchman who's just got this crazy record i mean you want to talk about a
*  guy who's had what an insane record right k1 grand prix champion dream heavyweight champion
*  strike force heavyweight champion at the same time yeah and he's just gotten so close to ufc gold
*  you know hurt steepay dropped him had him hurt and just eventually wound up losing the fight
*  but he's a guy when he was juicy you couldn't stop him when he beat alistair or when he beat
*  brock lesnar yeah that's as juicy as the world gets do you remember when he was fighting in like
*  dreaming k1 at that time what michael sciavello said about his back no what he said he said you
*  could screen a movie on it that's perfect dude when he fought todd duffy i'm like oh my god
*  when but when he fought brock lesnar that's probably the most impressive because he
*  he muscled brock lesnar around like brock lesnar was the guy and obviously brock lesnar coming off
*  of diverticulitis he had his giant section of his small is a small intestine something like the
*  digestive organs yeah some serious stomach surgery right so he's got gut surgery and not
*  many months removed from that less than a year he's getting kicked by alistair over him i remember
*  alistair hit him with his shin to the body he seemed like grab his body and go down then get
*  beaten up but it was the way he beat him up before that it was just everything about it he muscled
*  him he moved him around he's like and he was just the that was the ream when he was like full uber
*  ream when he was 265 pounds shredded built like a tank looked like a comic book superhero
*  god damn if you want to make an argument for steroids that's the argument well again he
*  should be doing it against other people who know what they're in for i'm totally okay with that but
*  well don't you think brock knows what he's in yeah i mean again you think i have sympathy for
*  brock lesnar in this case no we're talking juicy uh but here's a point about over him is i remember
*  when um when ronda got knocked out by holly and max kellerman was on twitter at the time love max
*  and max had said you know i don't think ron is ever going to recover from this mentally and at
*  the time i was thinking like max you don't know shit now he ended up being right but the reason
*  why i felt that way was because i had seen guys like over him get viciously ko'd or michael bisman
*  or michael bisman come right back some people can come they are special special guys man yeah
*  some people can come back and some people are never the same um before we wrap this up there
*  was a few other things you were saying about the ufc that i know that we this has been so much fun
*  we've been going on these different rants but there was a few things specifically that i think
*  we'd be doing a disservice if we didn't cover one of them you think is usada which uh i can agree
*  with you i just don't kind of make one final point about that wrap up on this the one thing i want
*  folks to understand is if you look at the history of anti-doping and again the scholarship on this
*  is quite clear pre-usada ufc i mean long into the 20th century and then really beginning around 1968
*  the the way in which anti-doping has moved itself forward is through there's been reports in the
*  media that drive further forms of hysteria and then that forces the institutions to act and so
*  you have to understand you can't talk about a anti-doping without media hysteria around drugs
*  and b a lot of times when you see these developments in anti-doping protocol it's
*  institutions protecting themselves like when the ufc really went to usada was it on behalf of the
*  athletes if you want to believe that you can i cannot say it is wrong but what the scholarship
*  is pretty clear about an anti-doping is that institutions do it for their own protection
*  which i understand there's nothing wrong with the ufc being like you know what if we have a scandal
*  here we're gonna get fucked if we don't do more i totally get it but that's a part of the argument
*  that deserves to be noted and should not be forgotten yeah i don't know what the argument
*  was that forced them to institute usada trt trt caused all the problems it was an over trt was a
*  problem the question is how you solve it right and we went overboard in my judgment that's the
*  problem i think we had now that's debatable but that is that is the cause of everything do you
*  think that a certain level of trt would be acceptable like a doctor administered in a tr i i tend to
*  think that like that it's such an uh oh listen if you're going to have a system where folks are
*  going to use then the way to screen that is through health outcomes right so you're looking at um
*  forms of screening not so much for what they're taking but how you know their blood enzymes look
*  and digestive organs and what kind of damage they're taking and blah blah blah to me trt is
*  one of these things where it's like um we're gonna make it super easy and we're going to
*  like i said the readiness of it is too easy for me is is part of the issue that testing is random
*  and that testing is you know you might get tested four times a year you might get tested 10 times
*  a year no one knows no one can tell what if there was a way where every fighter had like something
*  like almost like an app and it it's somehow or another you put it on you and it screens you
*  like there's something that you could do where it can't be faked you check in maybe you check in on
*  your computer like a facetime thing and it does something like if there was a way i'm obviously
*  i don't know what i'm talking about but if there was some sort of technology that allowed them to
*  see every day twice a day check you in the morning check you at night okay luke it looks like you're
*  good you're like you're you're in the range everything's fine so a couple things it's like
*  every employee that i know who's not an athlete gets to have time off except an athlete we ask
*  certain things of athletes that we don't ask of anyone else in the world and the reason why is
*  supposed to be to combat these harms but if you can't prove to me that these harms are existing
*  or that you're meaningfully doing anything about it then why are we engaging in these privacy
*  invasions what kind of a wasting time with connor mcgregor when he's he's in on in a
*  fucking yacht somewhere they show up in a buggy like hey man you gotta give you a piss test he's
*  like i'm fucking retired right right so there's a lot of problems there it's like if you can't
*  prove what you're doing yeah or stopping why are we engaging all these privacy invasions but it
*  gets to a larger point remember when tim kennedy got back from practice and he didn't want to get
*  ringworm so he showered and you saw the folks were like we got to test you once we're here we can't
*  like give you time so they watched the fucking guy showered which is deranged to the nth degree
*  yeah but the point being is here's what anti-doping folks don't want to tell you
*  there is a natural tension between what privacy exists and what solutions there are and there's
*  a lot of good solutions or not good solutions there's a lot of better solutions if you just
*  decide that people don't have any right to privacy you decide that you have some options at that
*  point but if you at all care about athletes and what they are entitled to as human beings
*  um and what by the way problems might be like where's don't you have to look at a guy's dick
*  to make sure it's not rubber oh yeah you do you got he he showered with the curtain open and like
*  tim kennedy you know tim kennedy was like all balls and everything he's like watch my back come
*  watch my back but when you when you pee do they have to look at your dick i think they do look
*  at everything because you have the wizinator yeah yeah yeah and guys didn't kevin randleman do that
*  they said is non-human urine yeah it's like you have like a dead man's piss how did you do that
*  yeah i just it is weird whenever someone's allowed to look at your dick because they're
*  thinking you're gonna cheat how about you see if they're cheating first and then you go hey i gotta
*  see your dick next time right it just seems it seems like a first step to just look at your dick
*  while your pee is pretty crazy if you moralize doping which they have done if you moralize it
*  which is not a moral issue it's a strategic issue if you moralize it you've decided that it's a evil
*  worth combating to the point now uh well this is rotchenkov act is being floated through congress
*  yeah i mean do i think i am right about doping i think i have some right ideas but here's the
*  future of doping they're gonna start putting more and more people in jail this is the way it's all
*  headed because every time i've tried to make an argument everything has escalated i've just
*  noticed it's falling totally on deaf ears and i suspect it will be the same here even though i've
*  tried to make an honest argument they're gonna start putting people in jail and they already have
*  in europe to a degree now what they've done is they've carved out you're an athlete you won't
*  get put in jail but if you're anyone who's aided in that process you're gonna go but they're
*  eventually gonna realize what they've always realized which is that the punishment the
*  sociological research on this is pretty clear it's really not the punishment that really uh
*  concerns them it's the it's their um to what extent they'll be they'll be caught they think
*  they'll be caught but if you're rich and you can avoid it or you're willing to take risks because
*  that's inherently in the job that you're in you don't really think about these kinds of things
*  and by the way you might have good methods of uh evasion so they're gonna put people in jail and
*  i think honestly we're they're gonna put a lot of people in jail i think almost like we need a
*  separate podcast just about this and i feel like it almost should be a round table discussion
*  with like someone like you as a proponent of this someone like me who's i kind of see your point i
*  agree with you and maybe some doctors and maybe someone from usada that would argue against it
*  i think that would be an interesting discussion right because my my arguments against usada are
*  the josh barnett arguments you know the uh the tom lawler arguments this the arguments where you're
*  ruining guys careers and there's no repercussion and they're they're they're ruined financially
*  they lose so much money they don't get any of it back you've made mistakes it doesn't matter
*  and i get what you're doing i get you're trying to make the sport safer you're doing your job you
*  are hired to do it but is it the most effective use of time and resources right and also can you
*  prove what you're doing show me show me the results of what you have done and they will be like oh
*  but you know probabilistically we should rely on us i have never seen an institution in my life
*  more than anti-doping institutions who just will are begging you and frankly demanding of you to
*  take their word for it motherfucker show your work i have to show my work show your work when you say
*  show your work like what do you want to see prove to me that what you are doing is having an effect
*  and don't give me all this bullshit about well we can't really do this and we can't really do that
*  you are demanding money you are demanding that athletes give into privacy invasions you are
*  ruining people's careers which we've already shown so it better be fucking worth it this juice
*  better be worth the squeeze show me the squeeze what could possibly what could they possibly show
*  that would make it that's that is that is their concern that is not mine i do i the burden of
*  proof is not on me the only thing you could say is you've caught people and you stop people and
*  you could look at physique changes and saying yeah it means nothing means nothing means a lot of that
*  it means a little bit of that but i'm just saying you have anecdotal evidence yeah and what other
*  world can you say i've got anecdotal evidence for my broad-based claims i tell you go fuck yourself
*  there's no other world where you can do that except theirs i'm saying to you if what you are saying
*  is working and what you really believe in is true show your work if there was a lawsuit and if
*  someone won a substantial financial reward for some of these fuck-ups i think we'd see a big
*  change i think that that would make if if someone like tom lawler won in court and got really paid
*  because of this well they don't have money for that tom doesn't have money for that it's unfortunate
*  because that he's i think he's you know but john is the john john jones is the future right so the
*  the scholarship on this is clear if you want after this is over i'll give you a couple of things you
*  can read okay it's a little bit dense but it is i'll pretend to read it i'll skim it keep it on
*  your bookshelf because even if it's a reference tool you may be you may find some value in it
*  again you read the shit and you're like i had no idea i had no idea i had no idea it just keeps
*  going you know but uh what they found through scholarship is that um so they've upped the
*  punishments from a year to two years to four years so first of all someone explained to me why ufc
*  athletes are on olympic cycles number one number two that's number one so the second one is beyond
*  that um uh in in putting together the sort of um uh portfolio of of of punishments beyond the sort
*  of olympic cycle um i think i said this already like they there's no evidence that indicates that
*  the severity of it forces the behavior change it's only the sort of surveillance of it all as a
*  function of um sort of fear but you can only do that if you abridge the rights of athletes so the
*  point is this you'll hear them talk a lot about we have to protect the rights of clean athletes
*  clean athletes deserve to have their rights protected joe let me ask you a question how do
*  you protect the rights of clean athletes by overrunning the rights of athletes generally
*  that seems like a contradiction in terms doesn't it the ufc fighters did not sign up for it right
*  and you have a situation where john jones for example he got the whole torrento ball thing we
*  don't have to get into it but there's another athlete in the olympics elect from ukraine alexei
*  torracchiti had the exact same problem tested the b sample it was totally negligible amounts
*  and they took that fucking guy's gold medal from him so wait a second why do we have one standard
*  for the olympics we've got one standard for a private client for an underfunded organization
*  which is about 20 million is their budget for usada and results in this sort of different world
*  punishments john is the future because the research shows that the more severe punishment you get
*  the more that you have to take precautions to not fuck someone over right because if you're
*  going to ban a guy for eight years you're going to ban a guy for life man you better be damn sure
*  you're doing it but that has opened the door to fighters like john who have money and a legal team
*  and of course there may be the science on his side as well but it shows that you can take that
*  opportunity and you can say aha you were trying to ban me for four years man what is your evidence
*  and they can poke holes through all of it when your punishment is a year it doesn't really matter
*  what mitigating circumstance you can show well his case is so weird too because it showed positive
*  and then negative and then negative and positive but in such trace amounts there's no way he could
*  have tested it and then had it go out of his system in time so the argument is that he had
*  the long-term metabolite but not the short and medium term yeah so it's showing this weird
*  pulsating effect where it comes and goes particularly during weight cuts right which is
*  apparently what uh alexi uh tore a kitty had and he got fucked all right luke this is a lot of fun
*  man i'm glad we did this i think i talked too much no you were awesome it was great i really
*  appreciate it i appreciate you i appreciate your show i really enjoy your breakdowns i enjoy your
*  mma show i think you have a very unique perspective and uh thanks for coming man thanks for the invite
*  and uh let's do it again the whiskey was great happy to come on anytime it was fun thank you
*  thank you bye everybody
*  okay
