# Joe Rogan Experience #1990 - Bert Kreischer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6.0s)]
*  I love you to death. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10.0s)]
*  Brother, I love you way more than you'll ever love me and you know that I told you that last night. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=15.0s)]
*  That's a ridiculous thing to say to a person. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=20.0s)]
*  You changed my life immeasurably. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=23.0s)]
*  You changed mine too. We changed each other's lives. We really did. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=25.0s)]
*  I just get too much credit. It's all of us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=29.0s)]
*  It's like we did it all together. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=33.0s)]
*  We all did it together. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=36.0s)]
*  Without good friends, nobody really succeeds. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=38.0s)]
*  Because you don't appreciate it if it's just you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=42.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem fair. It seems all fucked up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=47.0s)]
*  I keep saying to people, you gotta surround yourselves with the motherfuckers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=51.0s)]
*  If you're talking about your friends as if you're the top dog, then you're with the wrong dudes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=56.0s)]
*  Someone said to me, you're always talking like you're not a great comic, your friends are so much better. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=62.0s)]
*  I go, they are. Look at who my fucking friends are. Are you fucking kidding me? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=66.0s)]
*  I surround myself by people that are way better than me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=69.0s)]
*  And then I just listen. Not listen a lot. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=74.0s)]
*  We all rise up together. It's the old expression. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=77.0s)]
*  The rising tide raises all boats. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=81.0s)]
*  It really does. It's good for everybody. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=84.0s)]
*  You want killers. We got into this because we love comedy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=88.0s)]
*  And now we're in it. And when you're in it, it's so scary. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=93.0s)]
*  It's so weird. It's so chaotic. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=96.0s)]
*  People are comparing themselves to other people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=98.0s)]
*  It causes all this totally unnecessary conflict. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=101.0s)]
*  If you just remember why you got it in the first place, you got it in the first place because you love to watch it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=105.0s)]
*  And then you did it and then you got selfish. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=112.0s)]
*  And you start thinking about yourself. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=115.0s)]
*  You start thinking about, I want to kill and I want to be better and I want to be the number one person. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=117.0s)]
*  Watch them where other people are in their career. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=120.0s)]
*  I don't have a 30 minute half hour special. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=122.0s)]
*  People get upset with people that they really don't have any conflict with in real life. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=124.0s)]
*  But in their mind, they associate that person with something negative because they feel bad when they think about them, because that person is more successful than them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=129.0s)]
*  It makes them feel bad. So they think that person's bad. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=137.0s)]
*  It's like a weird selfish way of thinking about stuff. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=141.0s)]
*  And every comic used to have that back in the day. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=145.0s)]
*  Dice was talking about how every comic would fuck every comic over and they would like do something that would fuck up your set. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=148.0s)]
*  And he was talking about what he did on Dangerfield's young comedian special. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=156.0s)]
*  Someone else on the show wanted to wear a leather jacket the day of a biker jacket, like the same jacket that Dice wears. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=167.0s)]
*  And Rodney stopped it. He put the kibosh on it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=168.0s)]
*  But the comics would always do that kind of shit to each other. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=170.0s)]
*  It was like that when I started. It's not like that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=173.0s)]
*  It's way less like that now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=176.0s)]
*  Like I feel like the amount of love I've gotten from comics these last couple weeks promoting the movie, the love I've gotten from them has made me feel good. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=178.0s)]
*  Like I get really nice texts from people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=191.0s)]
*  Even I was telling you, I'm going to name drop right away. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=193.0s)]
*  Chappelle was the fucking sweetest guy in the world. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=196.0s)]
*  He's the nicest guy of all time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=198.0s)]
*  He was the sweetest guy. I wanted to meet that guy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=200.0s)]
*  Joe, I wanted to meet him for so long because he's my favorite. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=203.0s)]
*  Out of all the comics when I moved to New York that I could watch, it was Chappelle the way he did it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=206.0s)]
*  It was like watching jazz. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=211.0s)]
*  And then Attelle was like almost like watching the fucking fish or like the dead. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=212.0s)]
*  And you're like, it's not jazz. I don't know what the fuck that is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=217.0s)]
*  But it's totally different. I don't understand it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=219.0s)]
*  Hedberg was like that. Those are the guys. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=221.0s)]
*  Geraldo, those were the... Patrice. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=223.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=225.0s)]
*  But Chappelle was like the great white... I told him that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=226.0s)]
*  I said, you're like a great white shark. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=228.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=230.0s)]
*  You don't see... [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=231.0s)]
*  Like you walk into a room and you're like, oh fuck, fuck. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=232.0s)]
*  And he goes, he was like, he was like, man, he was very nice. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=236.0s)]
*  He goes, you've always spoken very nice about me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=240.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, that's how it works. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=242.0s)]
*  Like when you're a cool person, people talk good about you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=244.0s)]
*  Yeah. It should be how it works. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=247.0s)]
*  But you know, you see people even talking shit about him. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=249.0s)]
*  I've seen people talk shit about him that are comics. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=252.0s)]
*  It's like, God damn it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=254.0s)]
*  You know what it is? You said it earlier. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=256.0s)]
*  It's transactional. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=259.0s)]
*  It's like they think that it's going to help put them over. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=260.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a weird thing that we all do. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=262.0s)]
*  Because social interaction is very much like a game sometimes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=264.0s)]
*  There's like moves and then there's counter moves. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=268.0s)]
*  And there's like you're trying to like get a better position. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=273.0s)]
*  And it's like a little social wrestling match sometimes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=277.0s)]
*  I've seen people do it like when you're a room full of famous people, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=281.0s)]
*  there's a couple types of people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=285.0s)]
*  There's people that work the room. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=286.0s)]
*  And then there's people like me who leave the room because I go, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=288.0s)]
*  I go, this is overwhelming me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=290.0s)]
*  This is too weird. I'm going to get too drunk. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=292.0s)]
*  I'm going to say something fucked up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=294.0s)]
*  It's too weird. It's too weird. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=295.0s)]
*  I know. It's like, God damn. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=298.0s)]
*  It's weird to be one. It's weird to be around them. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=301.0s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=305.0s)]
*  It's like we've all known each other for so long that like we know each other. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=308.0s)]
*  Whereas like, you know, you meet someone and they're already famous. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=313.0s)]
*  It's like, how much did they even let you in? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=318.0s)]
*  You know, it seems like a weird life. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=320.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=324.0s)]
*  I remember when all the fucking Ibermectican shit was going on with you [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=325.0s)]
*  and Georgia was like sitting at the table and she's on her phone and she goes, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=330.0s)]
*  Oh my God, do you know this guy? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=334.0s)]
*  And I went, yeah. She goes, really? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=336.0s)]
*  I said, you do too, dummy. She goes, who is he? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=338.0s)]
*  I go, the guy with the chicken. She goes, oh wait, I like that guy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=340.0s)]
*  I went, yeah, you're looking at your phone like you feel like it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=343.0s)]
*  And I think that's what happens is like you look at like a celebrity or someone [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=346.0s)]
*  and you brand them with the thing that you think on the outside. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=350.0s)]
*  I know I've been guilty of it. I talk shit about people before. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=352.0s)]
*  Just fucking around, just fucking around because you just don't think they'll never hear it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=355.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=359.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I'll give you a perfect one. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=360.0s)]
*  I used to say that I think I could beat up Stylebender. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=363.0s)]
*  If we were drinking, we had to drink the same amount of beers and then get in the cage. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=368.0s)]
*  We each had to drink 12 beers and get in the cage. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=372.0s)]
*  And it was a joke. I was fucking around with Tommy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=374.0s)]
*  I never thought I'd meet Stylebender. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=377.0s)]
*  I never thought that motherfucker rolls up to my show in New Zealand [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=380.0s)]
*  and first of all, he's way bigger than you think. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=386.0s)]
*  He's way bigger than you think. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=389.0s)]
*  And his hands are huge and they're soft. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=392.0s)]
*  And the first thing he does, Joe, is he grabs my arm to like tap me up [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=396.0s)]
*  and he throws a knee and he grabs me by the back of the neck [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=400.0s)]
*  and he goes, you still think you could fuck me up? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=403.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm so sorry. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=406.0s)]
*  But you know what? You know what? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=408.0s)]
*  That guy is the coolest motherfucker, like the coolest. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=411.0s)]
*  I mean, he's one of my motherfuckers where I go, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=416.0s)]
*  he treated everyone as if he wasn't the middleweight champion of the world. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=420.0s)]
*  He treated him as if he was just some guy that was into comic books and into anime. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=424.0s)]
*  And he met Jared Hess, the director of Napoleon Dynamite, was at my show. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=429.0s)]
*  And he geeked out. He was like, oh, you did Napoleon Dynamite? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=433.0s)]
*  And Jared Hess is going, this is Israel Adesanya. Like, holy shit. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=437.0s)]
*  And then Joe and Izzy, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=441.0s)]
*  I'm sorry if I talk too much sometimes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=445.0s)]
*  We end up at a bar at like three in the fucking morning. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=448.0s)]
*  And he is, I'm fated. I don't know if he was drinking too much at all. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=452.0s)]
*  I don't even know if he's drinking. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=455.0s)]
*  But we get pretty lit in a bar at three in the morning in New Zealand. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=458.0s)]
*  And he stands up and I stand up with him back to back shirtless, both of us. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=463.0s)]
*  And we challenge everyone in the bar to a fist. Oh, you have it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=468.0s)]
*  Oh, this is what he challenging every in the bar. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=472.0s)]
*  Who won it? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=481.0s)]
*  What are you doing? You're starting to fight, challenging a bar to fight. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=485.0s)]
*  And this is in another country. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=489.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ, Bert, we were fucking dude. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=492.0s)]
*  This motherfucker is the coolest guy in the fucking world. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=496.0s)]
*  He literally is. He stands up and he goes, who has that? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=500.0s)]
*  He's one of the coolest guys that's ever lived. It's on his Twitter. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=504.0s)]
*  Oh, it's on his Twitter? Oh shit. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=507.0s)]
*  He stands up and he goes, his first words out of his mouth, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=509.0s)]
*  I'll kill every motherfucker in the room for this man right here. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=512.0s)]
*  So then you know my shirt comes off. I go, I thought we were doing a Steve Harvey bit. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=516.0s)]
*  You ever seen Steve Harvey talk about his wife? No. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=520.0s)]
*  Oh, it'll make you cry because I know how much you love your wife. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=523.0s)]
*  His wife's name is Marjorie. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=528.0s)]
*  I thought Stylepinder was doing a Steve Harvey bit because Steve Harvey has this moment where [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=532.0s)]
*  he's doing an award show and he hears a song and he goes, oh, I'm having me a moment. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=538.0s)]
*  And he goes, that's our song. And then it's a cool moment. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=544.0s)]
*  He goes, she's mine. Oh, this is it. This is it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=548.0s)]
*  This will make you cry, man. I mean, I get emotional watching this. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=552.0s)]
*  I just had a moment. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=555.0s)]
*  And that's me and my wife's song too. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=558.0s)]
*  I met her 86, 87 when the song came out. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=561.0s)]
*  Then God gave her back to me in 2005. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=568.0s)]
*  I put her name on the back. Man, you understand me. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=572.0s)]
*  That's mine right there. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=579.0s)]
*  Yeah, I own you and you own me. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=582.0s)]
*  I will kill everybody in here about your ass. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=586.0s)]
*  Please understand that about the way I love you, Marjorie Elaine. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=590.0s)]
*  You understand me. I kill everybody in here. I swear to God. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=595.0s)]
*  I thought he was doing. I thought he was doing it because he goes, ask the Lord about me. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=599.0s)]
*  I kill every motherfucking idiot. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=605.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. You thought stylebender was doing that? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=608.0s)]
*  Because Leanne sends me Steve Harvey clips and she had just said it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=612.0s)]
*  And I thought he must have seen the clip. It must be going viral. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=615.0s)]
*  So I thought he was doing stylebender. So I go, I can't have a motherfucker hitting it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=619.0s)]
*  He's mine and I'm him. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=623.0s)]
*  We started going, I thought he was doing Steve Harvey. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=626.0s)]
*  And then we start going table to table, Joe. We go table to table, challenging motherfuckers. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=629.0s)]
*  Who wants it? Look, these look at these big dudes behind them. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=634.0s)]
*  These big Samoan guys. We're like, who wants it? Who wants it? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=637.0s)]
*  Bro, this could have gone horribly wrong. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=641.0s)]
*  I was challenging the female tables. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=644.0s)]
*  What if there was rugby players there or something? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=647.0s)]
*  He's the middleweight champion of the world. I'm going to stand my fucking ground. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=650.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so dangerous. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=654.0s)]
*  We ended up buying the whole bar shots. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=655.0s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=658.0s)]
*  Three times. Filled them up. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=659.0s)]
*  Fuck, round them up. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=661.0s)]
*  That must have been a drunk place. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=662.0s)]
*  It was. And then he texted me the next morning. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=664.0s)]
*  Like, boom, he's out. He's out. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=667.0s)]
*  I don't think he drinks as much as I do. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=669.0s)]
*  And that dude, I'll tell you, I'm going to ride or die for him. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=672.0s)]
*  He was the nicest. We sat and talked. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=675.0s)]
*  We just talked about something really important in life is celebrating. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=677.0s)]
*  Celebrating victories. I love the way he does that. I really do. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=682.0s)]
*  When he has a victory, he goes on a celebration tour. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=686.0s)]
*  And I feel like the universe then fucking is set right. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=690.0s)]
*  Like, Leanne has a phrase. It's called earn your Mondays. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=696.0s)]
*  Right. So like, I'm going to get emotional telling this. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=702.0s)]
*  It's a cool fucking thing. It's earn your Mondays. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=705.0s)]
*  It means bust your ass all fucking weekend for us comics. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=708.0s)]
*  All weekend, all weekend. And do so well, you earn your Monday. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=711.0s)]
*  You don't have to pick up the phone. You don't have to do a fucking thing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=715.0s)]
*  You can just fucking sit back in the cut and go, I earned my Monday. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=717.0s)]
*  Like Amy Schumer's movie Trainwreck did really well, right? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=720.0s)]
*  It's opening week. And that's when Leanne said it the first time. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=725.0s)]
*  She goes, man, she earned her Monday. I said, what do you mean? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=728.0s)]
*  She goes, she did press for two weeks leading up to this. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=730.0s)]
*  She's been going theater to theater trying to help sell tickets. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=732.0s)]
*  And it's done. And it did well. She earned her Monday. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=734.0s)]
*  And I think it might be in Scientology. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=737.0s)]
*  Like it might be a thing in Scientology. But what Izzy earns his Monday. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=741.0s)]
*  After that fight, the way he celebrates life for like two weeks, he goes out. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=745.0s)]
*  He's in Miami. He's in New York. He's in Vegas. He's in LA. He's in London. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=750.0s)]
*  Like he does a tour. I said to him, I go, that's really inspirational. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=756.0s)]
*  Like the way that you look at life as it needs to be. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=760.0s)]
*  He goes, yeah, you've got to celebrate. You've got to celebrate these moments. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=763.0s)]
*  I think it's cool as fuck. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=767.0s)]
*  Where do you see the fucking bender I'm going on if my movie does well this weekend? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=769.0s)]
*  You want to talk about. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=773.0s)]
*  How could you ramp it up any more than you're already doing it? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=774.0s)]
*  Dude, I listen. I'll tell you what. I'm going to rehab. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=777.0s)]
*  I want someone to chloroform me at the premiere and I will wake up a week later. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=781.0s)]
*  They go, your movie did great, Bert. Your body's clean. You've been hydrated. You slept. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=785.0s)]
*  Just keep you on a constant IV. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=790.0s)]
*  Dude, I need to say this real quick. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=793.0s)]
*  And right now, everyone, please go to movie theaters this weekend to see my movie, The Machine. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=795.0s)]
*  Please go out of the house. Buy a ticket to a movie theater. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=800.0s)]
*  That is our biggest challenge is getting people in movie theaters. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=804.0s)]
*  So if you love me or you've ever loved me, you used to love me. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=806.0s)]
*  You think I'm annoying as fuck now. Whatever the fuck it is, just give me a shot. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=809.0s)]
*  Get out of the house and go see the story that started on this fucking podcast. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=814.0s)]
*  I would have never told on stage if this man right here didn't say you have to tell it on stage. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=820.0s)]
*  This is your fucking movie. You need to know him as The Machine. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=825.0s)]
*  For now on, call out his name at shows. Make him tell that story. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=829.0s)]
*  I leaked the trailer. This movie was going to sit on a fucking shelf. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=833.0s)]
*  Joe, you've done so much for me. Do it for Joe, guys. Do it for Joe. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=837.0s)]

*  Wow, I just think it's a funny fucking movie. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=844.0s)]
*  It's a good movie. It's action. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=846.0s)]
*  It's going to be fun. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=848.0s)]
*  It's a big action comedy that needs to be seen on the big screen. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=849.0s)]
*  And I think people will be surprised at how fun this movie is. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=852.0s)]
*  It's just fucking fun. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=857.0s)]
*  And I've been fucking up promotion for it because I'm way too honest. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=860.0s)]
*  I'm not an actor. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=865.0s)]
*  They're like, what are the kissing scenes like? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=866.0s)]
*  And I'm like, rough. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=869.0s)]
*  We have one kissing scene. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=878.0s)]
*  I didn't know there was kissing scenes in the movie because I don't read the action. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=882.0s)]
*  When I read the scripts, I just read the dialogue. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=886.0s)]
*  So I don't read like, you know, hey, Bert comes back, kisses his wife and knocks her off her feet. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=888.0s)]
*  I just go like, oh, Leanne was in Serbia and they're like, hey, you have a kissing scenes. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=895.0s)]

*  And they're like, yeah, your wife. And I was like, shut the fuck up. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=901.0s)]
*  I was like, is that cool? And Leanne's like, yes, you're an actor. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=903.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, but I mean, cheated on you ever. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=907.0s)]
*  Like I've been kissing someone 20 fucking years. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=910.0s)]
*  She was like, it's just acting. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=912.0s)]
*  I was like, OK. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=914.0s)]
*  All I'll say is the pants I was wearing were loose fitting and I don't wear underwear. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=917.0s)]
*  We did one take and I was like, costume change, please. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=925.0s)]
*  They're like, what? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=928.0s)]
*  I was like, I need to change my pants. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=929.0s)]
*  I guess I'm not an actor. I'm just a regular dude. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=931.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness, Bert. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=935.0s)]
*  They're like, huh? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=936.0s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know what the fuck you're supposed to do. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=939.0s)]
*  You're supposed to kiss someone and then just like how the fuck does that work? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=941.0s)]
*  You ever kiss someone? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=947.0s)]
*  Your body doesn't know that it's just acting. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=948.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=951.0s)]
*  How could it? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=954.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=955.0s)]

*  I'm a fucking bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, walk up. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=982.0s)]
*  Whom and as soon as and then she kissed back and I was like, what the fuck is happening? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=984.0s)]
*  This is different. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=988.0s)]

*  Is that are you allowed to talk about that? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=998.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1000.0s)]

*  You know, it was good. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1007.0s)]
*  I would say it's just acting. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1008.0s)]
*  It's just acting. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1009.0s)]

*  OK, which is true. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1012.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it is for some people, but it's also a fucking hardcore lie. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1013.0s)]
*  It's also why Brad Pitt fucked Angelina Jolie. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1017.0s)]
*  It's because you make out with her a couple of times. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1019.0s)]
*  You're like, that was fucking nice. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1021.0s)]
*  I wonder what it's like. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1022.0s)]
*  And then you're laying in bed going, hmm, hmm. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1023.0s)]
*  And Jennifer Aniston is texting you like pass, pass. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1025.0s)]
*  Like fucking Leanne, we did the kissing scene all day. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1027.0s)]

*  Kissed her. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1033.0s)]
*  Like got comfortable kissing her. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1034.0s)]
*  And then we got in bed in Serbia and Leanne's like, hey, you want to do that? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1036.0s)]
*  I was like, beat it, scissor lips. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1040.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm fucking. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1042.0s)]

*  Oh, rude. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1046.0s)]
*  My wife's got good sense of humor. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1048.0s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1049.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1050.0s)]
*  The whole fucking, I mean, the whole movie in general was like, I was not coming. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1051.0s)]
*  I ripped my fucking arm. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1055.0s)]
*  I blew my arm out. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1056.0s)]
*  But what is it like to have a story get turned into a movie? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1057.0s)]
*  That's got to be weird as fuck. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1060.0s)]
*  Like a story that like you kind of have to tell now. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1064.0s)]
*  Like if you do a show, if you do a show and you don't tell the machine story, people will get angry. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1068.0s)]
*  But they did it one last time I was here. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1074.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1076.0s)]
*  We were up here and they started chanting the machine. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1077.0s)]
*  And I was like, guys, I'm at the comedy mothership. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1079.0s)]
*  I'm just in an hour 15. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1081.0s)]
*  And that was the best. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1083.0s)]
*  That was one of the cool. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1084.0s)]
*  That's the coolest thing about that goddamn club is I see fucking Ron up in the top and I go, I'll tell. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1085.0s)]
*  I'll tell the machine if Ron comes down and tells Tater Salad and the place is like, Ron White's here. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1091.0s)]
*  And then Ron's like, fuck it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1096.0s)]
*  I'm coming down. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1098.0s)]
*  Ron White comes on stage, tells Tater Salad. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1100.0s)]
*  I go to tell the machine and realize I can't follow Tater Salad. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1102.0s)]
*  The best story ever told. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1106.0s)]
*  The best story ever told. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1107.0s)]
*  So it's surreal having your movie, your life turned into a movie. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1109.0s)]
*  It's surreal. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1112.0s)]
*  Like it is like it was emotional at times. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1113.0s)]
*  And then it's and then it's weird because you feel I feel very vulnerable, you know, like because some of the questions people ask, they're like they're not they like they take but they put teeth in it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1115.0s)]
*  They're like, so you rob people and you're like, Jesus Christ. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1125.0s)]
*  So you approve of the mafia does. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1129.0s)]

*  You're keeping your eyes open while we kiss. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1135.0s)]
*  Let's fucking just make it regular. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1137.0s)]
*  Good morning, America. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1139.0s)]
*  So they got upset with the premise. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1144.0s)]
*  They were just like they like they they read half of it and then they're like, so you're in the mafia. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1147.0s)]
*  And you're like, no, it's a little more complex. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1152.0s)]
*  No, but you like got welcomed into the mafia and you're like, yeah, like, kind of. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1154.0s)]
*  It's better when you hear the whole story. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1160.0s)]
*  I think I tell it a little different. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1162.0s)]
*  And they're like, and you robbed your friends. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1163.0s)]
*  Are they cool with you now? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1165.0s)]

*  Like I didn't expect certain people to be like fans of mine. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1191.0s)]
*  Like and I know that sounds like bad, but like you're always like when you look at your audiences, my audience kind of looks like the same one thing. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1196.0s)]
*  Guys that have chicks that are hotter than they deserve. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1205.0s)]

*  They're all a little overweight. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1208.0s)]
*  Like that's my fan base. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1209.0s)]
*  I like I literally go, hey, man, I can tell you the sponsors I can get for my tour. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1212.0s)]
*  Lipitor would be a good sponsor. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1215.0s)]
*  Some blood pressure medicine, some beard trimmers, not Lipitor. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1217.0s)]
*  I know we're talking about statins, but but like I know like I know my fan base and then you get like dudes who are like, I fucking love you. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1221.0s)]

*  That's when you appeal. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1258.0s)]
*  That's when you're the most appealing. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1259.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1261.0s)]
*  It does make sense. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1262.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it's hard to do. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1263.0s)]
*  It's hard to do publicly. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1266.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1267.0s)]
*  It's hard to be, you know, yourself publicly, especially when you're promoting a movie about yourself to be yourself publicly. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1268.0s)]

*  He's like, you want to just sit in front of 750 people and watch yourself? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1322.0s)]
*  I was like, I was like, hey, Mark, secret time. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1326.0s)]
*  I'm going to cry watching myself cry and I'm going to mouth my lines. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1330.0s)]
*  I did that when we did the first testing of the movie. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1335.0s)]
*  They sat me in the front row. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1338.0s)]
*  I had two bottles of wine. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1339.0s)]
*  I sat with Leanne. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1340.0s)]
*  I had a notebook. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1341.0s)]
*  I was supposed to write things in for notes. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1342.0s)]
*  The movie starts and I start bawling crying. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1344.0s)]
*  I start bawling crying and I start mouthing my lines. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1346.0s)]
*  I'm laughing hysterically. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1349.0s)]
*  I'm like, I loved I loved watching me more than a narcissist, whatever. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1351.0s)]
*  Like it was like the craziest thing. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1356.0s)]
*  So we go to the next screening and Kale, our producer, pulls me aside and he goes, I'm going to ask you to sit in the back. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1357.0s)]
*  I said, what? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1363.0s)]
*  He goes, it kind of affect the way people watch the movie. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1364.0s)]
*  So what do you mean? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1367.0s)]
*  He goes, I don't know if they're fucking crying like it's Cape Fear, but gay. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1368.0s)]
*  He goes, fucking sit in the back. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1372.0s)]
*  So I like somebody sat in the back, but I get emotional watching the movie because I feel like I feel like I'm watching a highlight reel. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1374.0s)]
*  Like I remember doing all these things and then they're all cool. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1380.0s)]
*  And so I was like, I don't know, I guess. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1383.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1385.0s)]
*  I think I watched the movie. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1386.0s)]
*  I guess I would. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1387.0s)]
*  But Mark's not going to watch it. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1389.0s)]
*  Secret time. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1390.0s)]
*  Well, that's not very secret. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1392.0s)]
*  And I get both perspectives. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1394.0s)]
*  Like you made it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1396.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1397.0s)]
*  It seems weird that he would like he's trying to like enforce that on you. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1398.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1403.0s)]
*  He was just like he was like, you're cool with that? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1404.0s)]
*  Like I've heard a few people like like like there are people like. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1406.0s)]
*  Like there are people like do you listen to your own podcast? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1409.0s)]
*  No. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1411.0s)]
*  OK, I can throw on. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1412.0s)]
*  But I might if it's like if like it's a Huberman podcast or one of those ones where I'm going to try to implement whatever they're talking about. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1413.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1421.0s)]
*  So maybe with those I would listen to it again just to try to remember. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1422.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1426.0s)]
*  And write shit down, you know, because he gives you so many different like beneficial things. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1427.0s)]
*  It's like you have to kind of go back and write him down and try to keep track of him. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1433.0s)]
*  Like there's certain people who can listen to their own. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1438.0s)]
*  Like I can throw on an old two bears from during the pandemic and I will. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1441.0s)]
*  It can. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1444.0s)]

*  guess it when you look I'm not an expert but the words in like in the Slavic [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1717.2s)]
*  language whatever they speak in Serbia to explain me the words they use are [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1723.16s)]
*  like unpredictable explosive like I think those are the words that you would [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1727.76s)]
*  use that personality and they're also like like like there was a scene in the [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1733.8400000000001s)]

*  to say but I think our language is more slangy so we get things a little easier [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1757.6399999999999s)]
*  I know when I was in Russia they didn't have a lot of slangs like that wasn't [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1761.72s)]
*  in a communist government you want to make sure your words mean what you say [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1766.24s)]
*  right so they don't like that's why that's funny when I said I was the [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1769.24s)]

*  because they don't slangs aren't their thing so she didn't want to do the scene [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1786.96s)]
*  with me oh isn't yeah isn't that it doesn't that mean car in Russian yeah [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=1790.68s)]

*  yes all right that was World War two no fucking no my favorite ceasefire is [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3442.68s)]
*  during World War one they had a ceasefire with was it the Russians and [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3448.2s)]
*  who was it was it was the I think it was the Russians and the Germans they had a [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3454.32s)]
*  ceasefire and it was because of wolves so many people I've heard you talk about [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3459.32s)]
*  this yeah who what were the two groups I always fucked this up I know one group [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3464.2400000000002s)]
*  was the Russians Russians and Germans right so they had a ceasefire because so [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3468.6400000000003s)]
*  many of their soldiers are getting killed by wolves that's and that's so [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3477.0s)]
*  funny I tried to joke last night about what's wrong with Germans is they don't [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3481.96s)]
*  have any predators they did back then they did at least when they tried going [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3486.28s)]
*  into Russia but could you imagine you have an enemy that's invading you and [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3492.96s)]
*  you agree we need to bond together and kill this other enemy that is not human [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3496.4s)]
*  I think that's a plot of then we go back to killing each other it's a plot of [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3502.48s)]
*  predator this is such a crazy story parties of Russians and German scouts [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3506.88s)]
*  met recently and were hotly engaged in a skirmish when a large pack of wolves [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3515.28s)]
*  dashed on the scene and attacked the wounded have you ever seen the video of [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3519.12s)]
*  the cop going to give a parking ticket and the fucking 50 wolves run down the [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3522.84s)]
*  street I don't think that's real oh yeah I don't think that's real do you know [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3526.6800000000003s)]
*  Jamie he gets in their car and the wolves run by them Jamie will find out [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3532.88s)]
*  if it's real I think someone told me that was CGI I don't want to change all [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3539.6000000000004s)]
*  of our stuff but I don't know if it is CGI though I really want to find out a [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3547.1200000000003s)]
*  UFO thing from last week did you see that oh the Jeremy Corbell thing and [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3550.2400000000002s)]
*  then see Jeremy Corbell posted but I saw a post of like five videos I'll show on [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3553.76s)]
*  this fucking object in the sky yeah this is over a military base yeah yeah [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3557.28s)]
*  apparently like 50 people film this thing so this is this is the yeah this [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3562.16s)]
*  is the Russian one so watch the cops over here he's talking and these wolves [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3566.36s)]
*  are running by I don't know if that's real man looks pretty real it looks very [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3572.12s)]
*  real the only way so what shadows shadows are perfect yeah but they maybe [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3576.64s)]
*  yeah wow if they do a time-lapse so yeah there's just two videos they put over [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3581.4s)]
*  each other like those wolves did run down that street oh wait wait I see what [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3585.7599999999998s)]
*  you're saying so go back to him getting in the car are there no the wolves are [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3589.96s)]
*  there oh he's reacting to them yeah but that could be an actor they're not [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3593.44s)]
*  reacting to the cars is what I'm saying right but the wolves are just running [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3601.08s)]
*  right if they're not used to being around cars but the cars are reacting to [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3605.04s)]
*  them that car pulls over to the to the left to avoid the wolf yeah I think [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3609.44s)]
*  that's real man watch how the car reacts here's the other thing I'm looking at [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3613.76s)]
*  that's the last they'll be hard to fake is the headlights from this car should [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3617.68s)]
*  be giving an extra shadow on these wolves coming this way and it looks like [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3622.3199999999997s)]
*  it's only from the streetlight there's no shadow coming this way interesting [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3625.7599999999998s)]
*  which means that those cars weren't there when the wolves are there maybe [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3632.56s)]
*  sort of depending on where the beams it would be an interesting I mean it would be [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=3635.8799999999997s)]

*  find what he does on stage in society you know that's the way Joey operates and I think that's why he loves Jersey he goes in sees his guy this deli guy and and they chop it up for like 20 minutes and then Joey did like a type 5 right okay that personality is authentically in New York New York Jersey personality right but what Joey can do on stage is so unique and when he gets rolling it's so unique that I feel like [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=4699.26s)]
*  No matter what else he does at this stage of his life like it's so hard to get to be that funny yeah why would you stop doing that his new book tremendous is out and stop doing that he's too good he's too good he's too fun too fun to be around dude he would be he was fun what is in town just hanging out in the green room the part I miss about Joey the most is when just hanging with him yeah and he's [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=4730.1s)]
*  when he wasn't trying to be funny and he was fucking hilarious yeah the heart one of the hardest he's ever made me laugh is we're sitting there I made him say it again on a podcast that made me laugh so hard we're sitting at Marie I see we're having having I was doing a cleanse where I was having green tea and he was having coffee and he was smoking cigarettes back then he was smoking them on the DL no one knew don't tell nobody and I go Joey what was prison like and he just very casually goes dog [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=4758.98s)]

*  but it's like I don't know that's interesting it's like do you feel like you have to yeah I feel like I'm not good enough no is why I'm I love Tommy so much and why I look up to him in so many ways is that Tommy knows he's good enough Tommy knows his worth what's the difference between you and Tommy why do you think that he knows his worth and you don't seem to know your worth even though there's so much [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=4968.98s)]
*  evidence there's someone that's so much evidence that you're loved yeah so what how would that not be enough I don't think I think about it that way or is that not it no no no no I think I think I think it's are we had very different dads mm-hmm and I think Tom for whatever reason I think we're both really close with our dads we were both we're both really he was really close with his dad I think his dad just raised him a different way [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=4998.98s)]
*  and I think my dad raised me a different way and I think whatever my dad did it left me with a little bit of a hole and it no slight to my dad but it left me with a little bit of a hole that turned me into a performer to make one to make sure like like my dad would be like if like the Iraq War started and I said I said this is fucking stupid my dad goes go to your fucking room you're fucking idiot you don't know what you're talking about he's looking stay up there until you figure out what's wrong with you and then I'm sitting up there going like I gotta get out of my room I'm 16 at the time [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5028.98s)]
*  my room how am I fucking idiot why am I fucking idiot I don't and then I was like okay I was forced to sit with it and I was like I don't know anything about why we're going to war with Iraq I don't know anything I don't know anything about war I know I've never been to war my dad okay I'm gonna go down I talked to my dad about it my dad's like this is why you're an idiot tell me why you think I don't know anything about this war he's got son was saying is gassing his own people because they're a different religion a different ethnicity and he goes and so we came to protect half of that fucking country here's the other thing that's cool this is the [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5058.98s)]
*  first war we're getting to watch start on TV we're watching a war start like a fucking Super Bowl so sit down with me and let's watch the fucking war and I was like wait we're watching a war he was like yeah it's on CNN watch this and you remember that you remember the fucking Iraq War with like the first when we were kids you were probably like 18 and then they just like B2B and you watch a fucking Tomahawk missile head in and you're watching people walk into the fucking Capitol [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5088.98s)]
*  in night vision and I'm like oh this is fucking crazy yeah that was my dad and I and I don't I can't speak for Tommy but I know Tommy was really close with his dad and I think his dad for lack of better words I hope this comes off respectful to my dad was a little bit more of a man his doubt no no no no my dad ran track my dad's a man trust me my dad's a man but Tom's dad fought in Vietnam Tom Tom's dad did a fucking couple tours Tom's dad was a champion powerlifter [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5118.98s)]
*  like I think we had different dads my dad ran track he didn't go to the works he had allergies you know like like he would they wouldn't let him in the Vietnam War and so like a man was yeah he didn't pass physical yeah he had allergies Jesus and like they're like we can't send you in there and all of a sudden you shut down because you have hay fever oh right like then you're just like in the middle of a fucking do that wars the scariest war to me because it's the most the most yeah because it's the most nonsensical it [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5148.98s)]
*  was started off of a false flag no one felt strongly about going over there no no one felt strongly about the cause it seemed insane to everybody it went on for years I remember when it ended because I was a kid really yeah I was living in San Francisco and I remember thinking naively that this is great because now there's never gonna be war again I really remember that thought I guess I was like 10 or something like that 10 or 11 it was just weird it was it was a weird thing [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5178.98s)]
*  to just imagine that they forced people and to go fight in some war that nobody understood and that might have been connected to heroin might have been connected to heroin have you been to Vietnam no I have not people love it over there Bourdain is like it was his favorite place it'll change your cultural DNA like the way you see the world's never the same I'd say the same about Japan though Japan's pretty fucking dope pretty dope is it's [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5208.98s)]
*  Japan's like Japan's like it's it shouldn't be legal like you should just weird shit like robot fuck shows and and then all of a sudden you go to the subway and no one's speaking they're all holding hands I passed out on a Japanese dude in the subway I was drunk I passed out on this poor guy and he didn't do anything he just let me sleep on him I woke up he was just like hi yeah they have a very respectful culture in terms of like the way people walked on the street yeah people give people [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5238.98s)]
*  plenty of space they seem to navigate it much more easily but then like you see in some cultures they just kind of there's so many people that just kind of bump into each other like apparently in China that's a thing oh and Vietnam it's I made the analogy in in Japan it's like no one touches each other in Vietnam they got their fingers in your mouth oh no not really but like figuratively like it's really aggressive I drove a motorcycle through traffic in Vietnam and it was [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5268.98s)]
*  thrilling and terrifying really it well yeah you're because it's almost like New York but New York on fucking steroids because you got like you don't pay attention who's behind you just pay attention who's in front of you and you're almost racing everyone it was fucking crazy I drove old Russian Ural through the streets of Vietnam same motorcycle I had one I think the same motorcycle we have out of the farmstead when you called me yeah right that was fucking what a great call what a great fucking call I'm gonna write a book I'm gonna write a book [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5298.98s)]
*  out of out of like top ten things Joe Rogan said to me but every now and then I get one like look at this this is Vietnam I know I've seen this this is insanity imagine being a motorcycle with a kid on your back a kid trying to do they got their whole family on the back of that thing so look at there's everyone's got two people some people have three or four people yeah look there's three people right there that's four people so insane we don't you think people just kind of get used to that though [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5328.98s)]
*  like I think people get accustomed to almost anything like we're accustomed to driving cars now that shit has only been around for a hundred years it's so weird so weird driving around in a fucking car everywhere it's only been around for a short amount of time and we're just so accustomed to it it's it's just normal when you think about when you think about like taking horses across the country right have you ever have you ridden a horse lately no fuck horses you know gangster those people not fuck horses [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5358.98s)]
*  let me be quick fuck I should have I want to rephrase I say bad things sometimes I don't mean to fuck me riding a horse oh I thought you meant fuck horses fuck horses like fuck horses I'm not getting on horses not fuck them I think they're beautiful amazing creatures you know what I'm really kind of sad about honestly what that there's a lot of wild horses in this country and they're they're trying to figure out what to do with them and they might wind up killing them no yeah they might want I mean I think [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5388.98s)]
*  there's there's people that are proposing like getting rid of a certain amount of them I don't know what they do with them now like what like how do they handle wild horses now but there was this argument like that they just can't let them get to a point where they oh like where there's no predators for wild horses and they just start overwhelming the population in some of these areas and like there's cattle that graze in these areas and the horse and the cattle compete for food and [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5418.98s)]
*  what are they but there's a lot of wild horses I was I was just like it's kind of a sad animal to be wild it's like wild dogs no it's beautiful I was in Crow territory up in either South Dakota or Montana and we were driving motorcycles for travel channel and we took a helicopter [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5448.98s)]
*  we hunted a buffalo with the with the Crow Nation shot the buffalo processed it then they take us back and they put us on our motorcycles and like hey we're gonna meet up at the bottom everyone's gonna have a drink and I'm on my motorcycle I did not have a drink in me and I in the sun setting we're driving through the hills like the you know the the fucking hills and as I'm listening to Wilco in my headsets in my with my helmet on on a fucking Indian judge I think it was a judge whatever the fucking judge was a fucking pack of wild horses starts [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5468.1s)]
*  running next to me and I'm like and no one's around no cameras no film just me Wilco and fucking seven horses at a full fucking sprint keeping up with me on the motorcycle the sun setting and I'm just thinking motherfucker no one's gonna believe this no one's gonna ever see this it's just your moment you have in life wild horses are fucking beautiful beautiful no I should rephrase what I'm saying I don't think here's here's my thought [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5498.1s)]
*  on it like what I don't want them to be killed like other animal I don't want to be it's weird I don't want people to hunt wild horses oh no like so you can't the best way to control populations is either you send someone out to kill them or you let people hunt them and for all the other animals like the deer species and elk and stuff they let people hunt them and that's how they keep populations in check but with this one it's like you can't I don't you know like who wants to go [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5528.1s)]
*  out and shoot dogs nobody no but no yeah no I guess they probably do with wild wild dogs are a problem yeah it's so much so I think an elderly man got killed recently by wild dogs in like Georgia or something oh dude that down which is really scary down south you can still get attacked by dogs yeah I went for a jog in Alabama my wife's family lives I went for a jog in Alabama Georgia Alabama and a dog chased me like you just forget people don't have fences everywhere there [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5558.1s)]
*  dog heard me jogging on the street from their porch and started running at me and I thought at some point it'll stop right I jumped up onto a Baptist church you know like they have like the foundation with the cross in the name praise Jesus I jumped up and I had to standing up there as this dog just stood there and barked at me and I sat I was I'm in running shorts headsets and I'm just sitting there waiting for the dog to get done and it we sat there for 30 fucking minutes the dog like sat for a second and then I'm like oh my god like is anyone gonna [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5588.1s)]
*  fucking help me Jesus and you sit there I think people forget just how fragile we are as animals because like we are versus other animals some people are just dopey and irresponsible and just let their dog run around that's a that's a common thing too but the thing about this wild dogs is like once you've got a population of wild dogs breeding in the woods you basically got something that it's kind of like a wolf very much it's kind of like as a small shitty look at this oh my god fuck off [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5618.1s)]
*  he fought for his life against three large dogs oh my god this guy got torn apart [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5648.1s)]
*  two pit bulls and a German Shepherd Jesus fucking Christ and they were all on the same team he said he kept it they kept attacking me for like 15 minutes roll that down [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5653.46s)]
*  it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it was actually it oh my god three dogs two of them were pit bulls the third one was a German Shepherd one with a German Shepherd one of them attacked me when it did it triggered the other two and they joined [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5661.620000000001s)]
*  in they were attacking me from all sides I was trying to keep them away from the inside of my legs where the femoral arteries are and away from my neck I had nothing with me to fend them off I was desperately grabbing sticks to hit them but the sticks were decayed and kept falling apart they kept attacking me for what seemed like 15 minutes I was physically and mentally exhausted I was trying to figure out what to do I considered falling on the ground or rolling up in a ball and playing dead like you're supposed to do with bears I considered screaming for help [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5678.06s)]
*  but I knew no one would hear me my four wheeler and my cell phone were 150 yards away and I knew I would never make it there I finally remembered that there's a tree stand nearby the adjoining property I found a good stick and I was able to keep the dogs at a distance until I could get to that stand and climb up on it in the stand Scott was able to catch his breath get his heart rate down I keep the first good look at his wounds he was in bad shape he had punctures and lacerations of both arms and both hands and from his waist down to his ankle [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5707.54s)]
*  he needs medical attention immediately I sat in the stand for about 30 minutes after the dogs left he said when I got down they heard the rustling of the leaves under my boots they came running back in so Scott rushed back into the tree stand and waited another 30 minutes after the dogs left this time he purposely made a lot of noise to see if the dogs would return they did not he decided to head in the opposite direction away from his four wheeler and where the dogs had come from I found a good stick and I quietly tiptoed [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5737.54s)]
*  to a fence line that was about 60 yards away I climbed over the fence and then hiked about a half a mile through a cow pasture out to the highway I stood I didn't know the story was gonna be so long I feel like I'm so fucking this guy got fucked up by dogs the end so he [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5767.54s)]
*  298 puncture wounds and lacerations a lot of stitches to fix them up so I guess he got out a couple guys alone in a pickup truck drove around me yeah okay there it is so he got help no rabies that's what okay let's go let's work this into this bit this is why Germans are weak because Germans don't have predators right this is I was trying to say if you grew up with predators right predators like I think like I grew up getting attacked by dogs like that in Florida you think that helped you no you can get me [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5787.36s)]
*  it does when you're a kid when I was a kid like if you saw a dog on the street it could always be touch and go like you never know you always moved away from a dog that you just saw one how are your daughters around a strange dog they know yeah they're like yeah because I've seen bad dogs good dogs they've seen dogs and some dogs you know you just can't trust them you don't know them no you know you've really you have no idea what's going on with that dog and most dogs are great you know big fan of dogs but those dogs until they're not it's [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5817.36s)]
*  and people that get like really violent dogs dogs are like hey you know you got a trainer you got a trainer you got you got like a wild monster that lives with you now do you ever get you ever about to say something and then someone talks over you and you go that was a good call man I was about to say the most horrible thing and I was like I was like we cut you back the yeah man in Florida we had gators we had lightning we had [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5847.36s)]
*  sharks we had a lot of poisonous snakes poison the spiders we have molesters that was really big when I was a kid they killed that kid Adam Walsh Adam Walsh in Miami right so that was the that was my tornadoes hurricanes like we had a lot of things that could kill you I remember we were in Hawaii I was with we were doing a hike with this Hawaiian dude and I was terrified like the Isla has a fear of bees she has a fear of like spiders and stuff and [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5877.36s)]
*  she was talking to him about snakes and then and the guy said oh we don't snakes in Hawaii and then then we go we get down the hike we end up at like a restaurant or whatever having a drink wherever we went to with the guy and he's very low-key and I said something about like you know this is island living and she and she said to me and it was an insight of it you know the from a babes mouth to whatever she goes uh dad they don't have snakes that's all you need to know about this guy like what you mean she goes that's why he's so chill he's never had to deal with snakes I go what you [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5907.36s)]
*  because every time I go in the yard I'm looking for snakes like anytime I walk outside I'm looking for snakes like that's the way when rattlesnakes are a thing in your community like you grew where where you lived back in LA that was rattlesnake central oh for sure you never walked into your backyard not thinking there might be a rattlesnake right my dogs got bit multiple times and and when that's your reality it changes the way you look at life fucking Australians got everything that could kill them yeah everything everything I mean they got those saltwater [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5937.36s)]
*  crocs dude you can't you know you can't go on the beach at night in northern Australia you can't go on the beach at night because crocs are just laying on the beach and you'll think it's a log and sit on them oh my Jesus they told us that when we went we went to do the great bear reef they're like do not go on the beach at night do you know what a horrific death that would be if you're a little tipsy and you sit down on what you think is a log I didn't show you this video yesterday no what do you have for me it was we went around yesterday as a [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5967.36s)]
*  like what happened in Florida 23 year old dude went out for a piss in the back behind a bar and a row area he had lost his arm it's all not the attack isn't on video but him thrashing in the water afterwards is and then they pull them out and the arm missing and the full [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=5997.36s)]
*  and the tourniquet on with a guy with a cigarette hanging out over him that's where I fucking grew up don't show me that anyone that ever says like hey Bert why would you ever fuck around with Xanax I grew up like that we were on a lake on a lake living in the lake we was swimming the lake knowing at any moment a gator could take you away from your family and take him back to his nest and sit with you in his mouth for fucking four days until your body rotted and then they do the death roll on the bottom I mean dude and then you think about like you think about [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6016.88s)]
*  like that so that creates a person right Australia that creates a person those are realities in their life that creates that person right all those well trauma it's not trauma but like they're kind of similar in a way what's that oh oh yeah but then you'll get Germans they got nothing they got nothing but I was thinking that Australians I mean Australians in Florida people there's a lot in common fucking cousins yeah maybe that's what it is maybe it's like a certain breed of people that has to deal with [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6046.88s)]
*  dangerous environments like Australians have to deal with sharks saltwater crocs as jellyfish they have night of fish can kill them box the box jellyfish kill people people swim in pajamas cheese they swim in blue pajamas I'm not fucking around you swim in blue we went to the Great Barrier Reef look at jocks box jellyfish season get on blue pajamas and so we put on blue pajamas snorkeling your whole body's covered you have gel on your face your every part of you is covered [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6076.88s)]
*  oh my god dude fuck that and I was like why would I snort because I go to Florida I do that why would you do that get the fuck out of that water it is a great barrier reef get the fuck out of that water it's pretty it's pretty cool I'm sure it's cool but like at what point in time do you not want to get killed by a jellyfish most of the time right so how do you avoid getting killed by a jellyfish don't swim in the fucking jellyfish are Jesus they've got nine of the ten how many like how many deadly snakes does Australia have because I think they got nine of the ten deadliest snakes [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6106.88s)]
*  we went canyoning canyon canyoning I think it's called where you just you like repel and climb up rocks but you're going down a canyon through waterfalls and stuff and the guy was like keep away like anytime you saw debris on the side keep away from it you know we got the the two-step spider or whatever the spiders there are fucking next level oh there's spiders what's it called two steps I made it up I don't know what the fuck it's called that's a good day for a spider two steps because you get bit we get bit you get two steps and then you fall [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6136.88s)]
*  that but that's that creates a person I think about Kelly Slater a lot and like because I love the podcast you do with them you talked about sharks mm-hmm the brain that can just shut that off do you see the bull shark attacked the kayak recently yeah why it was that a bull shark yeah I thought the no no I'm sorry the tiger shark tiger shark was the one that bit the tail off the other bull shark you see that one oh I didn't see that one but let's show the kayak one first the tiger shark this is in Hawaii and I [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6166.88s)]
*  think that's that's a high percentage of people that get bit in Hawaii get bit by these fuckers look at that thing bro that is so wild yeah I said again that is so crazy I mean dude that thing just was his feet was his feet in the water [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6196.88s)]
*  his feet no his feet are in the water right now look watch where his left foot comes from watch his foot's behind the shark right now he almost got [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6217.56s)]
*  his leg bit off oh my god oh my god look at this that's his oh my god do that shark almost bit his femoral artery look how insane that is look at that thing just imagine the feeling of that thing chomping on your kayak and what if it flips it you could easily [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6226.8s)]
*  flip it oh you're fucked I mean it's just kind of luck that it didn't flip it look at that that's insanity that's a fucking big tiger shark too oh my god that's so scary that's the guy yeah fuck dude that guy's gotta be so happy he's alive [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6245.9s)]
*  it's gotta be accelerated I'd be like fuck you it's weird like it people who change their opinion on sharks it used to be that everybody hated sharks after Jaws [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6261.62s)]
*  it'd be like fuck yeah let's go shark fishing oh you're a fucking manly shark fisherman and now it's like leave the sharks alone like people they need to protect sharks now but it's it's I understand absolutely they're right you need to protect sharks but it's just a weird like shift there's like a dangerous predator that eats human beings on a regular basis we're like we gotta make sure there's more of those it's weird I'm not I understand it I agree with it but I'm saying it is weird they're like [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6275.86s)]
*  there was no sharks no people would get eaten by sharks it's called Lake or let me lakes in Florida you get eaten by a gator like Michigan lakes you ever seen people in Michigan they were swimming or Wisconsin it's got all Minnesota got all the fucking lakes right and they just swimming lakes and just swim out and don't worry about shit my wife's like that my wife we have a big lake house in Alabama and she'll swim out to the middle of fucking lake you know that's a really good benefit to really cold climates no reptiles because when you [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6305.82s)]
*  got an abundance of dangerous reptiles in terrain where they can hide you got a real problem kids I think it well we go back to the thing I think it raises a different person oh for sure I think it creates a person who maybe anticipates the danger anticipates the like do you ever do you ever anticipate then the the the tragedy in life like think cuz I know you're kind of guy that I remember you [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6335.74s)]
*  know I was saying one time anytime I see the guy with the tie on I go he doesn't even know what I could do to that tie I was always joking around I know but but I always felt like if I had a tie on someone could grab my tie and collar choke me yeah so I was like why would you like give someone a handle to put around your neck but I wonder if I wonder if when you grow up with these dangerous I was a little obsessed with jiu-jitsu back then though fucking Isla is obsessed with jiu-jitsu it's really fun man I wish everybody get obsessed with it shout out to Eddie Bravo shout out to everybody shout out to Eddie Bravo shout out to Jean Jacques Machado [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6365.74s)]
*  shout out to all the fucking people teaching that because it's I think it's one of the most beneficial things that anyone could ever do for their their health for their brain the peace of mind but once you learning something that's actually effective you started fighting early right well I started martial arts when I was 15 that's why I really got into it I took it a little when I was 14 but it was hard to get to the place I started out this karate place in Newton and then I started in taekwondo when I was 15 [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6395.74s)]
*  well you what was uh what was your you don't have to obviously whatever but you talked about [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6425.74s)]
*  I don't know how you start a question with you don't have to obviously whatever I know but I don't know sometimes I don't know you know I love you but sometimes I don't know if you told me this in secret and I'm just telling it I'm asking you a question that you told me as a secret okay go ahead tell me what was you got bullied that's why you got into martial arts because you got bullied right? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6432.139999999999s)]
*  well yeah for sure I mean I was always small and I was always new or I moved into these places what did you weigh it like when you got into martial arts what what did you weigh? well I wrestled at 134 when I was 15 or I was 14 15 I was 15 that's like two Tony Hitchcliffs so yeah one and I don't believe I cut weight for that but I did cut weight when I started fighting when I was 16 and 17 I was cutting down to 140. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6449.74s)]
*  and I was weighing 140 for a while but it was a real struggle and I only did the states at 140 once and that was when I was 17. so what was your like because I was bullied I was an all boys Catholic high school but it definitely formed a little bit of me that maybe I didn't wish it did. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6479.74s)]
*  yeah it's your bullying like can you tell me a bullying story? it wasn't horrible you know it was just a bunch of dudes being dicks and I didn't like the feeling of not being able to defend myself. like was it physical? oh yeah one dude was one dude grabbed me in a headlock this is why I started wrestling one dude grabbed me in a headlock just like out of nowhere we were just staring at each other we didn't even exchange words and he threw me to the ground and he raised his fist and he said [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6494.74s)]
*  he was going to punch me and then he decided not to and he just let me go like it was so easy to do that to me that he didn't have to just beat me up. catch and release. catch and release. catch and release. and first of all thank that dude for doing that but first of all I don't know why he grabbed me I didn't touch him but at least he didn't really hurt me but it made me realize like oh I don't know what to do if somebody grabs me and tries to wrestle me. so I started taking wrestling I joined the wrestling [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6524.74s)]
*  team and I started doing taekwondo at the exact same time so I was doing both of them at the exact same time and I couldn't do two of them and I had to pick one or the other and I really enjoyed kicking people it was exciting it was there's something about that it was just so it was such a crick and that's when I loved movies like Chuck Norris movies and you know Sean Claude Van Damme movies it's like wild kicks is what you want to see people do you want your Bruce Lee movie you want to watch [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6554.74s)]
*  I want to be able to do that yeah and so that was what I got obsessed with that seemed to me to be something fun to do. so what do you think it says like I'm not to get back to the what makes you the man you are and what makes me the man I am where I go I want everyone to be pleased when I got bullied and my bullying was pretty physical because it was all boys Catholic high school and everyone's like boys will be boys yeah and got beat up a couple times like just beat up [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6584.74s)]
*  my defense was I don't know if it was because maybe I was a little bit bigger and I was the size of the people you know like I got bullied by dudes were bigger than me but I was also not like I was I was a hundred probably 180 pounds right and so like even still but I was just a softer dude you know and so I wonder if the my bullying regressed my aggression I think and it turned me in to more of a smart ass more of a like [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6614.74s)]
*  I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna outwit you I've always had I've always had a respect I've always had a big respect for dudes who can fight and not fucking with the dudes who can fight like I've obviously I said I'd fight Israel you know and I said I think I might have said accidentally and I'd like to apologize for this publicly might have said Tom and I are gonna jump Nate Diaz I might have said I might have said I was I didn't care if Conor McGregor slapped me meeting Conor meeting Izzy I know that that's wild talk [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6644.74s)]
*  I'm a comedian everyone should know I'm a comedian but that energy is where my sense of humor leaned when I got bullied I just was like well I'm gonna I'm gonna challenge you I'm gonna challenge you in comedy and if you don't get it then you're the fucking idiot but if you get it then does that make sense nope okay I remember I remember I got beat up I got beat up pretty good yeah a couple times a couple [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6674.74s)]
*  times I got beat up pretty good both were off of jokes and what's interesting about both those times both those men and I doubt they're listening I guarantee you they're listening and they may know who they are but both those men's got publicly shamed and kind of shunned by our friend groups they're like you don't get jokes both those guys didn't get the comedy and and they lost a lot of friends and they lost a lot of like because it was like they were jokes right but I will tell you those two men taught me a very valuable lesson [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6704.74s)]
*  there are men to fuck with and there are men not to fuck with yeah some dudes don't want you to play games with them they don't and and and it's and it's a real challenge of like like you're the baddest motherfucker I know per well one of the baddest motherfuckers I know personally I make fun of you a lot and I've never won and I've said wild things about you I said I called you gay on fucking Logan Paul's podcast hey I want I would love to hear more about this Jamie I got that thing is happening to the headphone again I don't hear myself anymore [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6734.74s)]

*  Serbia before the first day of shooting I had some wine at dinner and I was laying in bed and I listened to you on a podcast and you said here's the problem with comedies they don't go fucking hard anymore and I sat up in bed and went my first scene isn't hard [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6841.38s)]
*  my first scene isn't hard it's soft and it's stupid and he's right and I fucking rewrote it I woke up my cousin I rewrote it I said what do you think you think it's better and he goes it's I don't know if they're gonna let you do it and I said I know but I just I'm listening to Joe and and like if you're if you're a little bit of a lighthouse for us comics is where you know you've always given me great advice and I'm hearing you say it third hand do a podcast we rewrote it I went in I gave it to Peter Tencio I said this I want this is can we shoot this also shoot this one also [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6854.06s)]

*  beautiful and so we fucking come out hard that's great it also sounds like a group of people get you yeah sometimes you know when a guy it's his first big movie you know they'll tell you what to do and give you advice that might not necessarily work with your personality [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6892.06s)]
*  well people want to be safe and they want and they don't want to get fired man everyone's got a BMW and they got to pay the payment bro imagine being the lady that decided to do that Bud Light campaign with Dylan Mulvaney [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6909.82s)]
*  imagine like never thinking that a mistake that you make in a company could could go that bad and so people when they see something like that in the news they get so fucking scared of being the person that gets involved in another thing like that for the left or for the right it's like it's companies that are learning that attaching yourself to these like socio-political things like there's consequences people get mad oh they get really mad [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6923.34s)]
*  the day that commercial came out I'm in fucking yeah police the day that commercial comes out I'm in some fucking arena I only say arena so that you know so that we know the conversation that you don't try out a lot of new material in arenas you know an arenas show is pretty fucking dialed in yeah pretty dialed in so I bring out a Bud Light I've been drinking on stage lately I bring out a Bud Light and this dude booze he goes boo and I'm like what and he's like don't drink that shit that's trans shit [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=6953.1s)]

*  him she's like are we gonna do this or what he's like no no no we're doing it and he kills the Bud Light and then he gets in the bed and he sucks his girlfriend's cock that's the fucking trans commercial I want to see I like that yeah that's [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7013.1s)]
*  representative all you see is his head going up and down and she's like and then her voice lowers like yeah play with the balls play with the balls oh and then he fucking swallows and he follows it with another but it's not chaser make that that's inclusive [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7026.740000000001s)]
*  mmm it is it's better yeah yeah just go hard just go so far the other door I wonder how much further it do people forgive because if these people look the right wingers right wingers generally tend to be Christian do you think they forgive [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7041.02s)]
*  Bud Light is there forgiveness in that or is there no forgiveness in a large corporation that attaches so is it a lesson like for the other corporations if you want to attach yourself to like [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7058.780000000001s)]
*  polarizing viewpoints and things that are hot-button social topics there's consequences I don't know I hope it's not like why are corporations getting involved in social stuff anyway there's only one reason because they think that it's [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7070.26s)]
*  gonna benefit their bottom line up until now no it's the same now it's different now they're doing things they're getting involved in social issues because they think they have to and they have the cut the company has to be [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7085.02s)]
*  representative and they have to they have to go out there and get involved in these your silence is definite that's the thing oh yeah when the black squares came out do you remember the black squares force they forced you into compliance and anytime someone's asking you forcing you into compliance that is not never good it's never good because they can do it with that then it keeps moving further and further down the line and then you've got some weird new quasi freedom well you know what it is here's the slippery slope though so [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7096.94s)]

*  you know it's a woman's right to choose or whether it's pro-choice or whether it's you know do you support black lives matter do you did the real problem becomes in when people enforce compliance and they want you to comply whether it's like they're doing it socially whether they're threatening your livelihood like you can force people to think a certain way if it if their livelihood depends on it and we know that that happens [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7306.06s)]

*  in a way like if you were like using it in a sentence like talk about a Richard Pryor routine if you're it just it didn't seem as offensive then as it does now now it seems like impossibly offensive yeah that's what's what's interesting is that there's no words that are really that way where it's positive if certain people use it and negative if other people use it like you could say it as like an affirmation [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7456.06s)]
*  you could say it is like a punchline sometimes sometimes so many stand-ups Derek Poston shout out to him I think it was 25 and he did ten minutes if you're a stand-up I mean it is it is a very valuable word but we know it's crazy is I watched Derek last night fucking hilarious and he uses the word a lot and I started counting a couple times I was like I was like this is just seeing you you know just seeing you and you have a [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7486.06s)]
*  I won't not spoiler alert but yeah great fucking thing and I watched Eric and I watched I kind of counted and I thought what's amazing is they are not even hearing the word really they're not hearing the word as if I said that they'd hear it there right it's just skating by right when he says it it's it doesn't cause any tension it's amazing it's amazing but that's what's so weird about that word is that it's the only word where the amount of melanin in your skin predicates whether or not you could that dictates whether or not you can say it [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7516.06s)]
*  where you're from that dictates where you can say it it's like it's a word that is privileged to a certain group I mean not privilege obviously it's a terrible slur pointed at people yeah but when they're using it the way they want to use it whether it's in hip-hop lyrics or whether it's a stand-up comedy when they're using it the way they want to use it it's a beautiful like social tool it's melodic oh my god for stand-up comedy it I think it gives an extra layer of flavor [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7546.06s)]
*  like if like Chappelle uses it Chappelle's got a joke about and it where the I won't even fucking run but about him and his dude in the car and a cop pulls up next to him and his dude and it's a white guy and he's like I think we should race him and Chappelle goes and he uses the word but the word is the thing and it gives it such a like where you're like it just sparkles well Chris Rock is one of the greatest bits ever on that word I mean it's a fucking amazing bit [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7576.06s)]
*  it's just it's just a very very strange word in terms of like all the other words exist that's the the only one like there's no positive like slurs against Jews right there's no there's no like there's no slurs against Jews that if someone was Jewish they could say in a positive way well hang [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7606.06s)]
*  right but the flip is the Jewish people I'm getting comfortable Jewish people will mock their Jewish Judaism in front of you yes like well I can't yeah I can't throw a baseball you know typical Jew right but if you said it to them they'd be like what the fuck you trying to say right and you're like and and here's the thing I was trying to think of last night so we were I wanted to talk to you about the thing you're doing so I was like it's really brilliant and and one of the things I was thinking is like it's [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7631.7s)]
*  possible that we don't have white people don't have a word that is as explosive or volatile to us that means so much and so like maybe we can't we can't understand no way we can't understand but it's crazy just as a word that the flip side of it is they can use it and it just sounds fine yeah it doesn't offend anybody we're all just sitting there everyone's laughing it makes times better it's really it's a weird word Snoop said it Snoop said it to me when I was [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7661.7s)]
*  walking we were at this event I told you and I said I want to go hang out with Snoop and Leanne's like can't you hang out with Snoop I go he's my friend if we can't hang out then we're not friends so I went over I said to the guy I was like tell Papa Bert's here and he was like what? No and I was like just tell Papa Bert's here and he's like who's Papa? I go just yell Papa Bert's here he goes Papa Bert's here and he's like yeah dog wants to see him and then I just walked through I went back [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7691.7s)]
*  first words out of Snoop's mouth my end and I felt so much love I felt so much fucking love right I felt so much love isn't that crazy that word is so it's just as a word it's so fascinating and if I and now the exact opposite if I had said that to him oh yeah it would have ruined the night oh yeah yeah and I and we're aware of that social interaction but at the same time there's like there is there there was [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7721.7s)]
*  this time where where people thought like I remember reading the word in high school during reading Huck Finn reading it aloud and Huck Finn reading it aloud is that still in it or did they change the words I don't know because I think I think some let's find out what what's going on with that because I feel like I read that that there was some call to remove that word from Huckleberry Finn yeah [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7751.7s)]
*  yeah yeah it's like well remember the Chevy chase routine with Richard Pryor yeah yeah fuck yeah on SNL I mean it's it was interesting too there's a period of time where Quentin Tarantino had white people saying in his movies yeah well he said it a bunch of times in pulp fiction Alabama publisher says expurgation is that the right word expurgation [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7780.7s)]
*  of more than 200 hurtful epithets will counter preemptive censorship that has seen Mark Twain's yeah okay it censors the n-word what do they use in replace of that word just call him Jim [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7810.7s)]
*  you're reading the words read all the words oh my god they're gonna replace it with the word slave wait what wow and the new edition the word will be replaced in each instance by slave the word engine will also be replaced in the text I wonder what that's the [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=7828.66s)]

*  took a couple pieces of advice from it's very good advice in the smaller room the [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=9994.0s)]
*  stage was too large he's like why is the stage so big I'm like why is this why is [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=9999.16s)]
*  the stage so big because I think the stage should be about four feet shorter [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10003.72s)]
*  on each side I was like we could do that okay yeah and he's like in the ceiling [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10006.96s)]
*  can you make it lower and I'm like yeah we can make it large it was already low [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10012.24s)]
*  how low is that ceiling I mean it's pretty fucking low it feels good doesn't [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10015.54s)]
*  feel you you like intimate it's boxed in with those folks it reminds you the old [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10019.94s)]
*  school New York days where you can put your hand on the ceiling yeah those kind [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10024.1s)]
*  of clubs so he had that that was his suggestion there to make the stage [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10027.86s)]
*  smaller in the little room and make the ceiling even lower so we did that and [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10033.220000000001s)]
*  then in the next room the ceiling we lowered the ceiling that was his other [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10036.94s)]
*  suggestion too and then he had some good suggestions about soundproofing [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10042.98s)]
*  because I think a lot of comedians they'd like the sound of the echo because [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10046.76s)]
*  it makes loud laughs louder but it also makes it more difficult to people to [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10050.64s)]
*  understand what you're saying it's harder because it's like echoey like in [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10055.34s)]
*  the Vulcan it was a little echoey it was great when you were killing right because [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10060.22s)]
*  the laughs are so loud but some parts of the room and you're getting like sound [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10063.74s)]
*  bouncing off of a bunch of shit you won't you miss subtle things you miss [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10069.34s)]
*  certain things yeah so he was like you know you got to make sure that [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10073.5s)]
*  everything's like soft and the sound is like everything soundproofed we did that [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10076.26s)]
*  when this last tour we were doing arenas and I upgraded my package to have like [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10083.06s)]
*  like a legit lighting package and legit sound brought in mm-hmm and it changed [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10088.02s)]
*  those arenas it's a game changer like this I remember saying as the first [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10092.62s)]
*  person that did I go you're gonna fall in love with the sound of this it's not [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10096.06s)]
*  just you're set up an arena and it's whatever sound they have it's like it's [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10099.02s)]
*  like they do this whole presentation before to dial in the exact sound points [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10102.779999999999s)]
*  and it is it sounds like you're in a comedy club so is this worth it to you [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10106.699999999999s)]
*  to do when because you're doing so many shows so it's easy just they come with [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10110.98s)]
*  you they travel with you yeah pay 1.7 no I like this I like this I like the [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na9GQBTKS80&t=10114.58s)]
