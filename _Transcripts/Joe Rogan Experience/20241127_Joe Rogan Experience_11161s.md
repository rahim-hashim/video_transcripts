# Joe Rogan Experience #2235 - Mike Rowe
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpx_2eUyvqc)
*  We got stars, we got coffee, we got Mike Roe, we got Carl's over there snoring.
*  So what were you doing on QVC?
*  What were you selling?
*  That was the greatest line from Blazing Saddles by the way, when Gene Hackman.
*  What's the line?
*  He says, cigars, remember?
*  Peter Boyle has come, he had just left and Gene Hackman is there after getting the soup
*  spilled in his lap and he's basically saying, I had cigars as the creature stomps off in
*  Frankenstein.
*  I don't remember that.
*  It's been too long since I've seen that movie.
*  He's a little bit of a fucking distraction.
*  Can he calm down?
*  We hear him, we don't have our headphones on.
*  Maybe we should put our headphones on.
*  I thought you were talking about me.
*  No, Carl.
*  For an awful moment.
*  We wore him out.
*  Jamie was throwing the toy for Carl.
*  He's such a great dog.
*  He's got, I mean, he's adorable.
*  I mean, it's such a personality thing at that, for me with dogs and pets in general, you
*  know, like, you know right away if this thing has a personality.
*  Oh, he's got a lot of, Carl's got a lot of personality.
*  There's no doubt about that.
*  Yeah, and a little kid.
*  And a person name, which I think is super interesting.
*  Mine's Freddy.
*  He's a terrier.
*  I like a dog with a person name.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  Like Fido?
*  What the fuck is a Fido?
*  No one knows.
*  Well, that's, well, actually, oh no, that's Filo.
*  I was thinking of Clint Eastwood in Every Which Way But Loose.
*  He was Filo Beto.
*  Could also be Filo Farnsworth who created the television.
*  For real?
*  Yeah.
*  Did only one guy do it or was it one of those like light bulb type deals where like a
*  bunch of people are scrambling for it and Thomas Edison kind of.
*  What do they call that?
*  Like a hive mentality.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Like that happened with the integrated circuit, right?
*  When Kilby at Radio Shack was doing the same basic work I think that Robert Noyce was doing
*  for Intel.
*  And one was here in Texas and the other was in California.
*  And they had never met and they had never compared notes.
*  But the work on the circuitry was so close that they wound up sharing the Nobel Prize.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  Super strange.
*  But that, you know, I don't know.
*  That's a common thing with human beings and it's this concept of morphic resonance.
*  Have you ever heard of that concept?
*  Rupert Sheldrake, he wrote about this and the ideas and it's based on some actual facts
*  too about there's some real statistics about rats.
*  Like if you teach a rat how to run a maze on the East Coast, a rat on the West Coast
*  will run it faster.
*  It's like they learn the pattern somehow or another.
*  It's very bizarre.
*  There's like information that's apparently shared across species.
*  And the idea is that somehow or another they're quantumly entangled.
*  Like that the entire group of these specific types of animals are quantumly entangled or
*  entangled in some way that we don't understand.
*  So it's a kind of I mean, I would think biological evolution might flirt with that.
*  I read a paper a guy wrote named Patrick House.
*  This was his PhD and he was talking about toxoplasma gondii and histoplasmosis.
*  And it was a crazy paper.
*  His real premise was trying to understand the phenomenon of the cat lady and why like
*  every culture like this isn't unique to America.
*  In every culture you can find a woman who, you know, two cats, three cats maybe, but
*  like went all the way to 38.
*  And just was like this perfectly normal.
*  So his paper was what happens to a person's brain to tell it it's normal to have 38 cats.
*  And then it gets super complicated because he identifies a gondii that lives in the cat's
*  gut and basically breeds there.
*  And what he learned was when the cats were crapping, the gondii would come out.
*  And then the rats and the mice that ate the cat crap, something was happening to their
*  brains on a neurological level.
*  This gondii basically disabled the part of the brain that would tell an otherwise sentient
*  rat to run from the cat.
*  But suddenly they weren't running.
*  They became prey and they became docile.
*  And the cats started obliterating the mice and rat population because this thing that
*  was breeding in its ass was effectively making its prey easier to catch.
*  So Dr. House thought, well, you know, we've all heard about why pregnant women should
*  stay away from cats because that can have an effect.
*  And a rat's brain and a human brain have a surprising number of parallels.
*  So he basically postulated that, you know, Doris the cat lady was living a fairly normal
*  life until she got just a little bit of catch on her fingers and ate it.
*  And the gondii disabled the part of her brain that said, hey, maybe two cats is enough.
*  It's worse than that.
*  It actually makes the rats sexually attracted to the smell of cat urine.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, it actually makes them aroused.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, I don't know if Doris went that far with her feelings.
*  Have you ever seen them like run up to cats?
*  The toxo infected rats?
*  It's bizarre.
*  They run right up to them.
*  The cat's like, what the fuck is going on?
*  The cats like bounce away from the rat.
*  It's like watching the Beatles at the Ed Sullivan Theater.
*  You know, people are like, what's wrong with you people?
*  Why?
*  What's happening?
*  Mass psychosis.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's super interesting.
*  Did the most disproportionate number of motorcycle victims attest positive for toxo?
*  They did not.
*  Yeah, it makes people more impulsive.
*  It makes them more reckless and impulsive.
*  And countries that have high rates of toxoplasma have more successful soccer teams.
*  I read and I think this-
*  I got more of these too.
*  I don't want to compete.
*  I'm going to lose.
*  But you'll love this.
*  You probably already know it.
*  Homeostatic risk and risk equilibrium and the unintended consequences, especially with
*  motorcycle riders that emanate from safety protocols gone too far.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So like every- like if you study the way you drive your motorcycle, like you measure every
*  decision that you make in terms of cornering and speed and braking and all that stuff.
*  And then you measure the same things with all the safety gear employed, including a
*  helmet, especially a helmet.
*  You drive faster.
*  You corner tighter.
*  You take more chances because the risk equilibrium that we all have in our brain is different
*  from one person to the next.
*  But what's the same is our desire to compensate for the environment around us.
*  So compensatory risk and the subconscious decisions that we might make behind the wheel
*  when we're buckled up versus not buckled up, when we have ABS brakes as opposed to not
*  having them.
*  They did a big survey in Berlin years ago where they took half of the taxis and they
*  put in state of the art braking systems in half of them and left the others the same.
*  And then they hooked up the cars to monitor every driver decision.
*  And in virtually every case, the drivers with the better safety gear took more chances because
*  their brain is subconsciously compensating.
*  Right?
*  It's the same-
*  Makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's controversial, but I understand it.
*  It's why the most dangerous intersections have signs that tell you when to walk and
*  when not to walk and have crossed.
*  Because the little man is walking, it says go, so you step off and there's the big blue
*  bus and then you're spattered.
*  So yeah, the unintended consequences of following traditional safety protocols has always really
*  been interesting.

*  ZipRecruiter the smartest way to hire.
*  Well, it completely makes sense if you have a vehicle that's more able and capable, you're
*  going to probably drive it faster and you're probably going to take more risks because
*  it can do stuff.
*  Like I used to think I used to have a Lexus SUV, this big boat Lexus.
*  And you know what I loved about it?
*  I drove slow in it.
*  I was just like real because it doesn't stop that good.
*  It's not that fast, but it's just it's big and comfortable and it just chilled me out.
*  And then I had an M3, I had two cars at the time and my M3 was a zippy little thing and
*  I was flying around that thing.
*  I was like, why do I drive different in this fucking car than I do in the big car?
*  The big car would just chill me out.
*  I just get in that big old boat and I just, sure.
*  The world was like quiet out there.
*  It's nice and relaxed.
*  I think it's a slightly different analysis.
*  Like if you're going to adjust your behavior consciously to adapt to the externality, right?
*  Like you know, you're going to drive faster if you have a fast car because you know that's
*  why the guy built the thing.
*  And it would almost be rude, right?
*  It would be rude to drive a hot rod like a boat.
*  It's the unconscious things that you do when you assume or mitigate risk as a result of
*  employing an externality that I think is just super interesting.
*  It is interesting.
*  Well, because if it's right, Joe, if it's right, what it does is it turns all the safety
*  first protocols not necessarily on their head, but this happened in Dirty Jobs.
*  I did a whole special called Safety Third because safety isn't really first, not really ever.
*  Because if it was, you would never get a lot of things done.
*  Well, you'd never get out of the studio.
*  You would definitely never do construction.
*  Heck no. No, you wouldn't do anything.
*  You wouldn't do anything.
*  It's a, you know, I...
*  How are you going to move steel girders of safeties first?
*  You'd be like, first thing we should do is not move this fucking girder.
*  That's right.
*  This thing's too big.
*  That's right.
*  Look, I mean, for me, it was really a...
*  It took two years to kind of puzzle it through because on Dirty Jobs for the first two years,
*  nobody got hurt.
*  You know, we were...
*  And we sat through probably 50 mandatory safety briefings, whether it's mines or confined
*  spaces or high spaces or, you know, lockout, tag out, all those protocols and procedures
*  were super intense.
*  And we were really, really focused on coming home alive and in one piece.
*  So we like really paid attention.
*  But after two years of these mandatory compulsory meetings and all of these procedures,
*  we all started getting hurt.
*  I mean, not nothing serious, but broken fingers and, you know, cracked rib and singed off
*  my eyebrows and my eyelashes and mild concussions and things like that.
*  I was like, what the hell's happening?
*  What was happening is the safety experts in all of these mandatory meetings started to
*  sound like...
*  Remember Charlie Brown's teacher?
*  Mrs. Oathmar.
*  We were just falling asleep.
*  So it was like, holy crap, we're in compliance, but we are not out of danger.
*  And so that begs the question, what happens to a normal person who actually comes to believe
*  either on the job site or just in life that somebody else cares more about their wellbeing
*  than they do?
*  And it's like, that's when complacency rears its ugly head.
*  So on Dirty Jobs, it was just shorthand among the crew, but it was always safety third,
*  which meant heads up, man.
*  Keep your head on a swivel.
*  You can be as compliant as you want.
*  But in the end, if you don't want to fall off the bridge, it's kind of on you.
*  Is there also a factor when you have a person who's the safety officer, who's kind of annoying
*  and they're really super interested and maybe you kind of pawn off the safety aspect to
*  them and then you don't think about it as much because someone's supposedly looking
*  out for you?
*  How much do you think about proper driving technique when you're sitting in the back
*  on your laptop or even up front next to it?
*  Depends on who's driving.
*  For sure.
*  If I was driving and my wife is in the backseat, she'd be paying attention a lot.
*  Shout out to your guy, what was his name?
*  Ashton, who picked me up this morning.
*  Excellent driver, man.
*  Glad you're happy with it.
*  Just so you know.
*  I mean, I know he drives a lot of your guests and this is a feedback I want to pass along.
*  He was very frosty.
*  But yeah, look, I think any time that we abdicate...
*  Responsibility.
*  Yeah.
*  There's going to be...
*  It's like whack-a-mole.
*  It's going to pop up someplace else and it's probably not going to be in your interest.
*  Well, your show sort of illuminated a lot of really crazy jobs that people probably
*  weren't aware of that you go, oh yeah, if this guy didn't do this, we'd kind of be fucked
*  and you don't even think about it.
*  It's just a thing that's going on behind the scenes or out of your radar.
*  That was it, man.
*  It was...
*  How did you get started in that?
*  Who came up with the concept?
*  Well, I mean, technically I guess I did, but I mean, honestly, there are no, no ideas.
*  I stole this from George Plimpton, Studs Terkel a little bit, Charles Kuralt, some, Paul Harvey
*  a little bit.
*  That kind of storytelling was always kind of interesting to me.
*  I freelanced for years, probably 20 years in the entertainment business, working pretty
*  much whenever I wanted on shows that I didn't care about at all.
*  I was taking my retirement in early installments and really happy with the model.
*  I'd been fired a few times from QVC and hired back and it was 1993 when I finally left and
*  I had a decent toolbox.
*  I was great in auditions so I could get cast, but I didn't really much care about the nature
*  of the work and had a pretty good balanced life, really.
*  And then I was in San Francisco working for CBS on a show called Evening Magazine, you
*  know the show, it comes on after, like the local news.
*  And I was a host and I would go every day.
*  This is a cushy gig, nobody watched the show, but it was fun to work on.
*  It was, you go to museums, you go to wineries and then you throw to these wrapped packages,
*  right?
*  It's all just, if there's a three-legged dog in Marin overcoming a heart-tugging case
*  of canine kidney failure, you know, that was like an Evening Magazine story.
*  We did these all the time.
*  My mom called me and I was in my cubicle at CBS and she says, Michael, your grandfather
*  will be 90 years old tomorrow.
*  And my granddad, by the way, seventh grade education, electrical contractor by trade,
*  but also a plumber and a steam fitter, pipe, fabricate, fix anything.
*  He had that chip, you know, and I grew up next to him on this little farmstead north
*  of Baltimore and I knew I was going to follow in his footsteps.
*  I knew it.
*  But the handy gene is recessive, right?
*  I didn't get that.
*  And it was my pop who got me.
*  He basically said, dude, just get a different, you can be a tradesman.
*  I know you're enamored of being a tradesman.
*  Just get a different toolbox.
*  So that's what got me into entertainment.
*  And 20 years later, I had completely run amok.
*  I had sung in the opera, I'd sold stuff on QVC.
*  You sang opera?
*  Eight years, man.
*  Did you, were you classically trained?
*  Not really.
*  How do you get involved in opera singing?
*  Well, it's a weird, sidebar, you go to the Rosedale Public Library and you ask the librarian
*  for the shortest aria they have, like ever written, which happened to be by Giacomo Puccini.
*  Is an aria a song?
*  An aria is a song.
*  It's the, they're in an opera.
*  Most of the big moments are arias, right?
*  And most of the arias are, you know, I mean, they're sung by the main characters and there
*  are lots of ones that you would recognize.
*  And in German, they're in Italian for the most part.
*  This one was Italian.
*  It was from La Boheme, which is just another version of Rent, essentially.
*  But it was called the Cote Aria.
*  And it was only two minutes long and it was in Italian.
*  So I walked around Baltimore with, you remember the Sony Walkman?
*  Yeah, I remember.
*  I had one of those.
*  I had one too.
*  And I listened to a guy named Samuel Raimi singing the Cote Aria, about two minutes and
*  40 seconds.
*  And the words didn't mean anything to me, but the sounds did.
*  And I can carry a tune, so I just memorized the sounds.
*  And then I crashed an audition for the Baltimore Opera in 1983.
*  No classic training at all, just a Walkman and a cassette.
*  Yeah, I'd had a music teacher prior to that, like a Mr. Holland type of guy who actually
*  changed my life.
*  He kind of fixed a stammer that I had.
*  And then he forced me to audition for plays that I didn't really want to be in.
*  And then the craziest thing ever, this guy, his name was Fred King.
*  He was known as King of the Barber Shoppers.
*  He was like a legend in this weird world of a cappella singing.
*  And he put me in a barbershop quartet when I was in high school and opened up like this
*  very weird world of music written long before I was born that I found super interesting.
*  And so my best friends and I, we just started learning these ancient songs and singing for
*  people, usually unsolicited from nursing.
*  What kind of fucking dudes are you hanging out with that were interested in doing this with you?
*  Well, one of them is basically my producer guy called Chuck Klausmeyer, who I went to high school with,
*  produces my podcast.
*  And we'll write unauthorized jingles for our sponsors and sing them in four part harmony.
*  I'm not saying it's cool.
*  I'm just saying it's a thing that I did when I was young and I never really shook it.
*  Because like way leads on to way.
*  So you knew how to sing.
*  I could carry it to you.
*  So you had some experience singing kind of.
*  And then you decided you were going to learn how to sing opera.
*  Well, what really happened was I decided that my toolbox wasn't going to let me work
*  in the construction trades or do anything my pop could do.
*  And he really was a magician and I really took his advice seriously.
*  So I wanted to be in entertainment.
*  I didn't want to be in the opera.
*  I wanted to be on TV.
*  But I needed an agent and I couldn't get an agent unless I had my Screen Actors Guild
*  card and I couldn't get my SAG card unless I had an agent.
*  So I couldn't audition for things that I wanted to do unless I found a way around this weird
*  tautology.
*  And a friend of mine, a guy called Mike Gellert, told me, he said, hey, so there's the Screen
*  Actors Guild there.
*  At the time there was AFTRA and I'm sure you were part of both.
*  The thing you didn't know about was AGMA.
*  The American Guild of Musical Artists is a sister union to the Screen Actors Guild and
*  to AFTRA who have since combined.
*  And the rule back then was if you could get into any of them, you could simply pay your
*  dues to the other and then you were in.
*  So for me, it was easier to kind of fake my way into the opera than it was onto a sitcom.
*  So my plan...
*  This is all diabolical.
*  Well, it's a great plan.
*  I mean, it's like that kind of strategic thinking is very valid.
*  You should be in the Navy or something.
*  Well, look, I was just trying to get a job.
*  I know, but it's clever.
*  There's always a stage door, right?
*  I mean, there's always a back way in.
*  And so I thought, you know, I memorized the aria.
*  I auditioned.
*  I was stopped halfway through it by the musical director, a guy named Bill Yannuzzi, who's
*  like, Mr. Rowe, you have no idea what you're saying at all, do you?
*  Because you're saying the words wrong.
*  You're just repeating the sounds.
*  I was singing it loud and I was singing it like I understood what I was saying.
*  All I really understood was the repertory company was desperate for young men with low voices.
*  I knew that.
*  And so I kind of looked the part.
*  So whatever, I got into it and my plan was to do one production or one season.
*  Like they would do three shows in a season.
*  And I had some friends who were in the chorus and I was just a chorus member.
*  I'm just holding a spear and just sing along with the rest of the chorus.
*  And my plan was to do one or two of those, get my card and then buy my sag card and then
*  go about the business of being a famous TV star.
*  Right.
*  Simple.
*  Well, the music, the music was so much better than I imagined it might be.
*  And like when you get up in the catwalks of like a real theater, you know, I mean,
*  you've done shows in these theaters.
*  It's just nothing magically different about them.
*  But when there's a full orchestra playing the hell out of Verdi or Rachmaninoff and
*  you're looking down on the scene and you're looking out at the audience and the sound is just
*  just amazing.
*  And the girls, so like they're, well, there were 80, 80 people, I guess, in the rep company,
*  more or less, 45 women, 35 guys.
*  30 of the guys had zero interest in 100% of the women and of the remaining five straight dudes,
*  three were married and the only other single guy had a mold the size of your thumb on his
*  eyelid with thick black hair growing out of it.
*  It was just, I was the really the only straight dude.
*  You were the belle of the ball.
*  And I'm dressed like a Viking or a pirate.
*  And I'm going on stage and I'm a fake.
*  I mean, I admit it.
*  I barely learned the language enough to kind of keep up and people in the chorus took pity on me.
*  It was a world, really.
*  It was a world that I didn't know existed.
*  And once I saw it, I didn't fall in love with it, but I fell in love with the idea that there were
*  worlds out there that I didn't know anything about and that were maybe more interesting than
*  I thought.
*  And so I stayed for eight years.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I never got out of the chorus.
*  I never had like a, you know, a featured role at a couple lines here and there,
*  but the Baltimore Opera was a big deal looking back at it.
*  And that was for me, 83 to 90.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And then, oh Christ, since we're talking about it was a Sunday.
*  And during the intermission of something, I think it was during this Nibelungan,
*  this giant Wagner epic, torturous thing.
*  And the chorus didn't have to be, this is the one you saw it on Bugs Bunny.
*  Killed a rabbit, killed a what?
*  It's that one, right?
*  Right.
*  So there's an intermission and I'm not needed on stage for like 40 minutes after the intermission.
*  So I go across the street to the Mount Royal Tavern to drink a beer and watch the football
*  game dressed as a Viking, which I recommend by the way, when you walk in a bar with the horns
*  and the spear, the bartender knew me.
*  Everybody laughed and I sat down, but the game wasn't on.
*  The bartender was watching a fat guy in a shiny suit selling pots and pans.
*  And it was the early days of the QVC cable shopping channel.
*  I'm like, Rick, why are we watching this?
*  And he says, because I'm auditioning for that guy's job tomorrow morning.
*  QVC was doing a national talent search.
*  Anyway, we had a conversation about the end of Western civilization and what it meant for
*  polite society to have a 24 hour infomercial that just never went away and whether or not
*  there was any honor at all in auditioning for such a thing.
*  And at that point I thought it'd be great to have some money.
*  I hadn't had any before.
*  I'm sitting there drinking this beer dressed as a Viking thinking I could probably do that job
*  if I had to.
*  So I went with him the next day and auditioned and got hired.
*  Wow.
*  Was he mad?
*  The bartender?
*  Yeah.
*  That you got the gig?
*  You know.
*  Because he didn't even know about it.
*  Well, it's a good question.
*  I don't know what became of him.
*  We had a friendly-
*  He's probably got a fucking voodoo doll of Mike Rowe.
*  Got a bunch of pins in it.
*  We had a wager.
*  I said, look, I don't know if I'll get the job, but I bet I'll get a callback.
*  He was like, you're not going to get a callback for this thing.
*  We were just actors at the time.
*  We're like people pretending to be actors trying to find work.
*  He's not a big hater.
*  You know, he was nice enough.
*  He sang in the opera with me too.
*  Actually, he also attended bar.
*  He just wasn't in that one.
*  But yeah, it was a very strange thing, man.
*  That was my first job in TV.
*  I've done some minor local commercial stuff, but I talked about a pencil for eight minutes.
*  That was the audition.
*  It was so strange in those days.
*  They didn't have a-
*  Like there's no playbook to see who can sell stuff on TV.
*  You know?
*  Do you have a script or you just kind of like you have this facts about the pencil?
*  No, nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  Here's what happens.
*  Again, it's probably changed today.
*  I think QVC did $8 billion last year.
*  Back in 1989, 1990, it was nothing like that.
*  And if they hired a salesman, that didn't mean you had anybody who understood
*  really how to behave on TV.
*  And if you hired a TV person, that didn't really mean you-
*  Look at you.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  That's the cat sack right there, dude.
*  That's a sack for your cat.
*  What are you selling?
*  Let me hear this.
*  A sack for your cat?
*  What the fuck?
*  It's just crazy.
*  They just love it.
*  That's why this is a cat toy.
*  So the cats play with it?
*  Yeah, they crawl inside it.
*  And they just go nutty because it makes a lot of noise?
*  Costs $25.
*  That's $25.
*  So this is like sort of just personality, fucking around, having fun with the toy,
*  and selling it.
*  Well, that's what I did.
*  Look, remember-
*  That's what you did.
*  Was that novel that you were doing it that way?
*  Yeah.
*  In relative terms, that was actually one of the true great life lessons.
*  You don't have to be outrageous to stand out.
*  You just have to be relatively outrageous.
*  So QVC was a steady diet of men and women doing the same exact thing all the time.
*  And then at midnight or 3 a.m., I showed up and put a cat bag over my head or busted open a lava lamp.
*  So you were like a morning DJ?
*  Kind of, except-
*  Right, because they're kind of fun, and that was different than the regular radio guy.
*  You know, I mean, for me, I thought of it more like my favorite comedians.
*  And by the way, I saw one last night.
*  Thank you.
*  Ron White was over at the mothership.
*  He's there tonight, too.
*  I stopped by last night.
*  Are you around tonight?
*  No, I got to get back tonight.
*  Something about Thanksgiving.
*  But I watched his set last night.
*  He's awesome.
*  He was great.
*  He's never been funnier.
*  He's in top form right now.
*  And he's gone.
*  He's gone full Messiah, dude.
*  I didn't recognize him.
*  Oh, with the look?
*  He said hello, and I'm like, hey, how are you?
*  You're back.
*  Jesus, good to see you.
*  He was great.
*  And as I watched him do his thing, it reminded me, like my favorite comedians,
*  I never get the sense that they're trying to make me laugh.
*  I get the sense that they're trying to amuse themselves.
*  Right.
*  And that's what makes it comfortable for me to be in the audience, to see somebody who,
*  hey, if I laugh, that's just a happy symptom of whatever it is you're going to do anyway.
*  It makes me comfortable.
*  And that's why he's fun to watch.
*  That's why this podcast is fun to listen to.
*  Same reason.
*  I couldn't have articulated that 35 years ago, sitting there selling a cat sack.
*  But you intuitively knew something.
*  I knew in the middle of the night, like everything that it turned out that I needed to know
*  about this crazy business, I learned in the middle of the night on the QVC cable shopping channel
*  over a three year period, trying to make sense.
*  What were the shifts?
*  So three hours at a time, usually, over the course of 24 hours.
*  So you would be on three hours at a time?
*  Yeah.
*  Would you come back again or would you only do three hours?
*  I do three hours and I go home.
*  I mean, have you done overnights before?
*  No.
*  So I guarantee you there are a lot of people listening who have worked an overnight shift
*  in their trade, in their vocation.
*  It changes you.
*  Just as surely as Doris the Cat Lady's brain was scrambled by the Gandhi eye and the toxo.
*  It does something.
*  Your circadian rhythm?
*  It's not just that.
*  It is that.
*  But it's something primal, even more primal than that.
*  It just messes with you and it forces you.
*  For me, it changed colors.
*  It changed taste.
*  It changed.
*  Yeah, because I had never, I mean, I was upside down.
*  After I talked about a pencil for eight minutes, I was on the air 48 hours later,
*  at three in the morning, trying to make sense of the health team infrared pain relief.
*  And the amcor negative ion generator.
*  Like, what the hell?
*  Did they give you a rundown of what these products were at all?
*  It was up to you.
*  If you came in a couple hours early and you took the time to look through,
*  like there was a table like this with all of the stuff on it that you were going to be selling.
*  And you could take the time to prepare.
*  But there was no Google back then.
*  It's not like you could just watch a YouTube video that would explain what this thing did.
*  No, what you got was a blue card, usually from the manufacturer,
*  that said a couple of sentences about what the thing was.
*  You had an item number, you had the price, the retail price, the QVC price,
*  and maybe some easy payment terms.
*  All the stuff, right?
*  But it was just a blue card.
*  And then you would kind of go off and think about how you would make sense out of this skull
*  and where it came from and why it's interesting.
*  It's feature benefit selling.
*  And if you understand that, you can talk about anything for as long as you need to.
*  You never talk about a feature without talking about its benefit.
*  And so that's kind of how that world worked.
*  So you don't say it's a pencil for 99 cents.
*  You say it's a yellow number two pencil with an eraser that is of the exact proportion necessary
*  to last for the life of the pencil.
*  So when this thing is down to a nub, you'll still have enough eraser left.
*  It's really a monument to efficiency and ingenuity.
*  And it's not just yellow.
*  It's yellow because you're a busy professional.
*  And when you need a pencil, Joe, when you open up your drawer,
*  you don't have time to root around for some vaguely beige colored writing implement.
*  You want that canary yellow to pop and you can pick it up.
*  And it's a number two pencil.
*  It's not three with that thin wispy line that you can't read
*  or that thick disappointing skid mark of a number one.
*  So you just train yourself to fill dead air with nonsense.
*  While you're fucking up your circadian rhythm.
*  Yeah.
*  While you're wondering when your next meal is and who you're going to have it with.
*  And you wind up making friends and essentially hanging with other people
*  who live in that same weird like shadow land.
*  Yeah, shadow land.
*  That's a good way to put it.
*  I have kind of an experience with overnight, but it's not the same.
*  I delivered newspapers and so at least one day a week on Sunday,
*  I would basically show up Saturday night at three in the morning.
*  Right.
*  Because you would I would deliver Sunday papers and the Sunday papers were it was a huge under.
*  You had flipped the top.
*  Oh, I forgot the flip the top.
*  And then hit the button.
*  There you go.
*  Hit it again.
*  Hey, all right.
*  And so I was all fucked up from that.
*  I would get up every day at five o'clock in the morning.
*  Normally to deliver papers because that a large route.
*  Yeah.
*  It was my way to make money without having to do a job where I had to listen to anybody.
*  It's also a perfect example of a kind of job
*  where you always know how you're doing while you're doing it.
*  Like lots and lots of little visual undeniable cues.
*  You got to your bags or your baskets full of paper or your car or whatever you were doing.
*  I was in a car.
*  You're tossing them out one at a time.
*  You're making progress.
*  You know the progress you're making as you make it.
*  Right.
*  You know you only have 120 houses to go.
*  That's right.
*  And then it's 110.
*  And then it's like people go to Dunkin Donuts,
*  get yourself a nice donut and a coffee, reward yourself days over.
*  Yeah.
*  My day would be done work wise by you know 8 a.m., 9 a.m. on a Sunday.
*  Nine was rough.
*  Occasionally they would make enormous Sunday papers.
*  There'd be a real problem because you have to make multiple trips.
*  And I bought a van.
*  So I had a big cargo van and I drove that around to deliver newspapers for a while.
*  That made it a lot easier because I could stack 350 Sunday papers in the back of that van.
*  But see you remember and you knew.
*  350 that's an interesting number.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's it.
*  I had bigger routes but 350 was manageable.
*  How old were you?
*  I started when I was just driving.
*  So I was in high school still.
*  So I think I started delivering papers when I was 17 or 18.
*  Whatever legal age they allow you to do it.
*  So it was probably 17 or 18.
*  I started driving and I drove till I was
*  22.
*  I just started doing stand up comedy.
*  I drove all throughout my competitive martial arts career.
*  I drove in the morning.
*  It was good because it gave me discipline.
*  Because I had to do it seven days a week 365 days a year.
*  You did not take any days off.
*  It didn't matter if it snowed or rained or frozen rain on the streets.
*  Black ice.
*  Didn't matter.
*  You got to deliver newspapers.
*  And if they did delay it you would just.
*  It would delay your delivery of the paper.
*  So you'd have to call the depot.
*  Hey are we delivering yet?
*  Because they didn't want to be responsible.
*  It was a blizzard for people dying and get lawsuits.
*  So they didn't make you deliver papers.
*  It was unbelievably bad out.
*  But for the most part you drove every day.
*  So you had a sense of consequence too.
*  Yes.
*  Like you.
*  Discipline consequence.
*  Yeah.
*  You didn't deliver the papers.
*  You didn't get paid.
*  It was very simple.
*  It was a very simple job.
*  I don't even remember how they trained us.
*  I think that maybe they trained us for like one day.
*  You were taught how to fold the paper.
*  One.
*  Two.
*  Stuff it in the bag.
*  You had plastic bags were great because you could chuck them out the window and it never
*  damaged the paper.
*  Rubber bands are a real pain in the ass because you could hit a corner on the concrete.
*  It would rip the corner of the paper and then the customer would complain because they're
*  trying to read about what's going on in Syria and then there's this fucking broken piece of paper.
*  I delivered the New York Times only because it was cool.
*  I delivered the Boston Globe because that was the biggest distribution.
*  Like I could get the biggest route and then the Boston Herald because I wanted more papers
*  to deliver so I would do two papers and then New York Times.
*  The New York Times is a pain in the ass because it would be like one every 10 blocks.
*  You'd have an enormous route.
*  If you had 150 New York Times that's an all day excursion.
*  Did you start to equate the type of home you were delivering the type of paper to?
*  Yes.
*  The New York Times people took themselves very seriously.
*  They were very serious people.
*  They would ask me what I'm doing with my life.
*  I remember this lady.
*  I was taking courses at Boston University just so people wouldn't think I was a loser.
*  It was literally the only reason why I was going to college.
*  She's asking me, I was like, what are you planning on doing with your career?
*  I'm like, I have no idea.
*  She didn't like it.
*  She didn't like that I had no idea.
*  Yeah, it makes people uncomfortable.
*  She liked me but she didn't like that I had no idea.
*  She was like very motherly to me, I guess.
*  It's funny.
*  We had the Baltimore Sun, which was the paper of record.
*  And then we had the News American, which was sort of like the upstart.
*  And I never thought too much about the difference between the two
*  until summertime and crabs.
*  Maryland blue crabs are a big thing.
*  They're a big thing in my family, big thing where I grew up.
*  And everybody who eats crabs in the summer eats them outside on a picnic table.
*  And you lay the newspaper out.
*  But which one, Joe?
*  Which one?
*  It matters.
*  I don't know why it does.
*  So is it disrespectful to use the paper of note?
*  No.
*  No, it's better.
*  No, I think it's a mark of respect.
*  It's like, oh, we're having crabs, get the News American.
*  That's so silly.
*  Get the News American.
*  Because it's all spread out in front of you and you got the crab guts in the Old Bay and
*  the J.O. number two and the National Bohemian beer.
*  And maybe you can glance down and get informed.
*  Isn't it interesting that there are newspapers like that?
*  Right?
*  Like there's the New York Post.
*  You want a fun headline.
*  You want all the crazy shit like what happened?
*  Who got pregnant?
*  What's going on with this?
*  What's going on with that?
*  And then you have the New York Times where it's important to put tampons in the boys room.
*  What is happening?
*  Have you ever walked through the offices of the Post?
*  No.
*  Any chance?
*  No.
*  Dude, it's amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  I had a old girlfriend whose sister worked there.
*  Worked for page six.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the fun one.
*  Yeah, so much fun.
*  So that's like all the gossip and the craziness and this person's getting arrested.
*  And right, right.
*  Drunk driving and hookers.
*  They have a hallway.
*  It's like this place in the center.
*  There's so much on the walls, but it's all front pages.
*  And it's the best headlines.
*  So it's the best ones they've ever come up with?
*  The best ones ever.
*  Starting with the classic headless body found in topless bar, which is still tough to beat.
*  That's great.
*  But so many of them.
*  I love the Post.
*  I've always loved the Post.
*  I love just the fun nature of the news.
*  That was like the working person's newspaper.
*  This is the point I was trying to make about the comedian who entertains himself first
*  and the schmuck on QVC who tries to keep himself awake before he sells the thing.
*  That's how I felt reading the Post.
*  It was like these guys somehow I'm imagining.
*  They're laughing.
*  They're laughing.
*  They're cigars and they're all in on the joke.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, yeah, we're going to report the news, but, you know, it's a lot of sharp elbows out there
*  and it's a very competitive world.
*  So what can we do to maybe get the stick a little out of our ass?
*  Just a little bit.
*  How can we be different?
*  That's what fascinates me.
*  Whether you're publishing a paper or eating a blue crab or writing a book or a song,
*  how can you in relative terms distinguish yourself, not from these other worlds and
*  other categories, but from your friends?
*  That's the trick, man.
*  Yeah, that is the trick.
*  And then there's people that want to be that person that is taken seriously,
*  that's reading the New York Times.
*  You want to be that person with their legs crossed, reading the New York Times,
*  like very serious, very serious people, very smart people, keep up to date.
*  Yeah.
*  I said to Ashton, your very excellent driver who brought me here, I said, you know,
*  it's been fun watching Joe do this thing over the last five or six years.
*  And then I kind of stopped myself in the middle and I said, actually, you know, I take it back.
*  What's been fun is watching the world catch up to it.
*  Like watching the headlines catch up to you or whoever, you really haven't changed.
*  And man, it's so interesting to watch people realize, oh, we're going to do it this way now.
*  We're going to do it this way now.
*  And that's been, whether it's comedy or whether it's music, you know, it's when culture changes,
*  it feels like there's some instigator, some jagged little pill who's pushing it forward.
*  And I guess maybe that's true.
*  But I also think there's this larger hive mentality in the audience.
*  And they start to realize, oh, there's another way to deliver a paper.
*  There's another way to do a thing.
*  And it feels new, but it's probably what you've been doing for the last 12 years.
*  Yeah, it's definitely the same way I've always done it.
*  It's just having conversations with people.
*  I like talking to people.
*  It's fun.
*  Yeah, but you make enjoy it.
*  Good.
*  I'm a curious person and I like talking to people.
*  It's real simple.
*  Yeah, but it's just because it's simple, right?
*  You make it sound like a parenthetical.
*  Oh, it's just a conversation.
*  Yeah.
*  That's only just the hardest thing there is to do.
*  But it's not really.
*  It's not.
*  Then why don't more people do it?
*  Because they don't enjoy it.
*  They don't enjoy it like I enjoy it.
*  Like some people genuinely don't like talking to people.
*  You know why?
*  Because they're interested in themselves.
*  You have to be interested in other people.
*  I think we're all connected.
*  I really firmly believe this in a non-hippie way.
*  I think it's like a scientific reality.
*  I mean, I think if we could figure out a way to study it,
*  we would recognize that we're psychically all connected
*  in some strange way.
*  And I am curious as to how someone from with a different
*  biology, different life experiences,
*  different geographic location in which they were raised,
*  how are they navigating the world and why are they
*  interested in opera?
*  What is it?
*  What got you to be a beekeeper?
*  Why are you so fascinated with painting?
*  What made you start writing music?
*  I'm interested.
*  I like talking to people.
*  So for me, it is easy.
*  It really is.
*  It's just talking to people like I would talk to people.
*  You and I could have the same exact conversation
*  if we're having dinner somewhere.
*  For sure.
*  Same conversation.
*  Yeah.
*  But again, it makes perfect sense.
*  And it's not that it's difficult.
*  It's just that very few people do it.
*  And if your explanation is because very few people
*  genuinely enjoy it, I can't disprove it.
*  You're probably right.
*  I think that's what it is.
*  You're probably right.
*  I think I just got lucky.
*  I think I just got lucky and I found a job
*  that I would be doing anyway.
*  Well, here's what I don't understand.
*  And maybe this is not even relevant,
*  but we did 350 dirty jobs,
*  probably 60 some of this thing called somebody's got to do it.
*  I don't even know.
*  Returning the favor, I think we did 100 episodes of that.
*  I don't even I couldn't tell you how many things I've narrated.
*  Hundreds.
*  If there's a wildebeest trying to get across
*  the vast reaches of the barren Serengeti, right?
*  Right.
*  Like if I could remember every episode of How the Universe Works,
*  10 years of this stuff,
*  if I could remember half of what I narrated,
*  um, that would be something.
*  I can remember a chunk,
*  but my sense is that,
*  like, I can't even remember the last 20 guests I had on my podcast.
*  And and the reason isn't because I'm not curious.
*  And it's not because I'm not,
*  because I lack the requisite intelligence to remember.
*  For me, it's just it's so much there's been no time
*  to think about what I'm going to do next.
*  And even less time to think about what I just did.
*  Right.
*  So you just talked to Josh Brolin
*  and then you talk to the musician guy, Storch.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Scott.
*  Yeah, Scott.
*  Storch.
*  And then before that, our friend Evan was in.
*  Right.
*  So like, I have a better,
*  it's easier for me to remember what you've done in the last two months than it is for me.
*  And that freaks me out.
*  And I wonder if sometimes you get over your skis to the point
*  where you've started to forget what you've done yourself.
*  Oh, yeah, there's no way to keep it all.
*  I have a bucket that's overflowing with information.
*  It's overflowing.
*  My hard drive is not capable of retaining all of it.
*  It's not possible.
*  I retain a lot, though.
*  There were a lot more than I ever would know.
*  I got an unexpected education doing this show, for sure.
*  Like, I never anticipated it.
*  Is it conscious?
*  Like, can you choose to be interested in a thing enough to know that you're not going to forget it?
*  Or does the interest just kind of bubble up and certain things stick to you?
*  The interest bubbles up and they stick.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  Yeah, like my daughter asked me a question the other day.
*  I don't even remember what the question was about,
*  but it's a very technical thing.
*  And I said, no, that's not exactly it.
*  It seems like that, but this is the reason why.
*  And they figured this out because of this.
*  And I started rattling off.
*  She's like, how the fuck do you know this?
*  She was laughing.
*  And I was like, I don't know everything.
*  I forget things.
*  I forget my own birthday.
*  But I do remember things that are fascinating.
*  I remember most things that are fascinating to me.
*  I have an unusual recall, but I've always had an unusual recall.
*  It's like I think it's a genetic thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it let me get really good at things too,
*  because I can remember like technical.
*  Like it was really good for martial arts,
*  because I can remember technical details.
*  Like really, I don't forget things.
*  See, you, to me, are the deeper end of the pool.
*  I'm more the shallow end.
*  I don't mean for that to sound comparative so much,
*  but like with martial arts, I'm interested in martial arts.
*  I'm interested in ultimate fighting.
*  I narrated The Ultimate Fighter.
*  Right.
*  I did 10 seasons of it.
*  But like that's sort of the extent.
*  Like I don't go very deep.
*  I've seen a couple, but it's like...
*  Well, there's a big giant difference between being a former competitor,
*  and also like dedicated decades of my life to martial arts.
*  It's not as simple as like I go and I do commentary.
*  I started doing martial arts when I was 15, and it changed my life.
*  It gave me discipline and a will to overcome uncomfort, discomfort,
*  and to push myself and to overcome fears
*  and to do something that's very scary and to compete.
*  And that was like, it formulated me as a teenager.
*  So I started competing competitively, like serious shit when I was like 15 years old.
*  And so we were traveling all over the country.
*  And so my social life from like 15 to 21 was completely retarded.
*  It was like retarded as in slowed down, like the real term.
*  And it was mostly just training and competing.
*  That's all I did.
*  And when the downtime, I was tired.
*  So I would just sleep a lot.
*  I was like eating, sleeping, working, and competing.
*  And then I started teaching.
*  So then I was making my living off of teaching, but not enough money.
*  So I was still delivering newspapers.
*  So I delivered newspapers in the morning and then I would teach.
*  And I was teaching at Boston University.
*  I was teaching.
*  I had my own school by the time I was 20.
*  Taekwondo?
*  Yeah.
*  So this is my point.
*  You take a deep dive when you get interested in a thing.
*  Yeah.
*  You go into the thing.
*  Comedy wasn't a hobby.
*  It became, I think, as important.
*  It becomes everything.
*  It becomes everything.
*  Almost nothing I do becomes everything.
*  Nothing?
*  Almost nothing.
*  But what are the things?
*  What becomes everything?
*  I'm not sure yet.
*  Let me think about it.
*  Is there one thing that if you have free time, you super look forward to doing?
*  Like you have a hobby?
*  Do you play golf?
*  No.
*  Nothing?
*  I don't have hobbies and I don't collect things.
*  No hobbies?
*  No hobbies.
*  Nothing?
*  I don't collect things.
*  Wow.
*  I own very little.
*  I never have owned much.
*  I wish I had 100 lives to live simultaneously.
*  I would do 100 different things.
*  This is the difference.
*  You're insatiable in that way.
*  You get a thing and you're going to nail it to the wall, man.
*  You're going to nail it.
*  My late great friend Anthony Bourdain, his bio on Twitter, it said enthusiast.
*  I really wish that I'd come up with that because that's what I am.
*  I'm an enthusiast.
*  I wouldn't say it now because I'd rip him off.
*  And also now my bio says dragon believer.
*  And congratulations on that.
*  Thank you.
*  The ladies of the view.
*  They said I believe in dragons.
*  She triple checked.
*  She's great.
*  Triple check, Mike.
*  Got to be true.
*  But I'm an enthusiast.
*  That's what I am.
*  I am a person who is very fortunate and that I have a love of a lot of things.
*  Well, you and Tony were similar, obviously in that way.
*  He took big bites.
*  He took big swings.
*  We became good friends when he really got into jujitsu.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I kind of got him into it.
*  And then his wife really got him into it.
*  But he started going to the UFC.
*  His wife was training in jujitsu.
*  And she got really into it.
*  She was really loving it.
*  And then she was like, let's go to the UFC.
*  He's like, this is fucking great.
*  And then he came to one of my comedy shows.
*  We became friends.
*  Started going to dinner, by the way, with Anthony Bourdain.
*  It's the coolest fucking thing in the world.
*  It's got to be.
*  Because you go to dinner with him and all the chefs freak out.
*  And so they just want to feed you.
*  They just want to like, don't touch the menu.
*  We got you.
*  And they come over and bring food.
*  And you know.
*  I wrote a eulogy for him that crashed my website.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It's really funny.
*  I only met him twice.
*  And each time it was fairly brief.
*  But there was a time when he was doing no reservations.
*  Dirty Jobs was early on.
*  I bet you Fear Factor was still in production then too.
*  Yeah.
*  Fear Factor was maybe.
*  Fear Factor stopped in 2007.
*  And No Reservations I think was around that time.
*  Yeah.
*  He was on in six.
*  For sure.
*  Dirty Jobs went on in 03.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the CNN show.
*  Which was I think like CNN's highlight of their time.
*  And I think he really changed that network.
*  Because all of a sudden that network was this fucking cool show.
*  Where this guy had this brilliant narration.
*  And he had this wanderlust.
*  But also with this like real fascination with people.
*  And cultures.
*  And just really loved it.
*  He just loved going to Vietnam.
*  He loved going wherever he could go.
*  He loved to eat their street food.
*  He loved to talk to them.
*  He really wanted to know what these people were all about.
*  I've never.
*  This will sound vainglorious.
*  And I don't mean it to.
*  But with the possible exception of me on Discovery in 2010.
*  Narrating half their shows and hosting Dirty Jobs.
*  Which was a thing.
*  I felt really triangulated then.
*  But then when I met Tony.
*  And I had a show on CNN at the same time.
*  Actually it was a companion show.
*  What was your show?
*  It was called Somebody's Gotta Do It.
*  Oh that's right.
*  That's right.
*  It followed Dirty Jobs.
*  And Jeff Zucker wanted something with Tony.
*  So he was like well let's kind of do a version of this.
*  And I said yeah okay.
*  But all the trouble in the world man.
*  Every crisis whether it's Haiti or whether it's a riot.
*  The show got preempted constantly.
*  They didn't preempt Tony but they preempted me a lot.
*  And I was commiserating with Tony about this once.
*  And that's when we had the conversation where I said look.
*  I just gotta tell you man.
*  I have never in my life seen anybody doing the right show for them.
*  At the right time.
*  On the right network for them.
*  I've never seen that like that before.
*  And never mind the award.
*  It was the Peabody's that got me actually.
*  I don't know who cares about the Emmys.
*  They're easy.
*  But jeez it was just one Peabody award after the next.
*  And it wasn't a huge...
*  The audience wasn't as big as people think but they were engaged.
*  Well that's what's important.
*  I mean the audience if they're really there for you rather than if they're just flipping channels.
*  Because there's a lot of shows that just get people that are flipping channels.
*  When I was on news radio everybody wanted the spot after Seinfeld.
*  Because there was Seinfeld and Friends were on the same night.
*  And it was just this murderous Thursday night lineup.
*  It was an unbelievable lineup.
*  And if you got lucky you were Sex and the City or the Single Guy.
*  And what Paul Sims the producer of news radio would call a shit sandwich.
*  Because you had your brilliant show and then your terrible show.
*  And then another brilliant show and another terrible show.
*  But if you got in those time spots oh boy you got a good spot.
*  Because people are going to just keep tuning in.
*  They didn't tune in for news radio.
*  News radio wasn't really successful after it was off the air.
*  You were in the slipstream.
*  Yeah.
*  You were in the orbit.
*  Well we weren't owned by NBC.
*  So it was a different production company.
*  It was Pearlstein Gray.
*  So they didn't have a vested interest in us being successful.
*  So the writers would show up.
*  My friend Lou would wear a t-shirt and he would write the number that we were.
*  When we would do the table reads.
*  And one day it was 88.
*  And I was like for real?
*  He's like yeah.
*  I was like oh no.
*  With a bullet.
*  We thought we were going to get canceled literally every year except the year we got canceled.
*  The year we got canceled I was shocked.
*  Because that was like the year after Phil died.
*  And then John Lovitz took his place for a season.
*  And then they canceled it after that.
*  And like the perfect thing for our show.
*  We never even hit the 100 episodes for syndication.
*  They had to sell it at like 98 episodes.
*  That was like our show.
*  It's like we were always like barely hanging on.
*  It was a funny show.
*  It was a really good show with talented people.
*  I love that show.
*  The people I was super lucky to work on.
*  And it ruined me because I could never work on another show after that.
*  What was the big lesson from News Radio if there was one for you?
*  Well it was just fortune.
*  The lesson is that you could just be fortunate.
*  You know because I was not a trained actor at all.
*  I did a set on MTV.
*  Half Hour Comedy Hour.
*  They had this comedy show.
*  I did a set and then MTV offered me a development deal.
*  And then my manager said this is terrible money.
*  They're going to lock you up for like three years for like $500.
*  It was crazy.
*  Ridiculous bad money.
*  He said I'm going to take your tape and tell all these other production companies
*  that MTV wants to sign a deal with you and it'll start a bidding war.
*  And he was brilliant.
*  And he did it and that's exactly what happened.
*  And the next thing you know I couldn't answer my phone because my phone was just calling.
*  Agents and people would just call me.
*  Some guy called me from Universal.
*  I was like what?
*  What the fuck is going on in this shitty apartment on my way out the door to play pool.
*  And this guy is telling me he wants me to get on a flight that night.
*  We have a flight at 10 p.m.
*  Leaving out of LaGuardia.
*  I was like what are you talking about?
*  And so then I call my manager.
*  This guy just fucking call me from you.
*  He goes don't answer your phone.
*  He's like go play pool.
*  Get out of here.
*  I'll take care of it.
*  Next thing you know I was in Hollywood.
*  It was like that quick.
*  And I was on a show called Hardball.
*  It went six episodes.
*  And the only reason why I stayed in California I wanted to go back to New York.
*  I hated it.
*  I hated actors.
*  I just couldn't deal with being around these weirdos.
*  They were these weird phony people.
*  They would say good to see you because they couldn't remember if they met you.
*  So instead of saying nice to meet you and fucking up.
*  I go I'm sorry I met you.
*  I'm sorry I fucked up.
*  They didn't want to be real.
*  So everyone said good to see you.
*  Good to see you.
*  Everyone was good.
*  And it was super unsincere.
*  I was like this is so weird.
*  It was a super uncomfortable experience.
*  And it was the worst experience on a show because the people that ran the show,
*  Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran, super funny talented guys who had worked on Married with
*  Children and The Simpsons.
*  Brilliant.
*  But the studio didn't think that they were good enough to run a show.
*  So they brought in this hack.
*  And this guy comes in and just butchers all the scripts.
*  It was horrible.
*  So that gets canceled.
*  The only reason why I stayed is because I had a lease.
*  So I got a nice apartment.
*  I'm like the first apartment I ever had.
*  I was like I thought I was going to be on TV forever.
*  Like this is going to be easy.
*  And now fuck I got to get out of here.
*  I was like wanted to go back to New York.
*  I thought about breaking my lease.
*  But then NBC contacted me and they said we have the show.
*  It's called News Radio and we're recasting one of the one of the roles.
*  Do you want to come in?
*  So I came in and auditioned for it.
*  And the next thing you know I'm working with Phil Hartman.
*  It was bizarre.
*  No aspirations whatsoever to be an actor.
*  Never wanted to be on TV.
*  And then I'm working with Andy Dick and Phil Hartman and Maura Tierney and Candy Alexander,
*  Vicki Lewis and Dave Foley.
*  Like this is crazy.
*  From the kids from Second City.
*  Yeah he was brilliant.
*  Dave Foley by the way was the secret producer of News Radio because he would they would give
*  him full autonomy.
*  So he would completely rewrite scenes like on the spot.
*  Come up with punch lines for everybody.
*  We all did that for everybody.
*  Like we would all come up like maybe you should say this maybe you should say that.
*  It was like super collaborative.
*  So just fortune.
*  Complete utter good fortune because I had friends that were on terrible sitcoms and
*  they were living in hell.
*  And we'd hang out at the comedy store and you know they were living in hell.
*  And I was like look I'm going to show that nobody watches but it's fun as shit.
*  And I can't believe I'm on TV.
*  This is nuts.
*  Yeah you're in on the joke.
*  Yeah it was fun.
*  It was really fun.
*  But it was just fortunate.
*  I could have easily never never done any of those things easily.
*  I thought for years that really a sitcom had to be the best gig in the world to have to
*  do a basically to do a play every week.
*  If it's a good sitcom.
*  If it's a good set if it's a bad sitcom it's hell.
*  Sure those guys do a lot of coke and buy nice cars.
*  Those are all they're on bad shows.
*  They just want to give themselves something to reward themselves for this fucking slave
*  not I wouldn't say slave work.
*  I should say like you're a slave to money.
*  It's not you're you're compromising who you are for money.
*  You don't really want to do that show but you're on it and it sucks and you have to
*  repeat these terrible lines.
*  That's what I'm getting at.
*  For me it came down to that.
*  I finally got a chance to do one.
*  I played Tim Allen's younger brother.
*  Last Man Standing for a turn.
*  I never saw that show.
*  That was a weird one right because they got mad at him because he was right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so crazy didn't they cancel it.
*  It was their number one show and they canceled then Fox picked it up.
*  That's so nuts they canceled it because they didn't like his politics.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  That mean that's that basically happened to Dirty Jobs too.
*  Really.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah it's it was mind boggling but the point was I finally got a chance to.
*  I don't want to gloss over that I want to come back to that.
*  All right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Now that's a great one.
*  You'll love this but Tim is great by the way and we became friends and chemistry on camera.
*  Everybody loved it and when it was over I was like well you know do an honest inventory Mike.
*  What did you love?
*  What didn't you love?
*  And really the only thing I loved was seeing people who loved each other and being welcomed
*  into their little world.
*  Yeah the clan.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the idea that somebody else is writing lines for me I know that sounds impossibly
*  arrogant but I was so used to nobody writes for me.
*  Dirty Jobs is truly unscripted.
*  Everything I ever did there were never any lines.
*  And also that's an alien experience for you.
*  Yeah I mean I've done plenty of plays as a kid and stuff but that's different.
*  You know that's a that's different.
*  Once you're in Hollywood and once you're sort of in the machine it still lingers.
*  I mean that's the whole reason I crashed the audition for the opera.
*  I was just trying to find a sitcom at some point somewhere and then when I finally got it
*  you know I realized just how lucky I'd been prior to that and how here you want this and how crap
*  man you know a thing can live in your mind so much bigger than it is in reality.
*  So while I love doing it for that week I said to my business partner over it that
*  this thing that I used to think of as the single most efficient way to make a living
*  was so wildly inefficient.
*  It takes four days to rehearse for a half hour thing.
*  You got to be kidding me.
*  I could do five one hour shows in the same period.
*  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah completely different experience in that way.
*  It's a collaborative fun time and you do become like a little bit of a strange family.
*  We all hung out together and drunk together.
*  And that's important.
*  Yeah oh yeah yeah it is important.
*  It was like we you know it was a lot of fun man you know and meeting people like Steven
*  Root who you know went on to do a million different things.
*  Brilliant brilliant guy.
*  You get to see people that are like really good at like he was a character.
*  He was the only one of us that wasn't really himself.
*  Like he was this one guy who was like a super sweet guy when you meet him in real life
*  and then he was Jimmy James.
*  My stapler.
*  Yeah he becomes.
*  Did you see what was that one Cohen Brothers had some Netflix thing.
*  A Wild West Netflix thing.
*  He played on that.
*  He was fucking genius.
*  Wasn't he in Oh Brother?
*  Yeah he was in I think he was in Oh Brother.
*  He's been in everything.
*  He's in a million different things.
*  But just being with these people that you know like I said I had no aspirations to act.
*  I just wanted I was just a comic.
*  I just wanted to make a living doing comedy and then somebody offered me
*  more money than I made in a year for a week.
*  And I was like this is crazy.
*  And then all of a sudden I'm on a show.
*  It was like just fortune.
*  I auditioned for two shows ever and I got both of them.
*  Those are the only two shows I ever auditioned for.
*  What was the other one?
*  Hardball the first one that I went for that was terrible.
*  Yeah that was the baseball show that got canceled and then I auditioned for news radio.
*  So it was it was nuts.
*  It was just I was just stepping in shit every step of the way.
*  That's hysterical.
*  Didn't make any sense.
*  So I never had an agent except for a very brief period when I did.
*  And it was you know Sean Perry over at Endeavor.
*  You guys ever cross paths?
*  I know his former assistant turned out to be his wife later.
*  How's that work?
*  Nicole Taylor.
*  That's man they're they're living great.
*  They live up in the hills somewhere.
*  He has a how's it work with your former assistant?
*  I don't do that.
*  How's that work?
*  That's none of my business.
*  That's a dangerous undertaking.
*  She called me one day and I was in my in my full on freelance world.
*  I hadn't had a job since since QVC.
*  So this is like 1999 and she says I just want to I just want to send you out for for something
*  because I know you're going to book it.
*  And I said well actually I yeah I could use a gig.
*  So she sends me out in the same week she says you should read for Craig Plygian over at
*  Pilgrim Films.
*  He's doing something called Worst Case Scenario and he's looking for a host.
*  And so I auditioned for that and then later that week she says this guy from
*  Nashville Michael Orkin was his name who I had worked with years earlier not Nashville Memphis.
*  He was hosting the EP on that evening magazine thing that I mentioned and he's ready to hire
*  you based off your blooper tape.
*  I never had a tape either.
*  I just my whole audition reel in those days was a compilation of every moment that went off the
*  rails at QVC.
*  All the things that led to my eventual firings as well as the cat sack and all the other crap.
*  I dare you to hire me.
*  I got hired for both jobs that week both jobs.
*  And so suddenly I'm working for TBS hosting Worst Case Scenario which lived up to its name.
*  And then I'm up in San Francisco hosting evening magazine.
*  And there was no conflict of interest.
*  Oh no.
*  Like you know totally negotiated both of them at the same time.
*  Wow that's cool.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Nicole switched agencies and I never really had an agent you know prior to that.
*  That's fortunate.
*  Or since super fortunate.
*  Financially it's great.
*  You know what's fortunate man.
*  Remember okay so my mother calls me I'm at evening magazine sitting in my cubicle.
*  My dad my granddad's 90 years old.
*  Remember this.
*  I didn't I didn't close the loop on this.
*  But that's to answer your first question.
*  What happened was my mom called me and said your grandfather is going to be 90 tomorrow.
*  And before he dies wouldn't it be great if he could turn on the TV and see you
*  doing something that looked like work.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  My mother's a savage.
*  She just finished her fourth book by the way.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah she's written three bestsellers after 80.
*  That's incredible.
*  She's out of control.
*  That's incredible.
*  So she was like she wanted you to do something impressive.
*  My mother wrote every day for 60 years.
*  Wow.
*  No agent no got published in like the news American and the Baltimore Sun.
*  You know local stuff some horse magazines.
*  We were horse people kind of growing up and her dream was to write.
*  She finally got a book deal when she was 80.
*  Went to a number four bestseller.
*  Wow.
*  And everything she's written so far.
*  So that's recently back in whatever it was 2001 she was just a pain in my ass.
*  And she called me to say you know wouldn't it be great if your granddad this guy whose
*  shadow I grew up in you know could see you doing something because like my pop it's he'd seen the
*  opera he'd seen QVC he'd seen every godforsaken infomercial he'd seen you know I'd done a lot
*  of things probably 200 jobs in the whole freelance world.
*  And so I was 42 and I took my cameraman from Evening Magazine into the sewer of San Francisco
*  the next day to host the show from a sewer.
*  And what happened in the sewer job was I mean it changed it's I wrote a book about it.
*  It changed my whole life.
*  The roaches are the size of your thumbs there are millions of them and they crawl all over you.
*  The shit comes at you in a chocolate tide of unending disappointment and it's filled not
*  just with all the stuff that comes out of your body it's filled with stuff that comes out of your
*  medicine cabinet plastic products and rubber private condoms stuck to your rubber suit.
*  You know it's unspeakably vile you can barely breathe.
*  And what and what happened to me down there is I completely failed to like host the show.
*  All the standups went wrong laterals exploded with my kids we were all getting hit in the head.
*  It's like a shooting gallery there was a rat the size of a loaf of bread that crawled up my
*  I lost my footing fell into I was I was baptized.
*  I was baptized in a river of crap.
*  And at the end my cameraman throw up at one point an enormous puke and I'm I'm squatting in the
*  filth you know looking at the camera trying to open the show and when you see when you see your
*  cameraman's vomit float past you as you're trying to articulate a thought.
*  And meanwhile the guy who was like my minder was an actual sewer inspector and he's in the background
*  trying to do his job which is to hammer out the old bricks that are rotting and replace them with
*  new ones now it's 105 degrees it's the seventh level of hell.
*  It's clear I can't do my job so I go over to this guy his name was Gene Cruz and I say hey
*  what are you doing? He's like I'm putting bricks in I said you need a hand.
*  So I start mixing the mortar and we start talking just like people you know not like a hosty thing
*  like what you were saying just what would happen if you had an honest conversation totally unscripted
*  with a guy who didn't really know he was going to be on camera but what if you film it and put it
*  on tv anyway what would happen? Well what happened a week later when this thing finally aired was
*  I was fired because people sitting down to hear their heart tugging story of the three-legged
*  dog up in Marin overcoming canine kidney failure and it's me the smart ass 42 year old crawling
*  through a river of crap. I mean they're trying to eat their meatloaf you know it was the wrong
*  segment for that for that show but talk about fortunate the mail that came in as a result
*  some people said it was funny and they liked it some people were repulsed but the letters
*  that changed my life were the ones that said you think that was dirty?
*  Wait do you see what my brother does? Wait do you see what my cousin does? My mom my sister my uncle
*  right and I'm like oh my god there's I mean if if the bay area is any kind of a microcosm
*  for the country and I'm not saying it is but from a tv standpoint I was like this is new
*  no I've never seen feedback like this I've never seen curiosity among the viewership like this
*  and so that's that's where the idea came from I was like what what if the viewer programs the show
*  a and what if b the host of the show is the person that I meet who welcomes me into their
*  shithole or wherever they work and what if what if I'm not a host after all after 20 years of
*  impersonating a host what if I'm a guest or an apprentice or a or an avatar or a cipher right
*  like like what if I just think of myself differently than this guy who hits the mark and looks at the
*  camera and tells you the cat sack is 29 I mean right right right what if you just let all that go
*  well and uh you know I don't know that I would have thought of it like that at at 20 at 22
*  certainly not not even at 32 but at 42 I was entering a more introspective kind of phase
*  and so I was really just curious to see what would happen if I if I thought of myself as something
*  different well if we think about the history of just media it's it's very recent right you have
*  radio which is like when when did people start listening to radio was the 1800s okay and then
*  you have television that kicks on in the 50s and everyone's a presenter ladies and gentlemen
*  the Beatles right everyone's Ed Sullivan everyone's Jack car Jack Parr like there's these
*  type of people that do this job it's like you ever go to you ever do a morning radio show
*  oh I'm sure you have morning DJ voice hey five o'clock on the hour let's go with Bon Jovi there's
*  a voice that they have a strip club DJ similar there's a voice anchorman anchorman but now yes
*  the news especially local news they have a very specific thing that they're doing it's cadence
*  yeah well it's fake it's not a person there's no people act like that if you had a guy like
*  that over your house for dinner you'd be like what the fuck is wrong with Bob Bob's a psycho
*  the guy's got people buried in his fucking basement who talks like that right and so I think
*  the internet opened up a lot of room for unprofessional people to thrive that's me
*  so like I'm I can't do that you're not unprofessional but it's like I mean
*  in that regard like I'm not so I wasn't trying to do something that had already existed I was just
*  doing like I was doing like a guest on Opie and Anthony show that's what it was like like when
*  you're a guest on Opie and Anthony that's how you talk everybody would just hang out and talk that's
*  a fun show it was anyway that opened my eyes up to podcasting and then you know Anthony Kumia had
*  his own show that he did in his basement live at the compound where he'd sing karaoke holding
*  a machine gun that fucking maniac and then the other big one was doing a Tom Green show because
*  Tom Green had his own sort of internet talk show that he did out of his house sure I remember that
*  yeah that was huge so that also helped too and I actually was in negotiation with the people that
*  were doing his show and I was thinking about doing something my own but then I was like
*  I can't work with anybody I gotta do this on my own quick sidebar I don't know if this is of
*  interest and Jamie forgive me because I don't know if I'm supposed to ask you to do things but I sold
*  the first karaoke machine ever in this country yeah on QVC yeah oh let's see that it's out there
*  it's out I'm not proud of it you should be proud of that but it was that's a statistic it was like
*  12 15 in the morning you know and they they sent me one of these things to my apartment
*  and I'm like what what is this is this even like look they're everywhere now obviously we we've
*  gone through the crazy though that you're like the godfather of karaoke well I'm among them
*  so what year is this what are we talking look at you 91 92 wow
*  yeah
*  99.95 yeah yeah it's hard to see it's so blurry isn't it interesting like how bad television looked
*  back then in comparison now like just the resolution yeah but you know what there's something
*  um there's something more trustworthy about rudimentary production value right you can't
*  like yeah I was talking to your guy Bruce about this earlier um he was saying how much he loves
*  like an antique road show and this old house you know and I said I love this old house I still I
*  I was on this old house were you yeah man they invited me on they wanted to raise money
*  for the to reinvigorate the trades they had a very similar cause as I do today and um and they got
*  all these advertisers lined up and then and then the guy in charge said well Mike's doing the same
*  basic thing let's call him and maybe we should just give him the money and let his foundation
*  give it away it'll be simpler than starting a new thing and they called and I said yeah I'll do that
*  sure but I'd like to be on your show and they like that'd be great so they invited me on and
*  it was awesome but my point is part of the charm of those shows is the almost remedial
*  simplicity of the production it's it's old it's like there's an entrance right there's an exit
*  right there what's the last time you saw it dissolve right right like all that stuff and
*  and I used to make fun of it I used to make fun of QVC I still do but but in reality man that
*  there was something strangely comforting about that kind of production value and everything I
*  learned that turned out to be useful you know I learned in the middle of the night so there's a
*  thing about something that's overproduced that kind of dissolves some of its authenticity because
*  there's too much thought put into each and every shot everything about there's too much coordination
*  it's almost like you lose a comfort like I'm I might be entertained by it it might be fascinating
*  like like keeping up with the Kardashians you ever notice like they change scenes every five
*  seconds just like keep you like yeah yeah keep it tuned in there's something smart about that
*  because it does keep you engaged but it doesn't feel as authentic as if it was just like one
*  person following them around in real time with no edits at all just one camera on them here's
*  a thesis at least in the world of non-fiction this doesn't apply to scripted but production
*  is by definition the enemy of authenticity right it's the enemy of it you need it in order to have
*  a finished product but when you get in your own way then you get in the viewer's way right and
*  one of the one of the things that kept dirty jobs on the air for 20 years early on I kind of realized
*  that and and I wasn't sure what to do about it but I thought maybe maybe we need to think of the show
*  like a documentary so we got a behind the scenes camera that never stopped rolling and so if my
*  if my mic pack went out or if a plane flew over or if somebody screwed something up or if we have to
*  stop for whatever reason I always knew there was a truth cam that's what I called it and I could
*  always look to it and I could say all right well what happened here blah blah blah and so it was
*  those moments where I think the viewer realized oh oh he's not he's not trying to sell me anything
*  at least not here you know he's letting us see the sausage yeah and that was new in in non-fiction
*  you know that was a whole new way to think about authenticity Vivek Ramaswamy was the only
*  candidate I invited onto my podcast because he I read somewhere that he said if he was nominated
*  he vowed to never use a teleprompter to deliver a speech well he could pull it off I whether you can
*  pull it off or not I just thought that was so interesting and I and I wanted to talk to him
*  about that specifically and then it's funny a year later you know I think I think the teleprompter
*  is probably the best example of one forced error after the next like when you when you think about
*  the anchor who just wants to be believed the spokesman who just wants to be seen as credible
*  the politician who just wants to be just wants it just so it's like they they want to be authentic
*  and yet they do the single most inauthentic thing you can possibly do which is pretend to not read
*  a thing that everyone can see you're reading right and so like the cognitive dissonance is rich
*  you know and I just think we've entered into this world where like the the least persuasive thing you
*  can do is say trust me or take it from me you know people have just been burned so much right
*  that they're gonna need we need a truth cam we need it in the newsroom not just in a sewer
*  I mean it worked there but we need it everywhere fuck it we'll do it live bill o'reilly of all people
*  I'll go live that's the real bill yeah that's it's the real bill that's it yeah that's what's
*  interesting about um social media and social media like it's there's this giant resistance right now
*  to the idea that x is the new source of the world mainstream it is they're the mainstream it's the
*  new source of the world you and these people that want to cling to authority and say no you're not
*  you're god damn it you're not the fucking you're not a journalist you know this you guys
*  fucked us too many times yeah and we don't believe you anymore and so the only way for us to find out
*  what's real and what's not real is someone posts it online and then everybody looks at it and then
*  you get the community notes and that's way better than the new york times telling me that the fruit
*  loops in canada are exactly the same as the fruit loops in america except for a bunch of shit that's
*  banned and that's the whole point of the whole fucking thing but meanwhile they're fact checking
*  rfk junior so now i don't trust you anymore either you can't um so it's like that's what's going on
*  you can't gloss over the community notes you can't that's it it's it that that's the truth cam
*  that's the solution on twitter it's the solution to this thing that we're trying to figure out how
*  do we know what's true what's not true you get a consensus there's enough people that actually can
*  read scientific papers there's enough people that know the the field that's being discussed or you're
*  going to get out of the hundreds of millions of people on x you're going to get an expert who's
*  going to say this is why this is incorrect and this is how you're supposed to read it and then
*  everybody goes oh okay this is wrong and now you know and if you can just do a little research and
*  go through that paper or go through that thread you'll you'll if you're an objective person you'll
*  probably get a good sense of who's right and who's wrong it's a weird dichotomy though right like
*  skepticism like we have to be skeptical yes but part of the reason we have to be as skeptical as
*  we are is because so much of the media has abdicated on skepticism and they've become
*  something else you know something else and so you know you can't you can't really blame people
*  for you know considering what we used to dismiss as a conspiracy theory
*  when the theories start to get born out and when there's such a level of eroded trust in in once
*  credible institutions like well that's also the whole reason for the disdain for conspiracy
*  theorists in the first place is that no you're not an expert i'm the expert and you're wrong
*  but then when they're wrong there's no repercussions they never want to say you know we were wrong about
*  all this yeah we're sorry we were wrong about masking we were wrong about social distancing
*  we're wrong about all of it where's the where's the humility man yeah no humility because because
*  they're not humans and that's why you don't believe them because you know they're just people reading
*  off bullshit off a teleprompter that's it that's it that's all it is and nobody wants that anymore
*  you don't have to have that anymore and that's why x has emerged and sub stack and all these
*  different things it's like the place where people go to get actual information and that's why they
*  like podcasts because it's just the three of us in this room that's it the whoever is the numbers
*  of people and carl carl's out cold now but the numbers of people that are listening it's like
*  it's just this crazy number that are all just listening to three people so there's no producer
*  there's no all that shit that gets in the way of things has been removed it's actually for people
*  when you think about it that way like if the audience becomes its own amalgam i think of it
*  like that you know i i think the audience gets short-shifted a lot you know i thought of it last
*  night in your club it's like the audience is i mean without the audience what are you doing
*  you know you're just building certainly at a club yeah at a club it's everything it's everything
*  but why is it different well because you can't think about it that way because the best way to
*  do it in my opinion the best for me the best way i've found to do it is to never think about the
*  audience all i'm interested in i think about it in terms of like if i'm bored they must be bored
*  like let me pick this up a little bit let me move this around a little bit let me figure out a way
*  to you got to move a conversation like sometimes i've talked to like very old scholars like very
*  old in this like time sometimes like okay right we got to focus here like we're gonna get you on
*  this like we're gonna land this with trump a little bit in the beginning when he was telling
*  me the story with lincoln's bedroom i was at the bed was he was a long man he was at very tall very
*  tall so i was like okay we got to figure out a way to what's it like to be the fucking president
*  what does that feel i'm like how crazy is it on the first day that's what i really wanted to know
*  so it's like you got to kind of move people around but that is for me like as an audience member i'm
*  not thinking about the audience because i feel like the best way to do it is for me to actually
*  100 be engaged and interested in what this person is talking about but don't you think
*  that that's you you are the proxy for the audience when you're at your best yeah for sure in my view
*  yes when i'm listening to you when i like high five you virtually it's when you asked the question
*  i was thinking and i really tried to do that in the sewer i really tried to do that on dirty jobs
*  i really tried i think you did i think that's why it resonated so much with people well i hope so
*  but for sure because you didn't ever seem like a fake guy doing a thing you seem like a fun guy
*  a regular guy who's doing this thing where you're interacting with you like what how do you do this
*  like what is this so yes thanks but then all of a sudden i look up and donald trump's in the sewer
*  with me oh shit and there's an election in a week oh the stakes around me right all of a sudden have
*  changed so it's so interesting that he was sitting right where i'm sitting and you feel the need to
*  kind of put some sides on this thing because you understand first and foremost that as an audience
*  member right as somebody who's just listening to this as a fly on the wall i'm getting a little
*  lost yeah i'm a little bored let's move it along yeah right right so i mean you can say that hey
*  that's joe being a good host or that's joe being super honest in a conversation where he's starting
*  to drift a little bit i'm most certainly aware that people are going to listen to it don't get
*  me wrong but i don't think like the questions like maybe the audience would want to know this
*  i do do this one thing even if i know that some i know how this a thing works i will ask a person
*  how a thing works so the audience can hear it from them rather than from me i don't want to be mr
*  smarty pants sure i don't have to be but that's one thing that i do where i'm aware that people
*  probably don't know what we're talking about so let's like could you explain where this came from
*  or why this because sometimes people especially if they have an area of expertise they just assume
*  that people know what they're talking about when they're talking about specific techniques or ways
*  they do things so that in that way i do think about the audience but most of the time that's
*  just like i'm just doing my job but mostly all i'm trying to do is be 100 locked in yeah just lock
*  and i feel like if i'm locked in and i'm just real honest and just try to like be really curious
*  and really just try to get the most out of this person that's going to be good for the audience
*  what was more consequential him coming on or her not coming on him coming on why do you say that
*  well because realistically like okay my thought about her coming on was i would just i was going
*  to be very nice i was i want to have fun with her i wanted to just be able to talk to her and ask her
*  questions i want to get a sense of her as a human being and if it's policy talk that bothered them
*  like there was a few things they didn't want to talk marijuana legalization they initially didn't
*  want to talk about internet censorship and then they changed their tune and then they wanted to
*  talk about internet censorship almost great internet censorship is important let's talk about it
*  but whatever she wanted to talk about fucking riding bikes i don't give a shit i don't give a
*  fuck what you want to talk about i want to talk about cooking rock climbing i just want to just
*  get a sense of her as a human being that's just as a human being what is it like like does it
*  freak you out and people get mad at you is it freaky out when you fuck up a sentence and you
*  ramble and you know i know what it's like you know when you don't you know the people are listening
*  and you're like i gotta fucking bring this home and i don't know how to and just sort of repeat
*  these key lines or this maybe there's some new word you become enamored with you know you realize
*  when you realize you're in the middle of a sentence with with no obvious ending yes that's a that's
*  qvc in a nutshell okay that's what it is right and when the teleprompter breaks yeah that's when you
*  get to know the person right and so and so that's why i'm asking i i don't i wonder you know i mean i
*  i listened to the interview and and and i asked myself well is anybody going to vote differently
*  as a result i don't think so are some people going to vote who otherwise might not have voted
*  maybe but for me when you started to talk very casually about the fact that that that that her
*  campaign had stipulations they had i think there was a lot of that that were she had made some a
*  bunch of blunders and there was a lot of concern that she was going to make blunders here this is
*  what i was going to get to she might have it might have been a mess yeah i might have asked her about
*  immigration we might have had a conversation about like what is the goal like why why hasn't this
*  been this doesn't if we can you know launch rockets and land them at the same time as we
*  can't control border that seems not real that doesn't seem real one seems way harder and that's
*  happening he's fucking catching rockets with robot arms yeah okay if that's happening how come this
*  can't be fixed because this didn't used to be like this so why is it like this now why does the
*  red cross have these stations set up where they're giving people maps and instructions why does china
*  have these places in mexico where they only have chinese menus chinese writing chinese everything
*  and these people are coming from china specifically to the spot and then making it across the country
*  what's the purpose of this has anybody ever examined what these people are up to why they're
*  doing this how is it so organized like what is that about maybe that would have been a disaster
*  because that that's something that i felt like if if she didn't want to talk about the marijuana
*  and didn't want to talk about internet censorship immigration is an interesting one right yeah it's
*  very interesting because like first of all i am pro immigration i am the grandson of immigrants
*  my grandparents came over here during the depression if they didn't do it i wouldn't be here
*  the entire country other than the native americans are immigrants that's all of us every is we are a
*  country of immigrants so we should have some stipulations though about who gets in and how
*  you get in and where you're coming from and what do you what is your past like are you a murderer
*  are you a gang banger have you been selling fentanyl for the last 20 years like what are you
*  doing with your life bob inquiring minds want to know we want to know i think that's reasonable
*  do you see a difference between an immigrant and a settler well it all is the timeline right
*  it's a timeline thing yeah not only that you're an invader like if you're one of those people that
*  comes over in 1820 and you're making your way across the plains and you encounter the comanche
*  you're the piece of shit you're not supposed to be there that's where they live you're in their yard
*  you're some fucking weird scruffy american looking for gold right you know what are you doing here
*  bro you're the problem you know and now all of a sudden that's texas right that's where we are we
*  live here now this is my land right this is where i live right right i got this now well
*  it's weird we're all invaders in one at one point in time every human being that's a nomadic person
*  that's made their way across the country you've probably entered a place where people were before
*  every freedom fighter is a terrorist yes right it depends on who wins history gets to decide all
*  that sure if we didn't actually if the founding fathers didn't pull it off you know we would be
*  these wild renegade english people that decided to come over here and just fucking create havoc
*  so yeah man there are a lot of ways to go with all this but i'll just come back to the teleprompter
*  and say if that's an essential part of how you communicate and if that's an accent if that's
*  part of your image right you know then you you can't be on this show right right right you you
*  can't you you you can't join me in the sewer right right there's that there's no room for
*  the contrivance there's just no room there's just no time i just wonder if that's what they make them
*  do like if you make me do that i'll suck too you know i can't read off a teleprompter yeah but i'm
*  not interested in doing that it's not my thing but if you make a person do that like if if you're
*  going to be a politician right okay and you were a senator and which is you know you don't get that
*  kind of exposure that you get if you're a vice president or you're running for president initially
*  right like that's a totally different scene and there's probably a bunch of people that coach you
*  how to do it right and you don't know what the fuck you're doing and if you're not a powerful
*  person like a big personality like donald trump who could just do it but also coming from a world of
*  entertainment for most of his life he's been in the public eye and hosting the apprentice for 14
*  years like he's he's used to being in front of the camera it's a normal experience for him he has
*  a massive advantage that's what i meant by production becomes the enemy of authenticity
*  yes when you rely upon it to the point where you can't function in the midst or in the wake of a
*  glitch well in a world of glitches you're in trouble right you know and i and i think the
*  audience not just yours but the country i just think they're just exhausted by by people who
*  have been managed and focus grouped and weighed and measured and tested and then put out there
*  i think it's also the evolution of culture in general because if you just go back to we're
*  talking about media you go back and watch a film from 1950 versus a film from 2024 the way people
*  communicate now is much more realistic there was a way of talking like hannah what did you do
*  you know there was a weird performative aspect to it because they didn't know how to do it right
*  in sitcoms too in everything father knows best yes all that stuff all that stuff and then as time
*  moved on it changed like all in the family was all of a sudden this realistic portrayal of an
*  of a family where you got a racist dad and the son is uh you know the the meathead the son-in-law
*  and the the daughter's a hippie and the the mom just can't feel what are you doing what do you do
*  it was a fucking amazing show oh watchy it was an amazing show you had sanford and son sanford
*  and son is another one you know it was a comedy but people talked like people would talk in real
*  life and then as culture moves on songs change books change everything sort of like moves into
*  the there's a much greater understanding if you had a show and you try to do a father knows best
*  today it would almost be like you were putting on like a parody like you would it would be weird
*  you would be it would be like a weird tim and eric type thing like you're doing something weird
*  on purpose right right and that's not acceptable anymore so the culture has moved on so for sure
*  but it moves on and fits and starts and it's not a line right it's no no yeah yeah yeah just like
*  the climate right right so like the even the look the changes in podcasting like it's happening
*  right now right in front of us you can see so many different types of podcasts yeah see so many
*  different kinds of uh scripted dramas i mean oh my god yeah can you imagine breaking bad right right
*  30 years ago right right right it's impossible right a whole lot of things had to happen in front
*  of that for for that thing to the sopranos had happened that's right and something had happened
*  before that yeah well in my world and in the world you're describing that was the age of
*  authority that's when eric severide could talk to you like this that's when yeah like like discovery
*  is a is a good example you asked about it and i'll i'll tell you first of all john hendrix a
*  friend of mine who created that channel you would love he did this in his garage basically i mean the
*  story's incredible how he talked malone into getting some transponder space or maybe his
*  westinghouse and and let mortgage his house to buy some documentaries from australia and started
*  beaming all that stuff down i asked him years ago i'm like what was the like what was the guiding
*  principle behind this this business model and of course you know discovery has since purchased
*  warner brothers you know they're the biggest entertainment company in the world today
*  and it started with john hendrix saying one goal to satisfy curiosity that's it
*  everything every everything i do must line up with a traditional definition of what a discovery is
*  it's the it's the satisfying of curiosity yeah and so when i pitched dirty jobs i was coming in
*  on the heels of what you're talking about there was still in non-fiction it was richard attenborough
*  it was jacques stowe it was jane goodall it was you know the discovery brand was very much a reflection
*  of some of the the greatest naturalists and historians and you know astrophysicists in the
*  world they they deferred to experts and then they hired guys like me to narrate shows and we could
*  sound even more official and so you you had this dance this production dance where you had a
*  credible sounding voice and an expert at the center of the thing dirty jobs was not that
*  dirty jobs was what if the expert is a septic tank technician or a welder what if the expert is
*  a skull cleaner or a golf ball retrievest it's a job or a sheep castrator an oral sheep castrator
*  which we can get into if you want um like what if they become your source of credible information
*  and what if the host somehow morphs from this authoritarian expert into a guest with a bunch
*  of questions so this conversation happened between me and some of the guys over there in in 2003
*  and they bought it they didn't buy dirt they didn't like dirty jobs they took it really to
*  shut me up they wanted three episodes and out the deal i made with these guys was rooted in
*  this paradigm of me saying send me out into the world to go on adventures and and don't ask me
*  to know more than i know but just let me look under the rock and let's learn together yeah and
*  so they said okay we're gonna you know you'll go to the titanic with james cameron you'll climb
*  kilimanjaro you went to the titanic no and i'll very nearly it was canceled a month before
*  because dirty jobs finally hit but prior to that i went to egypt i was exploring
*  tombs with zahi hawass i was at the pyramids i was in the some of the greatest the largest undiscovered
*  graveyard in bawiti the sands of the dead where they found the mummies with the golden masks and
*  nobody knew who the hell they were because it wasn't attached to any dynasty and who are all
*  these people with golden masks on their faces and so discovery would send me to do these these shows
*  and they were great meanwhile this this hot mess that looked like a german porno called dirty jobs
*  winds up on the air and it rates like through the roof but the problem in 2004 was that
*  and this is a kind of cognitive dissonance that always is super interesting right when a
*  when a big company or a brand or a political party or really anybody realizes that the thing
*  their audience wants is not the thing they want them to want that's amazing right and it happens
*  all the time and sure and most of the time when it happens you know the the uh you just walk up
*  you just walk behind the barn and shoot it and you and you never hear about it
*  but dirty jobs actually got on the air before it was shelved for a year and it was during that year
*  that i went on a series of adventures for the network doing this other thing why was it shelved
*  it was shelved because it was deemed off brand it was shelved because i was biting the testicles
*  off of lambs with ranchers and that's how they castrate their lambs they have for hundreds of
*  years it was not not that specific episode that that got me in trouble later but it was it was
*  shelved because it was an unscripted random romp we never did a second take on the show it didn't
*  look like everything else on the network it didn't look like anything else on the network it was just
*  a jagged little pill but they liked me and and and they liked this idea of of a more unscripted
*  look at the world and so we reached this kind of detente and i started narrating all their tent
*  pole shows and then i went to alaska to host deadliest catch which is a whole other story
*  that crab fishing show yeah that's 21 years now right and up there people died you know
*  that's a crazy job people died and i went to six funerals in six weeks and when they when we looked
*  at the footage of that and somebody up the food chain eventually decided okay this is a world we
*  have to get into but mike you're not you're not hosting two shows at the same time so pick one
*  so dirty jobs came back went into full production late in 2004 and deadliest catch went in full
*  production about the same time but i just narrated moral of the story is everything that happened
*  after that and around that i'm not saying because of it but but right around that same time i think
*  the media world in non-fiction anyhow began this migration from the age of
*  authority into the age of authenticity and ever since non-fiction has been has been grappling with
*  that just as surely as every other vertical because people want to see something that feels
*  like the truth and that's that's a sliding scale yeah that's interesting and that is what people
*  are gravitating towards more today and it's that's i mean i think that's the whole thing we're talking
*  about why like mainstream news is failing but you know it when you see it yeah you know it when you
*  see it yeah you could tell the difference oh bourdain yeah okay uh i think for me the moment
*  that crystallizes all of this and he and i were on parallel paths i think he was dealing with
*  his network the travel channel at the time the same way i was dealing with discovery we were
*  we were constantly at each other's throats trying to navigate this this weird line of
*  reality and authenticity and there's a there's a scene in parts unknown i think he's in um
*  might be sardinia he's diving oh yeah and they're throwing the fake octopuses in
*  it's one of the single greatest moments in the history of of it's amazing non-fiction he shows
*  you exactly how the sausage is being made but it's also like now you can trust him because you know
*  he's kind of sabotaging the narrative that they've created for his own show for his authenticity i
*  would do that for a scene maybe even for an act maybe even for a whole segment maybe if i got
*  like a like a be in my bonnet and i really just couldn't you know right i got angry every now and
*  then and i you know but tony dude he went out and got drunk i mean drunk drunk and shot the
*  whole show smashed and he made them cut it in and you can see him he's he's so disgusted just so
*  you're just so the audience understands right they're supposed to be spearfishing for octopi
*  and the local handler wasn't sure that they were going to find any so he bought some
*  at the market but they were frozen and dead and so tony's down there with his spear gun
*  with some other diver and these these frozen squid right to start to come by him and in narration
*  this is where he really owned it because he he owned that show like he could yeah nobody's
*  going to tell him what to say so his real rant happens months later in the vo booth when he's
*  just describing the heartbreaking insincerity don't don't they know who i am what did they think i was
*  going to do right so it's like he says something like it in the face of this kind of wanton deception
*  a reasonable man can turn to nothing but the elixir of distilled alcohol
*  and he just drinks for the rest of the show
*  and it airs yeah it airs on cnn yeah and i think it won a pea body was that the cnn one or was
*  that no reservations that was cnn was it yeah it was parts unknown i'm look i'm pretty sure
*  it was parts unknown i'm pretty sure i could be wrong but i think you might be right yeah and
*  god i just i mean that's what i that's what i wrote about when he died it was that parts unknown
*  yeah because i've been i've been sitting on a zodiac i've done that i've been in these in
*  this world where you're nervous you've got a lot of stuff to worry about and then somebody just
*  comes along and tries to produce a moment yeah you try to produce a moment well also these guys
*  they probably didn't know these italian guys like these fucking guys aren't going to find the
*  octopus we've killed them all probably right but i gotta think there's somebody there in his crew
*  somebody over from 0.0 the production company somebody must have you know who knows who knows
*  man who knows but look the fact that that happened is is wonderful the fact that he was able to insist
*  that it air that was important yeah that was important yeah well certainly important for
*  how you trust him and you had to trust him i mean he that was his whole thing you know you're coming
*  with me this is actually me here we go fly on the wall yeah yeah that was a very unique show too
*  because it taught me that food is art i really learned that from no reservations but it followed
*  over through parts unknown food is art i just i didn't think of it as art until i saw his show
*  and then i was like oh okay that's right because i just thought of art as being like a thing that
*  people make that you look at or touch i never thought it would be a thing you make that you
*  or you hear right i never thought it would be a thing you make where you eat and then i saw i'm
*  like oh these are artists these are artists all these people they've discovered these different
*  ways to make things delicious and okay their mediums different yeah it's just different it's
*  a different kind but they then hanging out with them it's like yeah they're all artists they
*  hang they talk like artists they're they're covered in tattoos they're fucking weirdos they
*  like to do drugs they're all listening to crazy music you know they're also craftsmen like i mean
*  to me yeah food is art it sure can be and it can also be fuel yeah you know it's it's it's
*  actually both it's kind of perfect yeah you could have both it could be art and fuel you
*  just gotta pick what you eat is hunting art um
*  it's a discipline um it's a primal discipline it's a discipline that connects you with life and death
*  in a very unique way that i don't think anything else does where you it's very if you do it
*  correctly right i'm talking about like mountain hunting like mountain elk hunting in particular
*  which is my favorite it's very hard to do i train for it i have to get in really good shape i
*  practice so i practice so much i fuck my back up because i was getting developing like tendonitis
*  in my lower back and i just ignored it yeah shut up yeah yeah we got work to do and so it's it's
*  a discipline more than it is anything but it's like um i don't know some people call it a sport i find
*  that wrong that's not the right it does take like physical energy you have to be in shape to do it
*  you have to be in great fitness but it's not sport it's a it's a it's a discipline it's a discipline
*  that's very very very primal it taps into something you didn't even know was there
*  it it's like there are people who've ever gone fishing there's a thing that happens when you
*  catch a fish there's an excitement that you're not prepared for it's a weird excitement that
*  excitement is you're going to feed your family and stay alive that's what that excitement is
*  because that excitement is like hardwired in your human reward systems and you don't know it's there
*  until you go fishing and then you're like whoa oh here he is get him get him in the net get him
*  in there oh we got him yeah and uh hunting is that times a hundred hunting is that hunting is
*  way different because you're you're defying their protective senses you have to make sure the wind
*  is going in the right direction you have to go all the way around if it's not you got to figure out
*  a way to move through the trees you got to move very slowly only moving their heads down i think
*  that's art i don't know man i mean it's a shot is art i'll tell you that archery is art a good
*  archery shot on an animal i watch it like it's art because it's hard to do it's very hard to do
*  when i see someone just hit a perfect 50-yard shot in the vitals and that broadhead sinks in i
*  know that animal is going to die very quickly it's a quick humane death and that's what you
*  practice for you know josh josh smith over at montana knife mighty chance sure very well he
*  sent me a video the other day he went on a big hunt with his boy yeah yeah yeah his boy got
*  wanted about at a few hundred yards huge moose big moose man fucking huge for a first moose
*  that's so crazy that kid hit the jackpot but the excitement on the video oh yeah that he sent me
*  and josh yeah and bow hunting is even more primal than that bow hunting is that times 100 so it's
*  regular hunting is fishing times 100 then bow hunting is regular hunting times 100
*  i just think you know if you're whatever canvas you're in front of whether you're painting or
*  whether you're cooking or whether you're stalking like you can like the the muse like does the muse
*  come to you when you're stalking does it come to you you know i don't have an answer for it but i
*  but but i know that people talk about it like some people say well you're in the zone you know
*  sometimes when i write i'm surprised like i just the other day i started i started writing
*  something on the tarmac of sfo and when i looked up i was i was at jfk it was like that yeah you
*  got into it yeah airplanes are great for that they're the best they force you into that seat
*  they're the best you can't get up because there's a guy next to you it's you get that laptop open
*  and it just comes out of you and i like a little couple of bugwizers look let's go i i i wrote a
*  book on a plane i believe it i i really did and and i did it mostly in moments that i don't really
*  remember when when time gets compressed and i and i and i think that that can happen when you're
*  fabricating something when you're hunting something when you're painting something maybe in the middle
*  of a set maybe in the middle of a fight yeah you know i talk to boxers who say that it's it's so odd
*  the way things will sometimes almost feel like they're in slow motion even though they're
*  happening so fast some fighters it's art well i think martial arts are art for people that
*  understand it if you watch it it's beautiful but there's some fighters that are just so artist
*  you you know immanuel augustus is yeah okay yeah that guy is an artist that guy is an artist what
*  makes him an artist because he's first of all completely unique okay doing a thing in this
*  beautiful deceptive way he's dancing but he's also he has an understanding of distance that's
*  fantastic so he's really good at avoiding punches his head movement even with this unorthodox
*  dancing style is fantastic he's stalking he's doing something like here's here's a manual like
*  look look at i mean imagine you're fighting a guy who's moving like this it's so crazy he was so
*  hard floyd mayweather said he was the most look he just punched him with two hands at the same time
*  floyd mayweather said he was the most skilled opponent you ever fought wow he and his record
*  didn't indicate his actual physical ability his abilities were incredible but it's just like it
*  was such a wild style so unusual it's like boxing a bobblehead right like prince nasim hamad had a
*  kind of a similar thing going on when he was in his prime nasim hamad was uh very very unorthodox
*  you see here's here's fighting floyd he gave floyd a hard fucking time because he's so difficult
*  to fight like look how do you deal with that and when you're a guy like floyd and you're getting
*  clowned here he's he's fighting mickey ward when you're a guy like floyd and you're you know the
*  cream of the crop olympian i mean a fucking phenomenal boxer just a fantastic boxer and
*  then you're fighting this guy who's dancing in front of you like you what the fuck but also
*  really good he it wasn't just that like you rarely get a guy who's clowning like that but also like
*  those kind of that kind of head movement skill phenomenal movement but also can dance in front
*  of you and land shit that you don't see coming because it's coming at those weird angles who was
*  his trainer oh man i don't think anybody trains you to do that i don't either no like what does
*  custom auto say to that he would never wouldn't allow it no he you know he was but maybe maybe
*  if the guy started winning like that he would change his tune so maybe people change their
*  tune when they see something extraordinary oh they see something weird you know they change
*  their tune they go well maybe fuck i don't know because you don't know sometimes you don't there's
*  there's guys that come along in fighting in particular that have styles that are so weird
*  and so unique you go wait wait a minute how come nobody else is doing it like this is this going
*  to work like you do you know strong sean strickland is he was ufc middleweight champion stands straight
*  up puts his hand like one hand like this one hand down here and beats the fuck out of everybody
*  stands straight up everybody else is down everybody else is moving sean straight up moving towards you
*  phenomenal head movement awesome timing and walks people down in a weird style there's a bunch of
*  guys that fight weird but they're really good at it well think baseball too i mean it's everything
*  louis tion remember the pitcher i don't really follow baseball you'll love this jimmy i know
*  almost nothing about sports believe it or not you know i mean you will one day you're going to look
*  at a baseball game and go hey you know what i need to do i need to play professional baseball and then
*  five years later you're we're going to be reading about it because you're going to go crazy with it
*  the same way you do everything for that but but this louis tion what did he do differently louis tion was a
*  pitcher and his wind-up was such that it looks sort of traditional but then he turned his back to the
*  batter without leaving the rubber right so this guy would spin all the way around before he threw
*  and he'd go further than that sometimes is that really unusual yeah yeah it's unusual
*  that's unusual oh so it freaks people out a little bit well yeah yeah because he just breaks he stops
*  looking at you look his his back look at his ankle that's crazy that's exactly it so it's like oh you
*  know if you're a batter you're like all right there are a lot of different pictures and i'll get used
*  to this and i'll get used to that and then this guy comes along that dude has flexible knees
*  flexible everything because look at the the angle his knee is in before he turns that's crazy yeah
*  yeah you would actually i'm surprised you're not in the baseball because i can't it's it's i don't
*  have any room i know the buckets over flooring yeah it 100 is you know like uh i watch football
*  now my wife's into football but i i can't i can only pay attention so much my my head is filled
*  with combat sports there's i have to follow jujitsu muay thai mma in the ufc mma in the pfl
*  bellator 1fc there's i have to keep track of a thousand fighters like literally a thousand
*  fighters right maybe casually some of them like some of the glory kickboxers casually i'm watching
*  you know oh botter harry's fighting oh you know this guy's fighting that guy's fighting i know
*  who these people are i watch them fight i'm watching fights just hours and hours in a day
*  i might watch my wife fights two hours every day is it work or fun it's fun yeah it's only fun
*  but i do feel obligated to pay attention like uh there's guys that are coming up in other
*  organizations i see guys have like a specific skill set that's unique like i contacted conn
*  mcgregor in like 2013 he was uh fighting in cage warriors and i reached out i said dude
*  you're fucking super talented i hope i get to see in the ufc someday and it was like
*  you know kickboxers like alex perera i follow him in glory and then finally he comes over the
*  ufc and i was like you gotta see this guy this guy is fucking insane it's like you have to have
*  some sort of an understanding of what's coming you know and also you have to like kind of be
*  tuned into the state of the art because the state of the art is very different in 2024 than it was
*  in 97 when i first started working for the ufc the state of the art is elite now you're getting
*  these 18 year old kids that can do everything at like a super high level and they're like these
*  phenomenal athletes that instead of going into baseball or instead of going into football
*  now they're just they're only focused on becoming a ufc champion and this is their goal in life and
*  they're they're 18 and you get to see them in amateur organizations you get to see them in
*  foreign organizations you get to see them travel overseas compete in japan you know so to me it's
*  like i don't have any room i don't have room for baseball it's interesting man you've had a front
*  row seat to to watching that sport become as dominant as it is at the same time you're
*  watching the podcast world blow up well the ufc blew up first see i was a fan of the ufc in the
*  very very beginning and it got me into jiu-jitsu so in 96 i started taking jiu-jitsu 94 i found out
*  about the ufc i've you know kept it in my head for a little bit i was still kickboxing at the time
*  just not fighting anymore but just training i was training a bunch of different places in
*  north hollywood this place called the jet center in van Nuys before that went under so i was just
*  interested in martial arts always and then the ufc came along and i was super interested in it but i
*  didn't really have a lot of that was on news radio at the time it was very difficult to have the time
*  to start training and then 96 i started training and so i started working for the ufc in 97
*  and that was when it was banned from cable you could only get it on direct tv and we had to do
*  these shows in like dothan alabama where you took a propeller plane it was fucking hell it was no
*  money this is 97 and is dana bare knuckle and dana was not involved yet when did dana get involved
*  2001 so i'm on fear factor at the time and one of the things me and my friend eddie bravo who's also
*  a big fan from back in the day and he taught me jiu-jitsu when we were first really into it when
*  we would go to like louisiana these were the only places that would sanction these fights they were
*  bare knuckle people wore shoes he could grab their shorts it was like crazy rules yeah and
*  we said you know what it would take these billionaires who love the sport and dump a
*  ton of money into it that's what it would take like someone would have to dump a ton of money
*  and then along comes lorenzo and frank fratida in 2001 these billionaires that happened to get
*  in love with the sport and so they buy the ufc and then they start putting these shows together and
*  then i meet dana and then i started asking dana like have you ever heard about this guy did you
*  ever see this guy fight in japan you've ever heard this this russian dude and i started asking about
*  fighters like you should try to get these guys and he's like do you want to do commentary and then
*  next thing you know i'm a commentator for the ufc okay this is this very weird triangulating
*  they didn't even have any money at the time because they were hammering money so i did the
*  first 13 shows for free and back to the art thing you must be willing to give it away
*  whatever it is you love you must be willing to give it away for a time at least well for me money
*  has always been fun coupons and so i was on fear factor so i had plenty of fun coupons so my thought
*  was like oh i have money i don't have to worry about money right now like i'll just do this
*  yeah this would be fun to do nevertheless you know i mean it was the same thing with dirty jobs
*  once that thing lit up i had to be willing to to sign a contract it was probably illegal i mean it
*  was such a ridiculous contract the way they own you so yeah isn't it crazy it's like no money
*  but yeah but if it's a hit if it sticks we have you for 10 years yeah or you renegotiate my ace
*  in the hole with dirty jobs was technically i was the host and i can host that show without
*  doing the thing in the show that made people watch right which was actually do the work
*  yeah there's no contract that can force you to bite the balls off a sheet right right you you
*  have to be willing to do that and so i i was able to fix that but dana i'm trying to remember what
*  year this would have been when did the ultimate fighter 2005 okay so in 2004
*  dirty jobs was on the air it was in that weird space where we didn't know if it was going to be
*  a hit or what but i was narrating all kinds of stuff for this guy craig peligian and i walked
*  into craig's office in hollywood and dana was sitting in there i had no idea who he was i just
*  walked in to say hi and uh and danick kind of knew me or recognized me and craig said uh hey
*  this guy mike he's narrating american chopper american hot rod he's narrating he just goes
*  down the list and and dana says say something and i and i said and i said previously on the ultimate
*  fighter and he said fine you'll be great
*  that sounds like danis just say something yeah that's hilarious it's great yeah that's hilarious
*  yeah yeah it's interesting how things happen like that you know well you were gonna you know you
*  wouldn't be sitting here now if your lease wasn't up or whatever yeah i probably wouldn't i would
*  have gone back to new york i think the art thing we should not be done with that yet there's
*  something i'm thinking about the clips you were playing what do they call boxing the sweet science
*  yeah so like art and science i think i think anybody who's passionate about what they do
*  can approach what they do like a scientist or like an artist or maybe both or maybe both i think
*  both so you know i i've got this uh this foundation that evolved out of dirty jobs it's called
*  micro works and we award these uh scholarships to people who don't want to go to a four-year
*  school but who want to learn a trade right we've been doing it for 16 years and uh i started
*  doing it um in part for my granddad but but mostly uh because there are what eight million jobs now
*  that don't require a four-year degree and there's 1.7 trillion dollars in student loans
*  on the books right that is just bananas and we've got these huge shortages in in the skilled trades
*  so i spent a lot of time talking about how that happened and and what might be done to to fix it
*  but regarding art it's like you're old enough to remember wood shop and metal shop and sure
*  you know before it was shop it was it wasn't just vo tech it turned into vo tech but before
*  it was vo tech it was the vocational arts that's what they called it and so we didn't just get
*  rid of the vocational arts we we started with the language and we took art out of it and that's when
*  it became vo tech and then there were a bunch of other acronyms and abbreviations and hyphenations
*  and so there's also a weird distortion in our society where we have decided that we place a
*  higher value on someone spending an enormous amount on education for a job that doesn't pay
*  nearly as much as the education cost where you're burdened with debt doing a job where you have to
*  work your way up a corporate ladder that might be hell over becoming a carpenter yeah over building
*  a house everybody needs a fucking house over being a plumber and if you're a guy who can figure out
*  how to do good carpentry if you understand how to use tools you're taught properly you have a good
*  apprenticeship you can make an incredible living it's very satisfying it's skilled it's it's it's
*  a job that is creative it's skillful and when you're done you bring satisfaction to other people
*  that live in that house like you there's a great benefit to it but our society has got this distorted
*  view of tradesmen and it's a really dumb thing because it fucks you up because if you're a kid
*  and you go through the university system you get a degree that's kind of useless but then you get
*  a job and you're making 60 000 a year and you're like oh my god i have 200 000 in student loans
*  and i'm doing a job that's not very satisfying and i'm kind of stuck i'm working my way up but
*  it's going to take a long time before i make enough money where i'm not burdened by this yeah or you
*  could have a successful construction company by then i mean you could you could get a small business
*  loan and you could you could start like hiring other people you could have trucks with your name
*  on it like i know people have done that they live very well and you know it doesn't mean you're dumb
*  like a lot of these people that live very well are very self-educated they read books they watch
*  documentaries they're interesting people and they're entrepreneurial but we've got this bizarre
*  thing in our head that if you didn't go to a school and get a degree you must be a dumb person
*  it's weird and it's not smart it's it's not good for for anybody to think that way well you know
*  i i very rarely play the devil's advocate in this argument but but i do think i know why it happened
*  or at least how and i was in high school in the late 70s and there was a very concerted push for
*  what we call higher ed which by the way already sets the table right yeah if it's higher over
*  here i guess we have lower ed over here right you guys are the language is is is awful but the
*  but the pr i mean and to be fair in the 50 60 70s we needed more doctors we needed more engineers
*  we needed more people matriculating through you know four-year schools but what happens with pr
*  at least from what i've seen is that it always goes too far and it wasn't enough just to make
*  a persuasive case for that path we had to do it at the expense of the jobs you're talking about
*  so if if you don't go this way you're going to wind up turning a wrench with a giant plumber's
*  butt crack and some other ridiculous trope so it's a lot of stereotypes and stigmas and myths and
*  misperceptions that started to swirl around the trades and that you know i i don't know when it
*  happened but i especially where you grow up like you know if you grow up in a place that's highly
*  educated like massachusetts where i was boston very very educated place yeah so if you were a
*  person that pursued the trades you were you know probably a failure something is right this is
*  like all you could do because you couldn't make it in school and yet you loved this old house
*  yeah which is a love letter to the trades it really is every single one oh i love watching
*  people make things yeah even dumb things like there's a there was a guy i think it was a pbs
*  show where he would um make tools and like do like stuff the way people did like way back in the day
*  like he'd make his own planer and all you know oh yeah and he would make furniture and shit yeah i
*  didn't have any desire to make furniture but i loved watching this guy because he was really into
*  making furniture it was his art he was yeah he was an artist yeah and he was authentic he actually
*  loved it you could tell it wasn't like this is like a scam like i know what i'll do i'll make
*  them take ancient tools and figure out no this guy really was into it well what's happened there
*  for me anyway is that i i mean after 16 years of it i can tell a pretty good story anecdotally
*  but now i'm able to go back and talk to people who we helped what five six years ago with like
*  maybe a welding certification and it's amazing when you say hey how's it going and they say how's
*  it going i'll tell you how it's going 210 grand a year i bought a van i hired my buddy who's a
*  welder then i hired a plumber then i got two h vac guys and an electrician we're doing three
*  and a half million a year got no debt and so like my job is to is to talk to that guy and
*  and i do that a lot on my podcast it's just like i just want to hear your i want to hear stories
*  of people who prospered as a result of mastering a skill that's in demand right and then maybe
*  applied some level of either artistry or entrepreneurship or the willingness to move that's
*  a big one too you know where you go where the work is or you know and so it's it's really become
*  it's why bobby kennedy called me back in february you know he was like hey man this micro works
*  thing you want to make it macro works and i said yeah sure what do you have in mind
*  and that's i don't know how i don't know if you knew this but we had this whole conversation about
*  like running together you know really oh yeah no he he asked if i wanted to be vice president
*  oh geez louise what'd you say dude i was in munich i was in munich in in january and he had called me
*  earlier just to talk really um generally about um about the middle class because he's like look
*  what you've done with the foundation that's my campaign is a lot about that and uh and i'd love
*  to talk to you more about it so i i kind of put him in the category of elected officials politicians
*  who might who might be useful you know i i'm not i'm not that guy but i said yeah look man i i'd be
*  happy to chat well he called back and you know gavin to becker right yeah yeah so um they did a
*  dive dude they this was very strange for me uh they did a deep dive and when i got back to the
*  bay area um he invited me down to his home to meet you know the cats they were all there and we talked
*  for like three hours and i i'm looking over my shoulder honestly like i'm being punked like right
*  which one of my crazy friends right put you up to this but he was serious and and i was weirdly um
*  flattered maybe like i knew i couldn't say yes but i was so interested in what his thinking was
*  right and we spoke for a few hours and then we stayed in touch for like the better part of the
*  next month and i actually really for the first time ever just tried to try it on you know and
*  it didn't fit you know right i would never do well in an office or in a bureaucracy he called me up
*  once to ask me who i thought would be like good vice president i was terrified he was going to
*  ask me oh yeah i was terrified i was like please don't ask that i thought my because i know he
*  asked uh well he asked erin rogers yeah which is crazy yeah i i literally heard the sound of
*  my sphincter slamming shut like what the fuck man like i just tensed up and i was like oh
*  oh that job like whoa whoa fucking job that's jobs insanity but man i'll tell you man he
*  it was a really um he was very gracious and very direct and i i tried to be too
*  and i told him i'm like look the infectious disease thing i get that the middle class thing
*  i totally get that the forever wars i get all that and then he he's like mike do you
*  do you understand 77 percent of the youth today wouldn't wouldn't qualify to get into the armed
*  forces do you understand what the crisis is we face right now never mind health health is its own
*  thing and i've got lots of things to say about it but fitness just basic fitness you know his
*  uncle was starring in commercials 45 years ago that were literally we'd call it fat shaming today
*  you know challenging you know i just talked to him uh the day before yesterday and he said you know
*  google any photo of yankee stadium sold out from the 60s or even the 70s
*  and try and find the fat people they're not there and if they are they're hard to find do it today
*  they're impossible to miss something colossally horrible has happened anyway he was very passionate
*  about all that yeah and i said but it's an important message it is an important message
*  it gets lost in this idea of being a compassionate person that allows people to just be their
*  authentic self you know and there's nothing wrong with being fat there's nothing wrong with being
*  big you're being lied to okay you're robbing your life of vitality it's just that's just the way it
*  is and i'm sorry if you're already there but it doesn't help anybody to pretend that you're not
*  there and the only way we get out of this is we try to figure out what happened between 1960
*  and 2024 what happened in the well we can figure it out it's not colombo this is a fucking this is
*  like the evidence is all there we know what the ingredients are that are bad for you we know what
*  we've done to the food supply we know we've done it's real it's readily available it's what you eat
*  when you say we though i mean human beings collective the collective intelligence what
*  percentage of this country do you think what percentage has been informed this is part of the
*  problem and this is why it benefits to have something like that in office most people aren't
*  aware of it you know i've had a lot of conversations with people though we have the
*  this really distorted idea of nutrition what's important and what you need and but what what's
*  good to thrive what's optimum versus what is just going to keep you alive these people think oh you
*  just need a balanced diet no you need to take vitamins if you do not take vitamins you will
*  not have full optimization of your body what do i want to take with d by the way is it magnesium
*  you want to take magnesium and you want to take k2 you want to take vitamin k magnesium and you
*  know there's some arguments from other stuff too that would also enhance it but you you definitely
*  need vitamin d almost everybody does and if you live in a cold climate in the winter time you know
*  a buddy of mine did his residency and i think it was boston and he was saying people would come in
*  and they'd have undetectable levels of vitamin d because they were just never in the sun and they
*  didn't supplement at all and you know there's some vitamin d in milk when they enrich it with
*  vitamin d but the reality is you need vitamin d and you need quite a bit of it and if you want
*  an optimal immune system that's really healthy it's imperative it's it's really important and
*  there's a lot of other things that are really important vitamin c is really important you know
*  vitamin b is very important bunch different b's you need essential fatty acids they're very
*  important you need all these things if you don't have these things your body won't function right
*  do you think that the basic fear and conversation around skin cancer
*  and the the lotions and the coverings and the sunscreens and i mean to what extent do you
*  think people are not getting vitamin d because they've been scared out of the sun there's a
*  lot of that for sure i mean the best way to get vitamin d most certainly is from the sun that's
*  the way your body's naturally designed to get vitamin d you're supposed to be outside all the
*  time and it'll make you healthier physically it's good for you it's it's actually a hormone
*  that your body produces when it's in the vitamin d is a hormone it's or a precursor to a hormone
*  i guess if you take it orally but what what it's doing to your body like george saint pierre when
*  he was fighting would tan and he would tan specifically not to look good because it's
*  actually better for your health and fitness you get more vitamin d that way yeah yeah and there's
*  there's a reality to that that's why people are really fucking depressed when they live in the
*  pacific northwest because it's raining all the time you're not getting enough vitamin d it's
*  actually bad for your psyche it's bad for your mind it's bad for your health your your again
*  overall vitality if you want to have a strong vitality you eat nutritious food and take vitamins
*  and you need to exercise there's no if ands or buts about it you need those three things
*  100% no shortcuts no shortcuts i don't know that probably not many silver linings to the lockdown
*  but i did i started walking i've always been active but i kind of backed off of the gym as i got older
*  and started walking every morning for eight miles and then you know mike easter um he became a friend
*  the comfort crisis and i started uh rucking yeah and so that's great yeah mike's a big proponent
*  of that big time yeah in fact when bobby called it's fun he's hard to understand sometimes and i
*  was impossible to understand because i was gasping for breath i got 65 pounds on my back walking eight
*  miles every morning he's like what are you doing i'm like dude i'm dying i'm dying i'm rocking i'm
*  rocking but um yeah i just i think it i think there's really something important in that book
*  that that easter wrote and and and i think our um it's not the specifics of what we can do
*  this idea of uh what do the japanese call it a miso a misogi uh a quest or a challenge of
*  sorts that you should well you should challenge yourself to do every so often yeah and one of the
*  uh one of the criterion is you should have a 50 chance of failure right so you it's a it's a real
*  push into uncertainty and discomfort and that that's why i rock it's uncomfortable yes yeah
*  i think that is an exercise for that part of your mind the same way cardiovascular exercise
*  works for your cardiovascular system i think the discomfort exercise is a real thing and you know
*  andrew huberman has talked about this there's actually a specific area of the brain when you
*  enact voluntary discomfort and do things you don't want to do all the time it actually grows
*  remember what that is remember what he called that part of the brain but uh you know he speaks
*  about it of course he's a neuroscientist much more eloquently but i think that's real and i
*  think um it also makes regular life a lot easier that was one of my favorite things of jiu-jitsu
*  when i found out it makes regular life easy because it's regular life is not anterior mid
*  cingulate cortex that's what it is engaging in challenging activities can stimulate and grow
*  this region which is crucial for learning or excuse me leaning into and overcoming difficulties
*  yeah and if your life is super easy and anything that comes up is a nightmare it's probably be
*  because you lack enough voluntary adversity to overcome uncomfortable moments so uncomfortable
*  moments are rare and when you encounter rare things generally people like kind of have anxious
*  moments encountering rare things oh well anxiety is a form of discomfort yes and it's not just pain
*  it's not you know that's i think most people equate discomfort or uncomfortableness with like
*  physical pain but the way easter talks about it it's it's also boredom like being bored makes
*  people super uncomfortable because we're so not used to especially today especially today you could
*  get this damn thing up and you know instant access to 99 but you're robbing yourself of a lot of
*  possible ideas sure yeah because the best ideas come when you're bored when you're bored i just
*  have some of my best ideas when i had no radio in my car because i would just be driving and my best
*  ideas would come while i was driving so instead of being entertained i would just be like thinking
*  like you're constantly thinking yeah you know and when you're involved in you know an ordinary
*  activity like driving where you're just so sort of like plugged in like hit your blinkers change lanes
*  you're so plugged in so you're in like this weird mindset and then if there's no nothing entertaining
*  you your mind just starts thinking about things right because sometimes you come up with great
*  ideas your your mind your brain will find whatever you send it out to look for yeah it'll just search
*  and search until it finds it and if you don't give it anything then it'll look inward right it'll find
*  something you know cold plunges not comfortable yeah but you know if you can find a way to to like
*  it i don't like it i don't like it at all i do it every day i hate it yeah but i love it when i get
*  out i the moment before i get in i'm always like can i talk myself out of doing this yeah i don't
*  want to do this right it's fucking cold outside it's 40 degrees outside i'm climbing this 34 degree
*  water but but but because i do it i know that i've already done something way more difficult than
*  my day i think there's a difference in in knowing what the benefits are of a cold plunge which would
*  require you to do some research and do some reading and do some thinking and so forth versus
*  just saying okay i know there's some benefit i don't actually need to know specifically what it is i
*  just need to know that there's a an overarching benefit in embracing the suck yeah i need you
*  know and if i do that a couple of times a day i think i'm going to be better for it and and that
*  that's useful that's been useful to me that's useful but it also is beneficial physically so
*  it's both things and i think that's the case with exercise too that's also the case with sauna
*  difficult things that are also very beneficial physically they seem to go hand in hand because
*  it's the hormetic effect your body's freaking out because of the cold and that's why it produces all
*  these cold shock proteins and that's why it produces all these anti-inflammatories your
*  body just feels better when you get out the endorphin rush you get you know the norepinephrine this
*  this this flood of these chemicals that last for hours ramps up your dopamine by like 200 percent
*  and it lasts for hours like you genuinely feel better so there's all that it's also good for
*  recovery muscle soreness and just general inflammation there's a lot of like benefits
*  but that's the same with exercise right it's difficult to do it's hard to do but if you can
*  do it man you'll be stronger healthier you feel better it's like it's like you've got to go through
*  that suck to get those benefits and people don't like that and so they come up with a bunch of
*  reasons why you don't need that that's just a fad that's just a this they all look like shit
*  everybody says that they all look like shit they all talk like pussies they're all just they're
*  cowards they're afraid to get in there they don't like getting in there they don't like that other
*  people get in there every day and they don't get in there every day so they come up with a reason
*  why getting in there is not really worth it yeah it's all it's all a bunch of hogwash it's the
*  latest fad it's this is that and yet look at the stadium 50 years ago and look at it today
*  yeah the evidence demands a verdict something something awful has happened it's like it's like
*  the difference between being hungry and feeling hungry you know that's something else i think
*  about a lot i mean how often do we say maybe you don't but how often do you hear god i'm starving
*  i'm famished like no you're not you're really not you can't possibly be yeah talk to a fighter
*  that's trying to make weight those guys are famished those guys are they have no water in
*  their body yeah for the week before they're living in hell they live in hell some of those
*  guys they start their cut like four or five days out crazy they look that that's starving you got
*  to really that's only your voluntary voluntarily starving you know it's not real starving real
*  starving is like you might not be able to eat you might not be able to feed your kids you're just
*  using willpower to starve that's so different than at any other time in history it's a different
*  feeling you know like if you're a person that's making your way across the country and you're the
*  wag the wagon breaks donner party table for two yeah and that's real starving real starving did
*  you ever read as a book by nathaniel filbrick it's called in the heart of the sea no oh man
*  this is the true story of the sinking of a whale ship called the called the essex
*  right and the sinking of this ship inspired herman melville to write moby dick
*  and what happened was and i think was 1821 the whaling industry in nantucket is so fascinating
*  this nantucket back then was basically run by women because the men would go out for two sometimes
*  three years at a time jesus hunting right whales which are just sperm whales they call years years
*  yeah they were called right whales because they were the right whales to kill right and in that
*  time uh it was a great source of energy for the country all the lamp lights burned on whale oil
*  imagine how many whales there were before they started doing this they were like schools there
*  were so many we this book will i mean it's it's rich in a lot of different ways it's where they
*  got the expression steely dan actually it was uh because it was just the women and it was a
*  a device used for pleasuring because they're the the men were all out to see
*  so they'd use a steely dan oh but you want to talk about hard lives the the business whatever it takes
*  to shoot the elk and get it down from the mountain i get it that that's a thing but when you read
*  through the real process of getting a sperm whale out of the ocean alongside the ship and then onto
*  the ship and the cutting of the blubber and the cauldrons that burn 24 7 on the deck and the
*  blubber that's put into the cauldrons so they're just making this rendered fat they're rendering
*  the fat in the oil in real time oh wow and and because they have to or it'll rot that's right
*  and so they just load up the boats so what happens and this is not really eating the whales too
*  no no no what are they eating well they've got their they got their hardtack mostly
*  hardtack is just kind of like crackers crackers biscuits with no real um taste at all it was the
*  it was the currency you're used to anything probably get scurvy you know i mean but they
*  would these guys would go all around the world and this boat the essex was a couple thousand
*  miles off the coast of venezuela and what happens is that it's it's the ship is the main ship with
*  the guys on it and then when you see a whale right you basically put the whale boats in the water and
*  these are smaller maybe 22 feet long and men row them right and so you harpoon the whale and then
*  you hang on and go for what they called a uh a nantucket sleigh ride so so the whale would just
*  drag the what if the whale goes under it can't go under much further can't pull two boats down and
*  it doesn't they they tend to swim in a in a straight line after they've been harpooned so you just
*  you just hang on and then when it tires itself out you row it and you back to the whale ship
*  do they kill it first uh well no no it's killed back at the at the ship typically you don't want
*  to kill it when it's when you're a mile from the ship because you got to drag it back they didn't
*  know how smart whales were back then either we didn't know anything but aren't that crazy that's
*  only a couple hundred years ago 1821 isn't that nuts well a couple hundred years ago the ocean's
*  filled with whales filled with them and like that because if you look now they're hard to find
*  and nothing hunts them no i never really thought about it they were everywhere i mean i knew about
*  it but i never thought about it i never i mean we've talked a lot about the um the decimation
*  of the fish population in the ocean about like 90 plus percent of all the big fish are gone yeah
*  which is really nuts but i never really thought about it that way when it comes to whales
*  well you can make a really good and really controversial case they made a movie ron howard
*  yeah yeah ron howard made a movie on this yeah it's amazing look i mean they're they were
*  everywhere wow so these guys harpoon one that's so crazy from from the whale boat then they get
*  tugged along look at all these whales and then while they're out maybe a mile from the ship
*  the mate of the mail of the whale that was harpooned starts ramming the ship
*  rams it three times oh no sinks it oh no now you got a couple dozen guys in whale boats
*  2000 miles off the coast of south america with no supplies
*  so man what happens and this is all in the in the preface but the story basically starts
*  when one of the whale boats is discovered not far from i think is venezuela and the guys look over
*  the gunnel of their boat and in the whale boat it's just like a giant carcass it's just bleached
*  bones all in it except for two quasi humans one in the stern and one in the bow each skeletons
*  huddled up staring each other with wild eyes just waiting to see who would die next so they could
*  eat them yeah and there were rules they were almost like cookbooks that were very common how
*  many people were on these boats double check me jamie but i i think there were probably a dozen
*  on each one many family members it was a cabin boy named john coffin i remember and there were
*  i mean a lot of these guys were related you know and and they they were dear friends and family
*  they lived together on nantucket they ate each other they ate each other man
*  how long was it before they discovered them they were at sea adrift i think for the better part of
*  three months that's him nate philbrook fantastic in 1820 the whale ship s6 was rammed and sunk by
*  an angry sperm whale leaving the desperate crew to drift for more than 90 days in three tiny boats
*  when did this movie come out 2015 for the movie the manuscript was found in 1960 verified in 1980
*  oh my god you want to take a deep dive go to the like the whaling museum up in new england
*  this stuff is this i mean in the day there were strict protocols on how to eat your friend
*  how to prepare your friend for consumption on the spot or did they have them prepared
*  they devised it on the spot there was uh what the rules no no they were written it was it was like a
*  maritime code so they kind of knew that this was a possibility they knew it was a certainty they
*  just didn't know for whom oh this was common that this was to find yourself with a group of people
*  hopelessly marooned whether you're on a boat or an island with nothing to eat at all there there
*  were protocols pretty strict protocols on how to draw lots to decide who would go first how to kill
*  the person who would go first who not to eat based on the degree of your relation oh boy so like
*  brothers are definitely off but cousins not optimal so like people were being prepared for
*  consumption raw uh i mean i i can't imagine how you would make a fire out there oh my god
*  unspeakable oh my god that's interesting oh and chase right the men spent over three months
*  to see and had to resort to cannibalism in order to survive captain poward and charles ramsdale
*  were discovered gnawing on the bones of their shipmates in one boat oh and chase lawrence
*  and nickerson also survived to tell the tale and all seven sailors were consumed whoa dude and boy
*  see this is why non-fiction is the best oh i know it's nauseating but i mean that book at a point
*  time you got to go i might wind up in hell before i starve to death because i've eaten everyone else
*  right well you're knowing you're starving to death and you've already eaten everyone else
*  that's oh my god because there's going to be one last person there's got to end and then there was
*  one oh god i know i know reality is so terrifying in that regard that we we have you know we're so
*  fortunate that there's so much food available the poorest amongst us are fat but the reality is if
*  that cut off it would be real desperate real quick most people get really hungry after five hours
*  you know they feel really hungry yeah description if you'd like to know okay it's not that bad okay
*  the crew according to chase separated limbs from his body and cut all the flesh from the bones
*  after which we opened the body took out the heart and then closed it again sewed it up as
*  decently as we could and committed it to the sea they then ate the man's organs soon they began to
*  draw lots to see who would be shot and eaten next a custom of maroon sailors dating back to the
*  17th century three men in one boat survived and two and another the three men who remained behind
*  on henderson island were also rescued after surviving on eggs and crabs for nearly four months
*  boy and this is why we have moby dick wow this is why the greatest american novel arguably of
*  all time was written because melville came from that part of the world and he understood the stakes
*  of hunting whales and he understood the absolute imperative need to get energy you can make a
*  really interesting and controversial case around how the fossil fuel industry saved the whales
*  yeah i've heard this before because had yeah had that not happened in pennsylvania in titusville
*  yeah not long after this we'd have hunted them into absolute oblivion well we almost did that
*  to mammals north america market hunting um there used to be elk in every state in the country
*  there used to be deer everywhere and we basically hunted them into oblivion the buffalo is the best
*  example of that of course the hell doesn't matter with us man oh we're fucked up and we can't we
*  don't see consequences we see what's in front of us right now and what we need to do and back then
*  they didn't really have a real understanding of what would happen that had never been done before
*  no one had just showed up at a continent filled with mammals and just start decimating them there
*  wasn't like a history of that it was also the invent of the firearm was fairly recent so it was
*  a lot easier to get these animals you know and then they had the henry rifle so they had long
*  range rifles so they were able to shoot buffalo from a distance and and then they you know for
*  a lot of them they only use their tongues they pickled their tongues and sent them back east
*  and then i was in a custer a couple of weeks ago for a buffalo roundup oh wow man this was a kick
*  this is um so this is western south dakota not far from crazy horse and um rushmore you know we
*  worked on a crazy horse for dirty jobs we did an episode mean the sculpture yeah sculpture is weird
*  because there's no real drawing or painting or anything no photographs of crazy horse no nobody
*  knows really what he looked like well they're working from a a model that seems to have been
*  blessed by all the appropriate parties but this they started working on this thing 50 years ago
*  and it's going to take another 40 before they're done i worked on the fingernail of crazy horse
*  with a whole crew what does it look like now i haven't seen it oh you'll love this jane it's it's
*  it's so mine but you you can take all of rushmore all four heads and put it on the forehead
*  of crazy horse wow that's how big this thing is and wasn't it like one family's undertaking
*  yeah uh court gorchak go to that last picture that you just had that one right there so that
*  shows before and after that shows where it was a while back and where it is now look at it look at
*  his finger in the lower right that's what you worked on yeah and i scaled down his uh forehead
*  to do basically some tidying up of his nostrils and whatnot when we were there it's that's crazy
*  it's massive it's absolutely massive and yeah this there was one guy uh gorchak was his name
*  and he was an immigrant and he loved the indian people and that's that's the model there at the
*  right yeah that's what's gonna look that's what we're shooting for wow and it's it's it's gonna
*  take another half a century probably but that's incredible you know it's funny it's very controversial
*  and amongst native american communities though right i don't know it is you know i think there's
*  some there's a part of is the thing that crazy horse didn't want to be photographed yeah you
*  know he really believed that cameras were like stole your soul yeah that was a belief back then
*  which is when might be on something well you have this novel thing where no one's ever seen
*  it before and you take an image of someone like that like if someone is like diminishes you yeah
*  also human beings at that point in time were so horrible to each other and these settlers had done
*  essentially demonic things yeah to the population just with diseases just bringing diseases yeah so
*  of course they would say what are they doing now well this is the fucking coup de grace they're
*  gonna steal our soul with this fucking box big thing goes off you gotta stand still this guy
*  korchak he was so brilliant on so many levels yeah i think he had 13 kids and that they were
*  basically his workforce he built into the rock the staircases that they needed to take to get to this
*  space the like the work ethic is mind-boggling what they did and he was a he was a real friend
*  to the native americans and he in this was a love letter for them and to them and
*  and who was uh crazy horses was it sitting bear maybe i forget but you know he he had all of the
*  he had enough blessings of the requisite players to to embark on this thing well i think anything
*  anytime you have some enormous thing you're gonna have controversy well you're gonna have
*  people that don't like it that do like it you know this for sure what you do but the difference i
*  mean for me i called when we brought um we brought dirty jobs back during the lockdowns because i
*  just felt like i wanted to be i wanted to be the first show back on the tv you know that was that
*  was shooting and this was one of the first things that that we did but i started by calling rush
*  more and i'm i'm not telling you the story to make anybody sound bad but it really just was kind of
*  appalling you know i said look i i want to bring my crew and and i i'm really i want to tend to
*  this statue this statuary this monument at the time you know the headlines were filled with statues
*  being pulled down and being disrespected for any number of reasons right right i'm like look i think
*  i think the park service does an amazing duty and i and i want to meet the caretakers of our
*  statue right and i would love you know to work on this with the people who work on it and
*  and they not only said no they were like are you are you crazy we would never we would never permit
*  anything like that like i think they thought it was exploitative somehow and i'm like
*  i want america to to learn the story of rush more i want them to learn something about the people
*  memorialized on it i i want them to meet the people who care for it it's just a love letter
*  to one of our monuments but it was a hard no and i really wanted to go to that part of the country
*  and so we i knew crazy horse was nearby and the answer was oh yeah come on out anytime man and
*  the difference of course was crazy horse isn't being built with a penny of federal money
*  um it has no federal oversight it's very personal to this family and the people who are still in
*  charge of it are true custodians of it it's really interesting when you when you talk to people who
*  are in charge of a thing that that means a lot to other people monumental in reality monumental
*  monuments yeah yeah i mean it's a some some people i think see it as a burden some as a challenge
*  some as an obligation but for me i you know the vast majority of americans are never going to see
*  either one of those monuments in person so to to show them right more people will have just seen
*  what jamie put up here as a result of this probably then we'll then we'll visit in person
*  and that's amazing dude yeah that is amazing when you think about a couple of guys smoking cigars
*  and sipping a coffee and just passing the time and all of a sudden you're able to learn about
*  the way they drew lots and the way we where we got our energy from just a little while ago
*  this buffalo roundup i was telling you about i mean it's there were only a couple thousand of them
*  and when you think about the accounts of the of the day when where the where the buffalo
*  rome was as far as you could see just thick do you know um dan flores do you know who he is
*  tell me he wrote a american coyote and he wrote what is it a buffalo diplomacy buffalo ecology
*  is that what it was i forget but the buffalo premise is very fascinating because the numbers
*  of buffalo he believes but they were in such large numbers because so many native americans
*  died out because of diseases so the native americans would follow the buffalo hunt them
*  and kill them takes a long time for gestation for a buffalo so when the buffalo have new buffalo
*  it takes it's a long time to repopulate but if the native americans 90 percent of them are wiped
*  out by disease when the settlers came here so there's no one hunting them for a long time
*  and so the populations grew immense and so that this was not something that was reported when the
*  first settlers got here when the first people came to the first europeans came to north america
*  and made their way across the country never to describe massive herds of buffalo it wasn't a
*  thing it wasn't a thing until after the native american population had been decimated by disease
*  and then the buffalo flourished and became overpopulated in a sense an unnatural pop
*  because they didn't have to worry about wolves they didn't have to worry so when they first were
*  here right buffalo existed far back before before the the there was a mass extinction of like 65
*  percent of north american mammals that coincided with the end of the ice age and probably had to
*  do with the younger dryus impact which is a theory about cambrian thing or it's at 11 well there's two
*  different time periods that they attribute to um there's a there's a shower an asteroid shower
*  that we go if you really want to get into this you should really um look up younger dryus impact
*  theory online and then there's a guy named randall carlson who's like kind of dedicated his life to
*  showing that this is probably what ended the ice age there's a bunch of science behind it in terms
*  of like core samples and stuff they do that shows that there's asteroid impacts that happened all
*  over the world during this particular time period and he thinks that coincided with the extinction
*  of the woolly mammal the the american lion a lot of different animals that just died off 65 percent
*  of north american mammals died off during this time period and you got to think like when the
*  buffalo existed back then they existed with the north american lion which was bigger than the
*  african lion it's the biggest lion ever so they're getting jacked by these massive predators and then
*  you have this extinction event and then you have humans start hunting them and so humans now horses
*  have been reintroduced north america by europeans humans are on these horses and then they're
*  hunting these animals reintroduced by the way because horses originated in north america
*  including zebras all horse species came from here but that was the north the bearing land bridge and
*  things moved around and when they the mass extinction event happened it killed off all
*  the horses here but then there was horses over there that they had kind of extirpated from america
*  brought them back in and now native americans have horses and so they are really effective at hunting
*  buffalo they get the numbers down to a number where when people are making their way across the
*  country they're not seeing them everywhere and then you have this mass event where 90 of native
*  americans die then you have millions of buffalo this is what dan flores writes about it's really
*  interesting 1830 40 you'd have to go to whatever it's paper 1850 is what it's yeah yeah i here's
*  the tragedy for me um i narrated a special about all that i can't remember it man really i mean i
*  i remember enough of it to know that i narrated it that's what i would told you three hours ago
*  i'm i said the ken burns one is that what you could have been yeah could have been i know if
*  it was ken burns he he always hires a peter coyote oh peter does all his stuff he's great
*  yeah but i am that's what i meant earlier when i'm like i i feel i don't think there's anything
*  wrong with me yet but my my bucket's full too and it's so annoying like i was talking to a friend of
*  mine just yesterday about how the universe works which is a show i've been narrating for the science
*  channel literally for 10 years and um you know he he he knows all of the information in the show
*  but he thinks because he heard me tell it to him that i know it too but i don't i'm just adjacent
*  to it right i know i know just enough to you know to keep a conversation on its feet but it's like
*  it's this constant thing man i'm i'm older than i've ever been and it's just nagging at me now
*  because it's like god damn i should know i i should remember more that i i should i should have
*  remembered more about filbrick i should have remembered more about um i don't think where's
*  it designed for it i don't and i think humans like yourself is this is kind of a new thing
*  like in terms of human history people that are exposed to so many different things so many
*  different topics so many different experts so many different timelines and stories that you're dealing
*  with that's a it's essentially a new thing with human hip and human beings you know what dunbar's
*  number is no dunbar's number is the number of people that you can keep like in your mind
*  memory in your memory right that's essentially born out of necessity and tribal life right so
*  we essentially have the same brains and the same capacity same hard drive as people who lived in
*  tribes 10 000 years ago yeah and but we're still stuck with this hard drive with this world that
*  has an endless supply of information and it's consistently bombarding you with new facts i
*  read that like bill clinton's number is way high like certain people's numbers oh who they can keep
*  in their head like the number of people you can you can keep it probably expands just like the part
*  of your brand expands when you do difficult things it probably expands there's a podcast as you know
*  dedicated to what happened on your podcast i didn't know that yeah there's a podcast out there
*  basically called experience i don't know what it's called experiencing the joe rogan experience
*  or something because because there's too much information on your show right right there's
*  just too much and people who love it get anxious because they can't process all of it and so like
*  there's an ecosystem in other words there's a docent to bring it back to art this is what we need
*  i think more than anything today we need somebody like if you're going to go to an art museum
*  you need somebody to lead you through i do anyway somebody who can it helps it helps man if you're
*  going to go see if you're if you're going to go see a martial arts fight for the first time if
*  you're going to go to the octagon it'd be better to sit next to you than than me right sure so
*  everybody would be annoying i'd have to say you don't okay
*  how much do you know why that hurts here let me let me show you can you can you feel that
*  i'm just saying that i think more than ever before people need a guide they need somebody
*  to make sense out of all the information because i don't think there's any there's not much new
*  information it's just accessible in ways we've ever seen there's new information too how can
*  there be because it's information is acquired upon the consumption of all the other information
*  like it's all exponential piles on top of each other it's it's not just now we know because of
*  the new information because of the information that we've acquired now we have a new understanding
*  so that's new information you know nutrition it's kind of there's constantly new information
*  nutrition how's that possible people have been eating forever because now we know more about it
*  so it is new information well it's there's no such thing as an old joke if you hear it for the
*  first time right so if i just learn that vitamin d is important but better assimilated with magnesium
*  and k2 i might say that's some new information but you would go no dude that's old information
*  you're just learning it right but it's fairly new anyway because nutritional science has really only
*  been around for what 100 plus years and the understanding of it today is far greater than
*  at any other time in our life because of guys like huberman because of these different scientists
*  that have dedicated themselves to educating people about nutrition the process that your body goes
*  through and it absorbs nutrients like and what what enhances that what you know enzymes different
*  things that you eat let me say it this way then there's a body of information that exists that i
*  don't know and then there's a body of new information that i also don't know because it's
