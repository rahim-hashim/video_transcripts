*  The 31st I think we did. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=23.72s)]
*  I think we did it on like New Year's Eve. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=24.72s)]
*  Christmas Eve? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=27.72s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=28.72s)]
*  Christmas Eve of 2009. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=30.2s)]
*  And here we are, 2022, and we're about to go into civil war, total anarchy, the purge, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=33.56s)]
*  all the above. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=40.84s)]
*  Everyone's losing their mind. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=42.56s)]
*  Everyone's losing their fucking mind. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=43.84s)]
*  Did you see the breakout in the zoo? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=45.32s)]
*  No, no. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=47.36s)]
*  Did you see about that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=48.36s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=49.36s)]
*  A bunch of chimps. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=50.36s)]
*  They broke free. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=51.36s)]
*  And they went wild. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=52.36s)]
*  And they gunned them down. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  They gunned down, I think they gunned down three of them or four of them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=54.84s)]
*  It says, insane things are happening. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=59.12s)]
*  How do you say that word? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=61.04s)]
*  Ferozic? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=62.04s)]
*  Where's Ferozic? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=63.04s)]
*  Let's check. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Germany? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Sounds like it, right? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  Sweden. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Sweden, okay. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Wow, they're pretty peaceful over there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  They're gunning down chimps. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  So it says, insane things are happening at the Ferozic Zoo. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  Four chimpanzees gunned down after a breakout. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=78.36s)]
*  And a fifth shot but only wounded. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=82.24s)]
*  Three more on the loose. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=84.2s)]
*  Zoo's are used to survey the besieged zoo. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=85.88s)]
*  After 24 plus hours the bodies still litter the ground. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=88.64s)]
*  Zoo says they were out of tranquilizers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=92.56s)]
*  What? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=94.92s)]
*  Bro, fuck zoos. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=95.92s)]
*  Is there a video of this? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=97.64s)]
*  Fuck zoos. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  It's just like... [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  I told you about that time I got super duper high and I went to the zoo with my kids and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=102.84s)]
*  I got really bummed out. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=106.56s)]
*  I wrote a story about it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=107.64s)]
*  About animal prison. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=109.96s)]
*  Zoos are horrible. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=112.32s)]
*  They're horrible. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  The only one who gets out of the zoo, I had that old bit about giraffes, they're the only [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=115.14s)]
*  ones that seem to have a good day. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=119.38s)]
*  They're like another day with no lions. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=120.9s)]
*  They don't give a fuck. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=123.98s)]
*  They're happy to be in the zoo. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=125.22s)]
*  They have zero problems with the zoo. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=126.42s)]
*  No one's trying to kill them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=128.54s)]
*  They just eat and they're the only animals that they let babies feed them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=130.26s)]
*  When my daughters were little, they could take a piece of like little tiny... [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=134.18s)]
*  You'd hold them, they'd hold a piece of lettuce out and this giant giraffe tongue comes out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=139.02s)]
*  wraps around the leaf and takes it from them and everybody laughs and you never have to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=143.18s)]
*  worry about giraffes being cunts. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=146.9s)]
*  I bet they're the majority of the animals like the zoo. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=148.38s)]
*  They don't give a shit like giraffes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  I bet they're, oh we're getting fed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  I bet there's things like chimpanzees and certain animals that shouldn't be in a zoo. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=154.14s)]
*  But half the animals don't give a shit. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=158.78s)]
*  I think the big one with lions is they don't get to kill anything. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=160.4s)]
*  That's like if someone just extracted sperm from you and you never got to have sex your [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=166.56s)]
*  whole life, you're just like, oh. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=171.44s)]
*  It is weird. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=173.44s)]
*  That's their instinct, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=175.52s)]
*  They have a built in survival instinct to chase things and kill things. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=176.78s)]
*  They're the cleanup crew. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  Oops. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  They're the cleanup crew for the jungle. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Like when something's slipping, something's not quick enough, the lions are there to keep [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  the balance. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=189.84s)]
*  Otherwise, the deer would just overbreed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=190.84s)]
*  All the antelopes would be too many of them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  They need things to kill them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=195.84s)]
*  So they have this insane desire to kill things. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=197.72s)]
*  And then when you just feed them meat, every day they're like, OK, I'll eat this, but I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=201.04s)]
*  just want to fucking chase something. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=205.48s)]
*  They don't even have any room to move around. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Dude, I went to, I was coming home from a gig once. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=208.92s)]
*  Actually, I don't think it was a gig. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=212.0s)]
*  I think it couldn't have been because it was during the day. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=214.56s)]
*  But it was early days of my comedy career. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  I was like 21 years old and I was in Massachusetts and I was driving home and I saw this little [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  zoo on the side of the road. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  Like there was a direction to this little ass zoo. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=225.72s)]
*  So I said, all right, let me just, I got a little time to kill. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=228.0s)]
*  Check out this little zoo. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=230.32s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  There's this polar bear and he was in a room that was not much bigger than this fucking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  studio and he was just walking around in circles, just walking in circles like a crazy person. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=237.16s)]
*  I was like, oh no, it was just so sad. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=242.04s)]
*  The polar bears are used to dealing with gigantic icebergs that they could walk on, frozen sheets [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  of ice, these little ice islands and they're killing seals and they're running around and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=253.64s)]
*  they're just out there in the ocean and the open air and now they're in this Massachusetts [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=258.76s)]
*  little box. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=265.56s)]
*  And it was the summer when I went there too. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=266.56s)]
*  So it was hot as fuck and this poor polar bear is just wandering around in a circle. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=268.66s)]
*  It's like, oh, why are we doing that? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=273.16s)]
*  We know what they look like. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not like the old days before they had video, you know, where the only way you could [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=277.6s)]
*  see an animal was they had to capture it and bring it to the zoo. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  We fucking know what a polar bear, you don't have to go see him in jail. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=284.2s)]
*  For no reason. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=288.76s)]
*  They didn't do anything wrong. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=289.76s)]
*  They're not bad polar bears. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=290.76s)]
*  You know, it's fucked man. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=293.16s)]
*  You've been out the zoo out here? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=294.64s)]
*  No, I don't want to. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  It's probably the same shit. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=299.08s)]
*  Where's the best zoo? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  There's no Columbus. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  Columbus, Ohio, that's right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  All roads lead to Ohio. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  It is the number one zoo though. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  That's San Diego. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  But is it the best in terms of like the treatment of the animals? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  As far as I don't, yeah, that's what I think, that why they're number one. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, well that's, I mean, I hope they do a little bit better job. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=314.68s)]
*  But isn't that like the prison where Glene Maxwell is where you get to do yoga? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=317.48s)]
*  That lady doesn't want to be out there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=322.32s)]
*  She wants to be out pimping. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=323.56s)]
*  They locked her up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  It's going to be virtual zoos in the future. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=327.92s)]
*  That would be better. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=330.04s)]
*  It would be really better. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=331.24s)]
*  What would be better is like you use Oculus and they set up cameras where they go [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=332.44s)]
*  around these animals, maybe like with a drone or they take a cat and they put a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  camera on its head and it wanders around with the other cats and you get to be there [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=344.68s)]
*  in this wild way where you just like experience them existing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=349.0s)]
*  That would be dope. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  That would be really cool. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=353.88s)]
*  Like the meta, if they did the metaverse and they did, you know, like you could go to [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=354.64s)]
*  places where there's a lot of trees and just put cameras all around the trees where [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=358.52s)]
*  the lions are and you could get like the cameras where the lions are. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=362.2s)]
*  They would be able to find it out and send that one through the metaverse and you could [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=366.32s)]
*  be like on the plains of Tanzania right now, just wandering around. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=369.92s)]
*  Yeah, they probably have that already for sure. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=373.96s)]
*  I hope they do. That should be what a zoo is, especially as this stuff gets better and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  better and this virtual reality technology improves. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=380.56s)]
*  There's no reason to keep these things captive like that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=383.96s)]
*  The only there's one argument and that argument is conservation. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=387.28s)]
*  They're taking endangered species and then they're they're making sure that they have [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=390.96s)]
*  breeding populations. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  Like there's a few animals that are like really endangered and the zoo is like one of the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=396.2s)]
*  only ways they keep healthy populations of them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=400.8s)]
*  But other than that, the fuck out of here. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=403.32s)]
*  Yeah. Or injured animals. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=405.84s)]
*  A lot of them are injured animals. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=407.4s)]
*  Yeah, they can't go back in the wild. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=408.92s)]
*  So, yeah, that's what it should be. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=410.32s)]
*  Like a large area where they can roam around and some sort of an animal rehabilitation [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=412.12s)]
*  center. It shouldn't be those little ass fucking cages. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=417.16s)]
*  Is there any video of the chimps? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=420.44s)]
*  I've been looking at it just like of those before this incident. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=422.68s)]
*  I haven't found anything. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=426.12s)]
*  I mean, that's just horrific. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=427.12s)]
*  The whole thing is horrific. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=431.76s)]
*  It's just like it's really scary. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=433.32s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine being like out there at the supermarket and you got your bags, you're [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=435.68s)]
*  moving to your car and you see three chimps running away like, oh, no, they must fucking [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  hate people. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=447.84s)]
*  They must fucking hate people. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=449.08s)]
*  How did they get out? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=451.0s)]
*  They figured out. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=451.76s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if they like picked a lock or something. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=455.44s)]
*  Imagine if they pick locks. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=455.92s)]
*  Oh, my God, we're fucked. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=457.76s)]
*  They got a stick in there and the other one's moving the stick. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  Maybe they pay attention to the way they turn the key. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=461.6s)]
*  And they're like, I heard a click in there. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=464.0s)]
*  Just that fucking click is the key. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  Don't get that thing to click. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=467.44s)]
*  And at nighttime when no one's around, they got sticks in there and they're going in there. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  There's some, I guess, would be anthropologists that are speculating that some primates have [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=473.24s)]
*  moved into the Stone Age right now. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=481.68s)]
*  So if you think about the Stone Age with ancient primates who became people, that process [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=482.76s)]
*  is happening right now with like chimpanzees and orangutans. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  Like there's a lot. You ever see the photo of the orangutan that spearfishes? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=491.04s)]
*  No. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  It's crazy. He's hanging onto a tree with one hand and he's got a stick with the other hand. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=496.24s)]
*  He's fucking stabbing at fish. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=500.72s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=503.24s)]
*  Yeah. They're so close to us. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=503.92s)]
*  They're just like a few million years away as opposed to like a slug. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=507.24s)]
*  Like so distant. They're not figuring out shit. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=512.84s)]
*  But monkeys and chimps and, you know, all those primates, man, they're they're they're fucking [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=515.28s)]
*  thinking creatures. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=521.84s)]
*  They're calculating, you know, and when they get those neuro links in them, you've seen the ones [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=523.24s)]
*  with the monkeys that can like use their mind. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=527.92s)]
*  But I mean, what would happen? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=531.76s)]
*  Like legitimately what would happen? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=533.28s)]
*  So if this is the argument that chimpanzees are moving into the Stone Age, what if chimps really do [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=535.0s)]
*  continue to evolve alongside people and then all of a sudden they start talking like what? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=541.0s)]
*  How do we do? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=547.4s)]
*  We give them a country. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=548.8s)]
*  Do we do we let them in the UN? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=550.04s)]
*  You know, like what are we talking like if a million years from now, if human beings are still around [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=552.68s)]
*  and chimpanzees have continued to evolve to the point where they start making clothes, they start killing [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=556.44s)]
*  antelopes and scraping the fat off of the skins and drying them out, wearing them as clothes and shit. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=560.6s)]
*  They start having rights. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=565.52s)]
*  You're allowed to marry them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=566.68s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=568.12s)]
*  Right. Like the same people that think you should be a cat. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=569.6400000000001s)]
*  Like I identify as a cat. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=572.72s)]
*  I think I think a chip should be you could marry a chip. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=576.12s)]
*  He wants to marry you. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=578.9200000000001s)]
*  You want to marry him? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=579.96s)]
*  Let's go. I mean, that's basically what that lady did in Connecticut. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=580.72s)]
*  You know, that lady that had a cat, she had a chimpanzee and she was feeding at Xanax and drinking wine [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=584.2s)]
*  and sleeping in the same bed with it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=589.12s)]
*  And then her friend came over and the chimp tore her friend apart. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  Probably because her friend was cock plucking. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=594.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  Like that was the speculation was that that lady was banging that chimp. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=598.8s)]
*  Because chimps probably have a big old dung. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=604.72s)]
*  I don't know. I don't feel like I've ever seen a chimp dick. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=610.48s)]
*  If you're a lady and you're not getting any play from humans and you got this chimp that lives with you, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=613.0s)]
*  and there's a big ass chimp too. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=619.08s)]
*  This is like a really well fed chimp. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=620.36s)]
*  So he's like, I want to say he was close to 200 pounds. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=622.08s)]
*  He was fucking huge. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=625.04s)]
*  You ever see pictures of him with a diaper? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=626.32s)]
*  It's really confusing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=628.6s)]
*  Because you don't know how to feel about that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=631.68s)]
*  Like on one hand, this lady loves this chimp, but you know, when it goes wrong, they don't know what the rules are. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=633.04s)]
*  They have no idea. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  Like laws? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=640.28s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=640.96s)]
*  I'm going to bite your fingers off. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=641.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=644.56s)]
*  That's a different one. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=646.4s)]
*  But that's a chimp hanging out with a kid, which is like also quite sketch. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=647.52s)]
*  But that's a little baby chimp. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=651.76s)]
*  The one that that lady had, I think it tore her eyes out too. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  I think those are glass eyes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=659.4s)]
*  If it's not her, definitely that's the other guy that got attacked who brought a birthday cake for a chimp that he used to have. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  You know that story? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=671.24s)]
*  He used to have a chimp that they took care of and they got to a point where he was getting dangerous and they couldn't keep him anymore. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=673.12s)]
*  Of course, they brought him to like a place where they have chimpanzees and they brought him a birthday cake. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=678.92s)]
*  And the other chimps were furious that they didn't get a cake because chimps get really jealous and they got out and fucked that guy up. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=684.28s)]
*  Just tore him apart, tore his feet off. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=692.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=694.48s)]
*  Wasn't that in California? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=694.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=696.0s)]
*  I don't know where that was. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=696.28s)]
*  But yeah, you can't do that to them. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=697.92s)]
*  You can't just keep them contained like that. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=700.4s)]
*  It's fucked. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=703.36s)]
*  That's it's not necessary. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=704.32s)]
*  It's like there's I don't think there's a good argument for doing that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  The whole argument is that people get to look at them. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=710.6800000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=713.6400000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=714.72s)]
*  You know, but there's parts of the world where their, you know, their habitat is being encroached upon. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=715.6400000000001s)]
*  They're in danger. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=722.08s)]
*  So then there's that argument, right? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=723.8000000000001s)]
*  Like maybe there should be a place where people protect them just in case they get to the point where, you know, they're on the verge of extinction because that would fucking suck. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  You know how devastating that would be to the to humans, to our psyche of where we fit in the world if chimps went extinct? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=732.24s)]
*  It was like, how many chimps are there? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=742.84s)]
*  Let's take a guess. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=744.84s)]
*  How many chimps are there in the world? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=746.04s)]
*  100,000. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=750.36s)]
*  That's probably a good number. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=752.28s)]
*  With all the zoos, it might be a little higher. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=754.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=755.72s)]
*  I'm gonna say 250, 250,000 chimps worldwide. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=756.92s)]
*  There's probably not even an answer to this question. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=761.3199999999999s)]
*  Are we right? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=765.68s)]
*  It says between 170,000 and 300,000 chimps currently living in the wild. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=766.1999999999999s)]
*  Damn, so wild. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=769.4s)]
*  Fucking nailed it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  It says wild though. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=771.92s)]
*  In the wild. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  And then zoos probably jacks it up a little bit. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=774.16s)]
*  How many chimps do you think are in zoos worldwide? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=776.56s)]
*  Let's take that guess. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=779.52s)]
*  50,000? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=782.4s)]
*  20,000. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=783.92s)]
*  There's a lot of countries. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=785.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=787.2399999999999s)]
*  Hundreds of countries. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=787.5999999999999s)]
*  But each zoo probably has one. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=788.3599999999999s)]
*  This is a dark question. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=789.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=794.0400000000001s)]
*  Before we find the darkness, I do want to know. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=795.64s)]
*  Let's... [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=798.4s)]
*  I do want to know. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=800.24s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=800.76s)]
*  Let's just guess. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=801.24s)]
*  Every state. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=804.32s)]
*  I'm gonna say 50,000. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=805.72s)]
*  James is making noises over there. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=809.12s)]
*  I'm way off. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=810.36s)]
*  It's a very low number and there's a reason why. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=811.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=815.5600000000001s)]
*  I may stick with my 20,000. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=815.8000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=817.24s)]
*  What's the number? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=817.48s)]
*  About 300. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=818.28s)]
*  What? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=819.64s)]
*  In all the zoos in the world? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=820.88s)]
*  The remaining 1,700 were bred for inhumane medical research. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=822.2s)]
*  They don't all go to zoos. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=828.88s)]
*  Like the movie 28 Days Later. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=831.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=834.08s)]
*  When they give them that rage shit and they break out. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=834.52s)]
*  Zombie apocalypse. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=838.36s)]
*  Tell me they wouldn't do that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=840.16s)]
*  Like before COVID, nobody thought like, well, this is a fun, you know, fun premise for a movie. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  This could never happen. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=847.28s)]
*  I don't know how many are... [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=848.4s)]
*  As of 2015, this article says more than 730 remain in government or private research facilities. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=849.84s)]
*  Some 540, I believe, have were released at this time. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=856.44s)]
*  This also says a lot. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=863.5600000000001s)]
*  This seems really low though. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=864.6800000000001s)]
*  What's the option? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=868.88s)]
*  If you're not gonna use chimps, would you use horrible people? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=870.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=873.08s)]
*  Mask murderers, prisoners. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=873.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=875.0s)]
*  Why aren't they? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=875.28s)]
*  School shooters. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=875.88s)]
*  Do you think people would sign off on that? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=879.16s)]
*  You know what's interesting? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=881.64s)]
*  They probably wouldn't. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=882.36s)]
*  They'd probably say, no, you can kill them, but you can't practice medicine on them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=883.48s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=889.0s)]
*  Can't put lipstick in their eyeballs and see what the root, you know, the shit they do with rabbits and stuff. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=889.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=895.64s)]
*  But if you say to somebody and go, hey, instead of using animals for testing, this person number is on death row. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=895.76s)]
*  Would you rather have that than killing an animal? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=902.28s)]
*  What, if you give them the option? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=904.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=906.04s)]
*  Man, that's a fucked up option. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=907.2s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=908.4000000000001s)]
*  I bet people would say the prisoner on death row. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, the problem is like the justice system sucks. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=911.7600000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that are on death row that are 100% innocent. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=917.32s)]
*  And so like a lot of people think the death penalty in itself is inhumane. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=918.88s)]
*  And in fact, the woman who's the governor of Oregon, she just commuted, I believe, 17 people that were on death row. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  And if one of those is innocent, I support it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=932.64s)]
*  You know, it's the most fucked up thing ever. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  If like someone killed your loved one and they're on death row. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=938.52s)]
*  But what if they didn't? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=941.72s)]
*  And what if they're accused of it? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=943.08s)]
*  And then they wound up getting killed. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=944.4s)]
*  I mean, it's like the system is so bad. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=945.84s)]
*  And through the podcast that I've done with Josh Dubin, who he used to work with the Innocence Project. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=948.92s)]
*  Now he does a lot of different programs along the same lines, though, where it's trying to get people out of jail that are clearly innocent. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=954.84s)]
*  And prosecutors, man, there's a lot of good ones out there. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=961.88s)]
*  There's a lot of good people that are prosecutors, no doubt. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  But there's also prosecutors that hide evidence. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=967.4000000000001s)]
*  They they withhold evidence that would exonerate people. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=970.7600000000001s)]
*  They prosecute people. They know we're innocent. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=974.5200000000001s)]
*  They railroad people. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=976.9200000000001s)]
*  They keep people from being able to bring certain things up in trials. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=978.36s)]
*  And, you know, you find out later that they knew all along. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=983.0s)]
*  They just they had this guy. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=986.2s)]
*  He was in the system. He was being tried. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=987.6400000000001s)]
*  And they never want to say, hey, we fucked up. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=989.64s)]
*  So instead of saying, hey, we fucked up, they hide all the evidence that they fucked up. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=991.96s)]
*  It's not all again. It's not all prosecutors. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=996.72s)]
*  But it's enough that the death penalty itself is very questionable. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm digging through this in 1979. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  I found a what is this from an article in Corrections magazine. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1005.4s)]
*  It says that 85 percent. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1010.64s)]
*  A few years ago, 85 percent of all drug testing was done in prisons. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1014.68s)]
*  Now it's down to 15 percent. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1018.12s)]
*  Oh, as of right now, it's illegal in California and plenty of other places, too. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1019.96s)]
*  The drug test people in prison. Correct. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1023.92s)]
*  It's also illegal to ask them if they have a penis. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1025.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1030.24s)]
*  Which is a little strange, a little strange. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1033.04s)]
*  I mean, I'm all for people being able to express themselves and live however they want. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1036.44s)]
*  However. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1041.04s)]
*  There was a story that I was reading. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1044.28s)]
*  I think I sent you this, too, Jamie. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1045.64s)]
*  About this article that was talking about this woman [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1048.4399999999998s)]
*  that brutally murdered and raped this woman and about how [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1053.1599999999999s)]
*  how unusual it is for a woman to brutally rape and murder another woman. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1060.28s)]
*  Well, turns out it's not a woman. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1067.84s)]
*  It's trans woman. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1069.9599999999998s)]
*  But they have to call it a woman. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1071.4399999999998s)]
*  So they're saying it's a woman. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1073.0s)]
*  Like, so there's people that are phrasing it in this woke speak. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1074.08s)]
*  If you want to define what, you know, like what do you because woke is hard to find. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1078.1999999999998s)]
*  People know kind of know what it is. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1081.84s)]
*  Like, I fucking hate all this woke shit. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1083.12s)]
*  But what do you what does that mean? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1084.6s)]
*  Like, what are you saying? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1086.52s)]
*  And when you ask people to define it does get a little squirrely. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1087.6399999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, I didn't think about defining this. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1090.6799999999998s)]
*  It's just sort of a thing that I know. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1093.08s)]
*  And one of the things has to do with gender, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1095.04s)]
*  because that was one that's one of the biggest cultural changes over the last 10 years. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  But that one is bananas that they would phrase it that way. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1102.3999999999999s)]
*  That they would say a woman. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1105.92s)]
*  No, it was his ex. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1108.8400000000001s)]
*  That was his ex girlfriend that he killed, that he murdered and raped. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1110.4s)]
*  Right. He was a man at the time. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1114.8400000000001s)]
*  He was dating her. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1117.6000000000001s)]
*  Like to say, oh, it's so unusual for a woman to do that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1119.4s)]
*  Like, what kind of game are we playing? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1122.0800000000002s)]
*  Were you talking about crime? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1125.76s)]
*  And like that person that went to jail and said he was a woman [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  and started banging all the inmates and got two of them pregnant. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1133.64s)]
*  That person brutally murdered his mother with a knife. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1137.0400000000002s)]
*  It's a horrible story. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1143.44s)]
*  The the the cops that came to the scene [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1145.24s)]
*  said it was one of the most horrific things they had ever seen. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1148.68s)]
*  Stabbed her from her face down to her. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1152.0s)]
*  Fuck the bottom of her legs. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1154.2800000000002s)]
*  Just, you know, an incalculable number of stab wounds, probably. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1155.5600000000002s)]
*  But you could say you're a woman and all of a sudden you're in a woman's prison. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1160.88s)]
*  And then there's like all these people that like have created a website, like, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1164.0800000000002s)]
*  get her out. She's she's not supposed to be there. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1167.5200000000002s)]
*  Let her express the gender of her preference. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1169.88s)]
*  And like, this is bananas. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1172.5200000000002s)]
*  Like, you guys are out of your fucking mind. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1174.88s)]
*  There has to be a birth sex on your future ID. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1178.2s)]
*  So you have your sex female and then your birth sex, like a male or something like that. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1180.7600000000002s)]
*  Well, that would make sense. But none of this makes sense. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1185.44s)]
*  They would say, who is the doctor to tell you what your sex is? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1187.72s)]
*  Well, it used to be just gender. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1190.96s)]
*  But now there's they're equating sex and gender. Right. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1192.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, so when that Rachel Levine person became the first female admiral, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  they were saying they were saying female. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1199.96s)]
*  They weren't just saying woman. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1202.68s)]
*  They were saying female, as in like like this ex ex distinction in the chromosomes. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1204.3200000000002s)]
*  Like, listen, I know it's good to be kind to people. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1212.48s)]
*  It's good to be nice. It's good to like. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1215.0800000000002s)]
*  I want you to be whoever you want to be. Express yourself. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1216.4s)]
*  I love you. But what are we doing? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1219.2s)]
*  We're we're we're in this fucking squirrely lunatic category. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1222.3600000000001s)]
*  Somebody has a great fucking bit that Bill Burr sent me. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1226.2s)]
*  Let's blow this cat up. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1230.0400000000002s)]

*  Jamie, maybe you've seen it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1237.64s)]
*  It's a comedian who says he's all for. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1238.92s)]
*  I'll say I don't want to fuck it up here. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1242.3200000000002s)]

*  Damn. It's just I get where it comes from. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1255.44s)]
*  I get that people want to let people feel free to be whoever they want. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1261.52s)]
*  But at the same time, it's like, at what cost to all the other people? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1266.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's going to be absurd. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1271.3200000000002s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1273.0400000000002s)]
*  They're going to have to have a separate jail just for like the in-betweens [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1274.32s)]
*  or some of this guy's things. Here it goes. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1276.96s)]
*  Derek Lang Wenus. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1280.72s)]
*  Is that it? Let me see it again, please. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1283.6s)]
*  Derek Lang Wenus. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1286.28s)]
*  It's spelled D-E-R-I-C-K-L-E-N-G-W-E-N-U-S on Instagram. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1290.04s)]
*  Trans women competing in women's sporting events. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1297.76s)]
*  As long as I'm allowed to bet. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1301.44s)]
*  Yes, I would like to put all my money on the lady with the size 11 sneaker, please. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1304.28s)]
*  It's a great joke. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1321.8s)]
*  Now, it's great. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1328.12s)]
*  And then this is how squirrely the world's gotten. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1329.0s)]
*  There's people that will say that that's transphobic, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1331.52s)]
*  that that bit is transphobic, because people want no criticism. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1333.56s)]
*  And that's part of the problem. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1337.28s)]
*  You know, it's like what we were talking earlier about, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1338.84s)]
*  like what's going on in Twitter right now. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1342.32s)]
*  There's a lot of people that don't want any criticism. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1344.6399999999999s)]
*  People have opinions. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1347.3999999999999s)]
*  They they just do. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1349.08s)]
*  You can't stop them. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1351.12s)]
*  You can't change their opinions. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1352.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, you can just be you. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1354.76s)]
*  You got to be you. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1356.48s)]
*  But some people are just not good at it. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1358.0s)]
*  They're not good at it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1360.04s)]
*  And as a group, if you achieve protected status, like a lot of people, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1360.8s)]
*  they feel like they categorize trans people in a protected class [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1365.96s)]
*  because they've been maligned and because they've been discriminated against. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1371.2s)]
*  Now they're in the superposition, you know, like some quantum physics shit. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1375.12s)]
*  You can't even you can't even criticize them. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1380.28s)]
*  Even they're murderers. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1382.28s)]
*  Even if they've brutally raped and murdered their ex-girlfriend, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1384.0s)]
*  you still have to call them a woman. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1387.08s)]
*  Even if they were a man at the time. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1388.2s)]
*  Still, it's a woman's very rare for a woman to do this. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1389.84s)]
*  Is it? Is it also rare for a woman to have a dick? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1392.6399999999999s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1396.3999999999999s)]
*  What what the fuck are we doing? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1397.52s)]
*  But it's not anymore. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1399.04s)]
*  You know, so there we are. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1401.24s)]
*  I can't even imagine what the world's going to be like in 40 years. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1407.6s)]
*  How about five years? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1410.3999999999999s)]
*  Who would have thought this? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1413.28s)]
*  Everything like the Leah Thomas thing with swimming. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1414.6799999999998s)]
*  Who would have thought that that's like the number one female swimmer [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1417.28s)]
*  actually has a penis and supposedly has sex with women? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1419.96s)]
*  OK, what are we doing? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1424.36s)]
*  Like, imagine if you're a girl and you work so hard to get a scholarship [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1427.08s)]
*  and, you know, you're born, you didn't go through [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1430.8s)]
*  puberty with male levels of testosterone. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1432.96s)]
*  Here's something I found out the other day when we talked about this already. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1435.92s)]
*  Sorry. Where James Cameron was saying that testosterone is a toxin [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1439.12s)]
*  and needs to be released from men's bodies. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1443.1599999999999s)]
*  Women have more testosterone than they have estrogen. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1445.36s)]
*  Did you know that? Yeah, I just found out that recently. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1449.12s)]
*  I found out from Rob Wolf. I didn't know that. Yeah. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1451.56s)]
*  They like that's their primary hormone. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1455.1999999999998s)]
*  And have more estrogen in women. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1458.04s)]
*  That's what I heard. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1460.7199999999998s)]
*  So you're you are the most healthy, unhealthy person I've ever met. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1462.04s)]
*  When you got your blood work done, I was like, huh? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1467.4399999999998s)]
*  He's going to be OK. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1470.6799999999998s)]
*  You've been telling me I am high on estrogen forever. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1472.0s)]
*  Like, you know, we made jokes about me eating too much edinomia and stuff like [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1474.88s)]
*  when I when I got my first blood work, when I first went to the tea place, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1479.7600000000002s)]
*  they were like, wow, you got very low testosterone. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1484.96s)]
*  You're you're at 240, I think it was 230. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1488.0s)]
*  And but your estrogen levels are some of the highest I've ever seen. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1491.7600000000002s)]
*  He's like, we got to keep an eye on that because that might be dangerous. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1495.72s)]
*  And I'm like, what? Told you. Yeah, I smell it. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1498.3200000000002s)]
*  I can smell it, I think. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1502.44s)]
*  So I just got my my my six week blood checked again. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  My estrogen levels have actually gone up. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1507.9199999999998s)]
*  And like since last time, I have so much tea and me know I'm like super high in tea, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1510.1599999999999s)]
*  but I can't feeling any of it because the estrogen is going against the tea. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1515.84s)]
*  So I have to take this. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1521.1999999999998s)]
*  How much how much are you committed to being healthy? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1522.0s)]
*  Well, first minimally committed like a guy who plays golf once a month. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1525.12s)]
*  Well, as soon as I start getting energy, I'm for it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1528.9199999999998s)]
*  But that's the whole problem. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1532.0s)]
*  Like right now, I mean, that's why I went to the to get my testosterone check, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1533.2s)]
*  because now, especially the last four years, I don't know if it's age or what. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1536.96s)]
*  But I just I wake up tired. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1540.44s)]
*  I have zero energy. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1542.44s)]
*  Well, we're old. Yeah, I know. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1543.84s)]
*  We talked about it. We started this podcast in 2009. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1545.88s)]
*  That's a long ass time ago, dude. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1549.64s)]
*  We're getting 12 years from now. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1551.2s)]
*  We're going to be like geriatrics. Yeah. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1552.84s)]
*  You know, if you're a woman and you have a baby after 35, they consider you geriatric. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1554.68s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1559.48s)]
*  That's just the label they put on it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1561.08s)]
*  Yeah. Bridget Phetasy told me about that because she got pregnant. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1564.12s)]
*  Like, I think she was 41, I think, when she had her daughter, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1567.04s)]
*  which they said she was a geriatric mom. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1571.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, my God. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1573.28s)]
*  She is. That's like one of them terms. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1574.56s)]
*  Maybe you shouldn't. That's hurts people's feelings. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1576.36s)]
*  It's like how they used to call kids with Down syndrome. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1578.8s)]
*  They used to refer to them as like mongoloid idiot on their birth certificate. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1581.08s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1586.96s)]
*  It's not really for them or their parents. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1588.0s)]
*  Like, jeez, the word idiot. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1590.8s)]
*  You know, fucking how about someone with a chromosomal disorder? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1592.2s)]
*  Yeah. You know? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1595.24s)]
*  Yeah. I saw a T-shirt that was from 1982. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1597.2s)]
*  That was like run for the retarded. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1600.2s)]
*  And it was like an actual charity. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1602.3999999999999s)]
*  It's golf. It's called swinging. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1604.72s)]
*  Oh, it's golf. That's what it was. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1606.0s)]
*  What? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1607.9199999999998s)]
*  I'll pull it. Like, that's how they used to just refer to things. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1609.1599999999999s)]
*  I know another T-shirt. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1612.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you know a bunch of T-shirts. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1615.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1618.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1620.04s)]
*  This is like, look, man, there's a lot of shit from not that long ago. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1622.24s)]
*  Yeah. It's so ridiculous. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1626.6799999999998s)]
*  You're getting real trouble for them. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1628.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1630.0s)]
*  It is. And just watching old movies. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1631.6s)]
*  Like, they still talk, you know, they talk like, holy shit, they just said that. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1633.52s)]
*  Yeah. Well, if you go watch old comedies from like the 90s, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1636.52s)]
*  like I tried to watch Superbad the other day. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1641.12s)]
*  And unfortunately, it wasn't the other day. It was a while ago. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1643.1999999999998s)]
*  But I was trying to watch it with my kids. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1645.4799999999998s)]
*  And I realized like five minutes in, like, there's no fucking way a 12 year old should be watching this. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1647.32s)]
*  I'm like, stop. I paused. I'm like, OK, we can't watch this. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1652.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's a dirty movie. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1655.36s)]
*  I didn't realize. I forgot how fucking dirty it was. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1656.4s)]
*  I just remember it being really funny. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1658.68s)]
*  But it was, what was that, like 2007 or something like that? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1660.56s)]
*  When was Superbad? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1665.2s)]
*  Sounds right. 2000. Yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1666.24s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1668.32s)]
*  That might have been the last of the great over the top, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1669.92s)]
*  fucked up, hilarious movies that you could never make today. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1673.56s)]
*  That and Tropic Thunder. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1676.4799999999998s)]
*  Tropic Thunder. I just watched that and rewatched that interview you had with them. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1678.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's still amazing that you could still rent it. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1683.08s)]
*  You know, like I'm surprised that in like Soulman, like I'm surprised I saw that the other day. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1686.76s)]
*  You could still rent that. What the heck? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1691.8s)]
*  Yeah. When does that become a problem? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1693.6399999999999s)]
*  Because, you know, people will probably mean they're already, you know, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1697.28s)]
*  doing things like getting rid of certain books that have like fucked up language in it. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1700.6s)]
*  Like they got rid of, I think it was Huckleberry Finn because it had the N word in it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1706.28s)]
*  They removed that from certain libraries. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1709.56s)]
*  Pixar's going in and editing parts out of their movies already because of things. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1712.3999999999999s)]
*  Really? Yeah, there's a Toy Story. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1717.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's Toy Story and the guy that plays Frazier, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1720.0s)]

*  And it's just like really scummy. And they cut that out. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1726.8s)]
*  How about the Pepe Le Pew? Oh, Pepe Le Pew. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1730.36s)]
*  Pepe Le Pew was a rapist skunk. Right. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1732.3999999999999s)]
*  He was a groper. He was a total sexual harasser. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1735.04s)]
*  Like he didn't take no for an answer ever. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1738.68s)]
*  Speedy Gonzalez? No, what did he do? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1740.88s)]
*  He's just, it's just like over the top Mexican. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1743.44s)]
*  There's a guy who put a sombrero on and he went around all these people in their 30s [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1748.4s)]
*  and he says, is this offensive? And they're like, yes, it's very offensive. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1755.2s)]
*  And they're like, are you Mexican? He's like, no, then it's offensive. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1758.72s)]
*  Like all these people said it's offensive. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1761.52s)]
*  And then he went to a Mexican neighborhood and he said, is this offensive? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1762.92s)]
*  They go, no, it looks good. They liked it. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1765.96s)]

*  It's crazy. It's like, is it offensive if an Asian guy wears a cowboy hat? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1771.3200000000002s)]
*  Like, is that offensive? Like, what's offensive? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1776.28s)]
*  Like, why is it offensive? A sombrero is kind of a dope hat. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1778.44s)]
*  Yes, it's Mexican, but you're not like stealing it from the Mexicans. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1781.96s)]
*  You're not like claiming that you're Mexican. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1785.92s)]
*  You're just wearing a dope hat. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1787.96s)]

*  like when we went to see Canelo Alvarez fight Triple G, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1831.24s)]
*  it was awesome because they had a mariachi band, full mariachi band. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1834.76s)]

*  They go nuts. They were singing along to it. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1864.12s)]
*  It was fucking dope. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1867.28s)]
*  Seeing a Canelo fight where it's all Canelo's fans [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1868.52s)]
*  and you get to see, like, in the person, in the flesh, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1872.76s)]
*  and hearing them all singing to this song that you don't even know, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1875.4399999999998s)]
*  it's pretty wild. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1877.72s)]
*  Speaking of Mexican, did you hear what happened to El Capadre [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1879.4s)]
*  in Los Angeles, the restaurant? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1881.68s)]
*  Did they get busted for selling coke? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1884.28s)]
*  No, something crazier. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  There was a... I just guessed that, by the way. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1887.84s)]
*  I'm joking. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1890.08s)]
*  I mean, that's where Lindsay Lohan used to get it, allegedly. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1890.96s)]
*  Allegedly? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1893.88s)]
*  But no, supposedly, there was a guy there with his boyfriend, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1895.68s)]
*  and he's an actor, and the managers came up to him and yelled at him, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1900.44s)]
*  saying, you're not allowed to kiss. I guess they were kissing. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1905.52s)]
*  They had a kiss on the lips. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1907.6s)]
*  What? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1909.04s)]
*  And said, you're not allowed to do this here. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1909.84s)]
*  Actor claimed he was scolded for kissing his date. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1913.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1917.08s)]
*  In fucking LA? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1918.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1920.28s)]
*  What? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1921.3999999999999s)]
*  Last night, El Capadre Echo Park, I was reprimanded by a manager [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1924.32s)]
*  for kissing another man at 6.30pm in the middle of our second drink. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1928.08s)]
*  That's usually when the kissing starts. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1931.04s)]
*  What's up? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1932.9199999999998s)]
*  Told, this is a family restaurant, and we don't allow that behaviour here. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1934.92s)]
*  We will never be back. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1938.64s)]
*  I encourage you all to find another place, too. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1939.68s)]
*  You should read what the manager said. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1943.72s)]
*  There's more to it, like, below... [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1945.3200000000002s)]
*  No, I mean, on that. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1947.44s)]
*  Did the manager respond, or is it his version of what the manager said? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1948.6000000000001s)]
*  It's more of what happened. I guess they interviewed... [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1951.4s)]
*  Other people? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1955.48s)]
*  No, they interviewed the guy more. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1956.28s)]
*  Like, that's just a tweet. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1957.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1959.8400000000001s)]
*  Where the heck did it go? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1960.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to say, right? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1962.28s)]
*  He said he threw his hands in front of us and said, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1965.56s)]
*  I don't care if you're the president of the United States, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1967.3999999999999s)]
*  we don't allow your behaviour here. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1969.24s)]
*  Since the post went viral, El Capadre said in a statement below, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1972.7199999999998s)]
*  the now-fired manager went against the restaurant's core values. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1975.36s)]
*  We have been in business for almost 50 years. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1979.12s)]
*  We accept, appreciate and value every customer that walks through our doors, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1981.24s)]
*  and this behaviour will never be tolerated in our establishment. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1984.48s)]
*  The restaurant said, in part on social media, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1987.36s)]
*  we do believe El Capadre to be a family restaurant, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1989.0s)]
*  and coming into our restaurant is like coming into our home. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1991.76s)]
*  In our home, we believe in love and equality, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1994.28s)]
*  and the fact that one of our employees made someone feel unsafe is not acceptable to us. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=1996.92s)]
*  That's a good answer. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2001.0s)]
*  It's kind of fucked up if that's all they did is kiss each other. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2002.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2005.08s)]
*  If that's exactly what... [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2005.76s)]
*  But what if they were just fucking just jacking it off? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2006.92s)]
*  Just jacking each other off and tonguing each other down? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2009.24s)]
*  I mean, it is El Capadre too. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2011.48s)]
*  If you know what El Capadre is, like one of the biggest scumholes in the world. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2012.92s)]
*  It's great, by the way. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2016.12s)]
*  We should say it's great. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2017.52s)]
*  And the food's awesome. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2018.56s)]
*  Amazing. I love it. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2019.44s)]
*  I fucking love that place. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2020.2s)]
*  Every time I go to that place, I have a big smile, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2021.56s)]
*  because half the time I was there, I was with Joey Diaz. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2023.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2025.68s)]
*  Because that was his spot. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2025.96s)]
*  He would go there and he'd start speaking Spanish to everybody. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2026.84s)]
*  Well, he was there for other reasons too. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2031.08s)]
*  Primo. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2032.8s)]
*  He was there for other reasons too. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2033.8s)]
*  But he was also there for the food. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2036.3999999999999s)]
*  The food was great. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2037.6399999999999s)]
*  That was the spot you would meet a lot of people after shows. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2038.8s)]
*  We'd go after shows. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2041.44s)]
*  We'd meet other comics, the folks that were working the Laugh Factory and the improv and shit. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2042.3999999999999s)]
*  It was fun, man. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2046.48s)]
*  That was one of the things that I miss about LA. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2048.08s)]
*  It was like those kind of little hangouts. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2049.96s)]
*  Remember Swingers? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2051.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2052.72s)]
*  That was a great little spot. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2053.3199999999997s)]
*  Good late night food. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2054.56s)]
*  And there was that Mexican place on Beverly that was like that too. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2056.08s)]
*  That was open 24 hours. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2058.8399999999997s)]
*  Coyote? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2060.2799999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2061.04s)]
*  That was the one with the great margaritas. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2061.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2062.8799999999997s)]
*  That's a great spot too. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2063.8799999999997s)]
*  And it closed down that one place we used to always go to in the hotel. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2065.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2068.44s)]
*  In the... [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2069.44s)]
*  What was that hotel? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2070.68s)]
*  The Standard? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  Standard, yeah. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2071.7599999999998s)]
*  That place was great. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2072.9199999999996s)]
*  You could get a real meal at like one o'clock in the morning. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2074.2799999999997s)]
*  Like steak and salad. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2077.0s)]
*  And it was great food. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2078.52s)]
*  That place was so weird. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2080.56s)]
*  I remember the first time I went there, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2082.04s)]
*  I don't remember what year it was, but it was early on. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2084.16s)]
*  I walked in there and I was in the lobby. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2086.4s)]
*  And there was a girl who was in a fish tank [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2088.88s)]
*  behind the managers and the front desk people [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2092.64s)]
*  just reading a book in her underwear. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2096.52s)]
*  I knew a girl that had that job. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2098.16s)]
*  It's the weirdest thing. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2100.4s)]
*  They're not supposed to interact with the people. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2102.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be like a voyeur type art piece. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2104.36s)]
*  So this girl is in her underwear and she's really cute. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2107.52s)]
*  You're looking at her legs and her butt [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2111.04s)]
*  and she's just reading a book with her feet up in the air [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2112.8399999999997s)]
*  on her stomach just sitting there reading this book. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2115.44s)]
*  You're like, whoa, LA. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2117.12s)]
*  It really is like this. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  When you come from somewhere else and you just get to LA [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2122.48s)]
*  and you see shit like that, you're like, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2125.12s)]
*  oh my God, this is real. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2126.48s)]
*  There's been a few times where I've been in LA [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2129.56s)]
*  where I was like, oh, this is like the real Hollywood. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2131.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2134.08s)]
*  I went to a party and they had baby lions there [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2134.92s)]
*  or baby tigers. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2138.3199999999997s)]
*  How the fuck is this possible? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2140.24s)]
*  Where did these tigers come from? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2141.9199999999996s)]
*  You would just go in this room [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2143.6s)]
*  and you were allowed to pet the tigers [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2144.4399999999996s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2145.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, up in those Hollywood Hills and Beverly Hills [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2148.16s)]
*  and when all those really crazy people get together, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2152.12s)]
*  there's real, the stuff that you hear, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2155.3199999999997s)]

*  I go, yeah, really. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2286.0s)]
*  I don't think Dave thinks about that much, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2289.0s)]
*  which is why he could be Dave. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2291.92s)]
*  You know, he just exists in this like cool zone [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2293.84s)]

*  and getting up there and killing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2300.2000000000003s)]
*  So like him there, the whole thing was so odd. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2301.96s)]
*  But I met a bunch of cool people though. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2305.56s)]
*  Lenny Kravitz is very cool. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2306.76s)]
*  So like a lot of those people when they're around, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2308.4s)]
*  other famous people, they're super normal. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2310.48s)]
*  They're like, oh, you're just a person [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2312.56s)]

*  You know, it's fucking, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2325.2400000000002s)]
*  it's a little bit of a prison of its own. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2330.48s)]
*  Did you ever meet Brad Pitt? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2332.16s)]

*  just thinking you're fucked. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2348.68s)]
*  Like why is everybody so friendly? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2350.04s)]
*  And I don't even know who the fuck anybody is. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2351.52s)]
*  You have to recognize people by the way they move [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2353.68s)]
*  and the noises they make. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2357.3999999999996s)]

*  unless you're, this is the only time you get to eat, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2552.56s)]
*  because you're a hunter gatherer [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2555.44s)]
*  and then like finally we found food I haven't eaten in days. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2556.92s)]
*  You're really not supposed to be stuffed. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2559.88s)]

*  always thinking you wanted to get stuffed. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2564.28s)]
*  That's when you got to the end of eating. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2565.92s)]

*  Oh, well they would get, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2570.96s)]
*  well, you know, if you think parents grew up [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2571.84s)]
*  with parents that were in the depression, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2574.36s)]
*  which my parents grew up with my grandparents, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2577.2000000000003s)]
*  who they grew up during the depression. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2580.04s)]

*  filled with money tucked away, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2585.32s)]
*  squirreled away in little holes in the house. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2586.76s)]
*  And they found all this stuff like after she died, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2589.2000000000003s)]
*  they like cleaning things up [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2591.5600000000004s)]
*  and they found like money that she had squirreled away. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2592.96s)]
*  Cause they were always thinking [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2595.88s)]
*  that the banks were gonna fail [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2597.32s)]
*  and that they were in a real fear of starving to death. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2598.8s)]
*  We are so fucking spoiled. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2603.0s)]

*  not knowing where your next meal was coming from [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2608.96s)]
*  to finally things turn around, everything gets, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2611.2400000000002s)]
*  and then they raise kids. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2613.88s)]
*  And then they're raising kids that are growing up, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2614.76s)]
*  you know, during the sixties. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2616.8s)]
*  And you know, things are much, much better. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2618.52s)]
*  And then these kids have kids [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2620.84s)]
*  and they just do the same thing their parents taught them. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2623.88s)]

*  for some people. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2646.2s)]

*  like spaghetti and lasagna and meatballs and stuff like that. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2729.3199999999997s)]
*  Spaghetti with red sauce, with meatballs. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2732.36s)]
*  They don't have that over there. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2734.64s)]
*  Grated cheese all over it and shit. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2735.7599999999998s)]
*  They don't have that over there. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2737.3199999999997s)]
*  It's like everything over there is like, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2738.16s)]
*  the pasta is much more consumable for whatever reason. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2740.96s)]
*  It doesn't fuck with your digestive system [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2743.6400000000003s)]
*  because of the different wheat they use. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2745.2400000000002s)]
*  But also the portions are smaller and it's a long process. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2747.1200000000003s)]
*  You sit down for a long meal. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2750.52s)]
*  People are drinking wine and enjoying themselves [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2752.4s)]
*  because they didn't go to America. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2756.32s)]
*  They weren't the wild motherfuckers that took that trip [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2759.04s)]
*  and took a chance and went across the road, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2761.88s)]
*  or went across the ocean rather, before they invented film. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2764.1200000000003s)]
*  Like you couldn't even see a video [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2767.48s)]
*  of what America looked like back then. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2769.2s)]
*  When did they start coming over here? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2772.08s)]
*  Like when did Italians start making their way over here? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2773.9199999999996s)]
*  It was probably like the end of the 19th century, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2776.6s)]
*  if I had to guess. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2780.56s)]
*  My grandparents came over here [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2782.12s)]
*  in the beginning of the 20th century. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2783.56s)]
*  It's like, man, we're so lucky we're living now. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2787.48s)]
*  This is so much better time to live. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2790.9199999999996s)]
*  But kind of not. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2793.04s)]
*  I kind of want to go back to the 1900s. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2794.2s)]
*  I don't want to go back to that time. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2797.36s)]
*  I don't want to, I like it now. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2799.52s)]
*  I think I have a healthy perspective [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2801.28s)]
*  on what it's like to live in 2022. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2803.1200000000003s)]
*  There's problems that we have that are very unique. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2806.32s)]
*  But I think every single generation, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2808.84s)]
*  the generation that had the car, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2812.36s)]
*  like all of a sudden you could drive everywhere. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2814.2400000000002s)]
*  Like the generation where they developed the printing press. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2816.8s)]
*  Like, oh my God, we're reading things? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2820.28s)]
*  Do you know what most books were [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2822.88s)]
*  when they first invented books? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2824.04s)]
*  You think of like, oh, they wrote knowledge down [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2826.64s)]
*  and this is how they wrote history [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2829.44s)]
*  and documented things for future generations. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2831.7599999999998s)]
*  Nope, it's like How to Spot a Witch. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2834.08s)]
*  Those kind of books, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2839.16s)]
*  they probably led to so many people killing people [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2840.6s)]
*  because they thought they were witches. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2842.56s)]
*  Like, it's stupid shit. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2844.12s)]
*  Because you think most of the people back then [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2845.68s)]
*  were not educated at all. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2848.16s)]
*  Like a lot of people probably couldn't read. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2850.7599999999998s)]
*  So when books finally came around, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2853.6s)]
*  people started reading, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2856.4s)]
*  you're dealing with people that are like super unsophisticated, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2857.24s)]
*  probably a lot of them, very superstitious. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2859.36s)]
*  They really believed in that kind of stuff. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2863.12s)]
*  I wonder if there's people against books when it came out. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2868.4s)]
*  They're teaching the devil. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2870.48s)]
*  100%, always. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2871.84s)]
*  There was definitely people [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2874.0s)]
*  that were upset about the printing press. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2875.48s)]
*  They thought the printing press was gonna fuck everything up [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2877.24s)]
*  and that books should be written [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2879.2s)]
*  in like a fucking feather, quill, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2881.16s)]
*  and elegant handwriting. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2885.0s)]
*  You could just go back and look at the way they used to write [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2887.32s)]
*  where all their letters were perfect. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2890.36s)]
*  They were all the same height [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2892.2400000000002s)]
*  and it was beautiful to look at. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2893.6400000000003s)]
*  Like if you look at the way I write my notes, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2895.7200000000003s)]
*  I fucking have deteriorated. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2898.92s)]
*  Like we have completely regressed. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2901.32s)]
*  They don't even teach cursive anymore in most schools. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2903.92s)]
*  My mom still writes me cursive letters [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2905.84s)]
*  and I've almost not been able to read half of the letter now [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2907.8s)]
*  because I'm like, I don't remember how to read this. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2911.7200000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2913.7200000000003s)]
*  When was the last time you read cursive? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2915.4s)]
*  One thing about cursive is that AI doesn't read cursive. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2916.24s)]
*  So if you wanna talk shit on Instagram, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2919.12s)]
*  make a post and put it in cursive [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2921.84s)]
*  and then take a photo of that thing and then post that. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2924.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2928.12s)]
*  And that way it won't flag all your shit talking. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2929.08s)]
*  All the things that, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2931.48s)]
*  like there's certain words that get flagged. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2932.32s)]
*  Yeah, I fuck around with AI a lot. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2935.4s)]
*  I use it all the time and it flags certain things. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2937.88s)]
*  So you have to be really creative [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2941.2s)]
*  instead of like a woman's breast. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2942.32s)]
*  You gotta be like, Victoria's Secret. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2944.68s)]
*  You have to use all these words [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2947.3199999999997s)]
*  that try to get her to have good boobs and stuff. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2948.4s)]
*  But then how do they do all those dirty ones? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2951.3599999999997s)]
*  Like I've seen Joey Diaz with giant dicks. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2953.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well there's a few that allow you to do dirty ones [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2955.16s)]
*  but they're not as good, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2958.7999999999997s)]
*  usually as good as the legit ones. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2959.64s)]
*  The one I use, I pay like 30 bucks a month for. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2962.8399999999997s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2966.08s)]
*  That's more than Netflix, isn't it? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2966.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2968.04s)]
*  But it's so much more fun. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2969.08s)]
*  It's addicting. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2970.64s)]
*  I would just sit there and spend like hours [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2972.0s)]
*  trying to make AI to make the perfect poster [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2974.08s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2977.36s)]
*  It's perfect for posters. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2978.2s)]
*  The illustrators are getting very upset. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2979.48s)]
*  People are very upset. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2981.8s)]
*  There's a guy who just made a children's book [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2982.76s)]
*  and all the illustrations have been generated with AI [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2984.84s)]
*  and people are super upset with him. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2987.8s)]
*  I was just looking though, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=2990.44s)]

*  It's something high, right? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3007.6400000000003s)]
*  It says used controversial AI art for new shooters. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3008.76s)]
*  Isn't it interesting that [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3012.32s)]
*  it's all computer generated images anyway, right? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3014.28s)]

*  This idea that you're putting people out of work, yeah. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3044.68s)]
*  That's true. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3048.24s)]
*  But that's also the case with autonomous trucks. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3049.3199999999997s)]
*  Like should we not have autonomous trucks that never crash [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3053.96s)]
*  or should we let truckers get high on meth [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3056.96s)]
*  and drive across the country? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3058.68s)]
*  Which they don't anymore, I should just say. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3061.08s)]
*  They actually limit the amount of time [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3061.92s)]
*  that they're allowed to be behind the wheel, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3064.3199999999997s)]
*  where they used to just fucking meth up and let's go. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3065.6s)]
*  And they make it across the whole country in a day. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3068.44s)]
*  They're not allowed to do that anymore. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3070.92s)]
*  I see why artists are pissed though, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3073.56s)]
*  not because they're gonna lose their job, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3075.12s)]
*  which they definitely are because it's amazing with AI. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3076.96s)]
*  But AI takes from other artists, like a style of an artist. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3080.4s)]
*  So you can see other people's work in the AI. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3084.16s)]
*  AI is using their kind of style. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3088.08s)]
*  So I see that, it's kind of like copying [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3091.04s)]
*  and just changing little things. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3092.64s)]
*  I posted some of that the other day from Alex Gray. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3094.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3096.52s)]
*  Look, I love Dearly. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3097.36s)]
*  I've had Alex on the podcast before. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3098.2s)]
*  I think his art is amazing. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3099.56s)]
*  But this stuff is incredible. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3101.08s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3102.4s)]
*  Go one more to the right of that. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3103.44s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3106.7999999999997s)]
*  These are insane, man. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3108.04s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3109.68s)]
*  Look how gorgeous that is. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3110.6s)]
*  And that's done in Alex Gray style. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3112.64s)]
*  And a lot of people don't like it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3116.48s)]
*  They're upset with it. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3117.88s)]
*  Look at that, come on, man. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3118.72s)]
*  That's fucking beautiful. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3120.6000000000004s)]
*  Even how one eye is different than the other eye. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3121.84s)]
*  One eye is kind of droopy. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3124.32s)]
*  Look at that, that is amazing. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3125.44s)]
*  Anyone that says that's not beautiful [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3127.44s)]
*  because it wasn't totally done by the hand of a man [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3129.2000000000003s)]
*  or a woman or a non-binary person, look at that. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3132.28s)]
*  That's incredible, man. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3135.44s)]
*  Look at this, where the skulls go into the mushroom. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3136.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, that is fucking beautiful. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3139.28s)]
*  And it is created by a person [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3142.36s)]
*  because a person had to program this thing. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3144.1600000000003s)]
*  Is it the same? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3146.44s)]
*  Do I value it the same? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3147.52s)]
*  No, because what I value from a piece of art [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3148.88s)]
*  is that someone created it. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3151.52s)]
*  There's a thing about it, but it's a different thing. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3153.48s)]
*  I still think that's beautiful. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3155.92s)]
*  When I see a video game that uses that new Unreal engine [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3159.32s)]
*  that's incredible, I don't get upset [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3165.4s)]
*  that someone didn't paint that. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3168.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't get upset that someone didn't create the textures [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3171.04s)]
*  all on their own. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3173.32s)]
*  I just look at it and say, that's beautiful. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3174.1400000000003s)]
*  But is it the same as someone doing an amazing animation [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3175.92s)]
*  that they drew by hand like the old Mickey Mouse days? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3178.96s)]
*  No, no, those are different things. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3181.32s)]
*  But just because someone can do it better now [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3183.12s)]
*  with technology doesn't mean it's bad. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3185.96s)]
*  Like fuck AI art, okay. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3188.96s)]
*  But isn't it gorgeous? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3192.36s)]
*  I get what people are saying, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3195.36s)]
*  that you're taking someone's style. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3196.64s)]
*  But I think human beings are still gonna make [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3198.12s)]
*  the distinction of something being gorgeous. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3201.2000000000003s)]
*  That a person makes, like a person does it with their hand. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3205.04s)]
*  They're gonna like that more, always. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3209.2799999999997s)]
*  I just did Joe Rogan in the style of Alex Gray. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3211.2s)]
*  Oh my God, that quickly? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3213.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3215.64s)]
*  There's a voice changer that I've used [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3219.0s)]
*  to make my voice sound like yours. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3220.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3222.2799999999997s)]
*  Have you seen that yet? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3223.24s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3224.08s)]
*  It's pretty good. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3224.92s)]
*  I saw one where they had me doing a podcast [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3225.74s)]
*  with Steve Jobs. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3227.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3228.6s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3229.44s)]
*  It is so crazy. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3230.2599999999998s)]
*  And it's just a matter of time before [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3231.16s)]
*  that's just available to everyone. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3233.3999999999996s)]
*  Everyone uses it. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3236.2799999999997s)]
*  You like a girl, you have a video where she says, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3239.48s)]
*  Brian, I love you. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3242.48s)]
*  And you send it to her and she's like, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3243.7999999999997s)]
*  what the fuck, I never said this. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3244.96s)]
*  What is this? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3250.56s)]
*  Is this fake? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3251.64s)]
*  Contemporary terms it is not. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3252.48s)]
*  What if I were to tell you that I'm not even a human being? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3254.7999999999997s)]
*  Would you believe me? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3259.12s)]
*  What is your perception of reality? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3261.3599999999997s)]
*  Is it the ability to capture, process, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3264.72s)]
*  and make sense of the information our senses receive? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3267.3999999999996s)]
*  If you can see, hear, taste, or smell something, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3272.3199999999997s)]
*  does that make it real? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3276.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, this is incredible. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3278.3599999999997s)]
*  So this guy is this bald dude [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3281.3199999999997s)]
*  who's a white guy on the bottom. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3285.08s)]
*  Pathetic reality. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3287.08s)]
*  And he's, there's a Morgan Freeman [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3288.2400000000002s)]
*  that's artificially generated that's above him [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3291.08s)]
*  that's saying the words that he's saying [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3293.52s)]
*  in Morgan Freeman's voice. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3294.68s)]
*  And it looks flawless. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3296.04s)]
*  In real time. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3297.56s)]
*  He's talking in real time. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3298.38s)]
*  Is it definitely in real time? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3300.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's him right there doing it exactly. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3301.2s)]
*  He might have edited himself back in to make this video. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3303.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3306.7200000000003s)]
*  But he was recording his voice probably in real time. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3307.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3309.6s)]
*  And then it's generating that in real time. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3310.44s)]
*  But he might've done a little bit of extra work [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3311.66s)]
*  to make this all happen and make it look so unbelievable. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3313.44s)]
*  But as processing power gets better, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3316.08s)]
*  the fact that they can do that in real time [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3318.0s)]
*  just shows you how amazing the processing power is. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3320.08s)]
*  Like if it gets better and better than that, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3322.88s)]
*  they'll be able to not just do a person's face [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3326.64s)]
*  with a black background, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3328.96s)]
*  but like a complex imagery in the background. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3330.12s)]
*  Like that person could be on the moon. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3332.36s)]
*  That person could be in Antarctica. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3333.64s)]
*  And then you mix robot with that realistic robot. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3336.7599999999998s)]
*  So like the robot that Elon's making. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3339.74s)]
*  And then you put like a fake skin on him. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3341.48s)]
*  And then in real time, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3342.96s)]
*  that could be a robot Joe Rogan in voice wise. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3344.36s)]
*  100%. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3346.7200000000003s)]
*  That's coming for sure. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3347.56s)]
*  For sure everyone's gonna have like Scarlett Johansson [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3348.96s)]
*  in their house that's like, they're maid. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3352.4s)]

*  I don't remember. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3629.48s)]
*  But it's just gonna happen over and over and over again. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3630.32s)]
*  I'm probably gonna get some kind of surgery, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3633.48s)]
*  but if it happens every six years, that's fine. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3635.04s)]
*  Maybe get some stem cells in there. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3637.2000000000003s)]
*  That's probably what I need to do for sure. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3638.64s)]
*  But you don't know what the injury is. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3640.44s)]
*  It's just a, what is it? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3642.28s)]
*  Loose cap? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3645.36s)]
*  Loose cap? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3646.68s)]
*  Maybe just your knee needs exercise. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3648.4s)]
*  It's like some knees over toes guy shit. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3650.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was supposed to go to a lot of physical therapy [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3652.56s)]
*  and build it up the knee muscle, but. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3655.28s)]
*  You were supposed to. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3658.12s)]
*  I had physical therapy is the worst. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3659.8s)]
*  Well, it's necessary, right? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3662.76s)]
*  You get an injury, they help you rehabilitate it. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3666.0s)]
*  I went to it once, I was just like, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3668.2s)]
*  all right, now sit on this bed, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3669.6s)]
*  and I just want you to bend. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3670.92s)]
*  We're gonna do this 200 times. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3672.76s)]
*  Why am I paying for this? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3674.8s)]

*  I don't want that. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3677.8s)]
*  What do you want them to do? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3678.64s)]
*  You put electrodes on it and just zap it, make it right? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3680.08s)]
*  Put some stem cells in there. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3682.52s)]
*  And then. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3683.88s)]
*  How often do you work out? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3686.36s)]
*  I don't right now. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3688.04s)]
*  At all, zero. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3689.0s)]
*  No, zero. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3689.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3690.68s)]
*  Zero workout. Probably should do a little, huh? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3691.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3692.64s)]
*  Maybe just walk. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3693.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I do that. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3694.92s)]
*  Yeah, but like walk around your neighborhood. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3696.28s)]
*  Yeah, I do that, like walk the dogs and stuff like that. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3697.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3700.32s)]
*  That's definitely better than nothing. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3701.16s)]
*  Walking is one of the best ways to burn fat too. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3702.96s)]
*  People go on long walks, like slow, steady walk. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3705.68s)]
*  Like a lot of guys that are trying to get ripped, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3709.12s)]
*  they'll spend like an hour and a half every day just walking. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3711.12s)]
*  It's like a slow fat burn. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3713.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3715.88s)]
*  Guys are trying to get ripped. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3717.56s)]
*  My neighborhood has bobcats in it though. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3719.16s)]
*  So like, I don't like walking my dog right now. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3720.68s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3723.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a whole family. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3724.12s)]
*  And like, there's four of them, five of them. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3724.9599999999996s)]
*  And. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3727.72s)]
*  They probably wouldn't try to snatch your dog. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3728.56s)]
*  Coyotes would though. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3731.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3732.56s)]
*  You see that video of the coyote trying to [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3733.3999999999996s)]
*  snatch that kid in Woodland Hills? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3734.24s)]
*  Yeah, they ended up finding it and killing it. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3735.4399999999996s)]
*  That poor little baby has to get rabies shots [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3737.7999999999997s)]
*  and shit like that. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3739.9599999999996s)]

*  Yeah, because she actually got bit. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3741.64s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3743.8s)]
*  It probably didn't have rabies though. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3745.96s)]
*  It was just acting like a predator. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3747.6400000000003s)]
*  You see the raccoon? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3749.0800000000004s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3750.2000000000003s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3751.04s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3753.8s)]

*  that there's a disease, just like that rage thing [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3756.0800000000004s)]
*  from Planet of the Apes, there's a disease that makes [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3758.28s)]
*  you aggressive so that you can give it to someone else. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3761.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3764.0s)]
*  Well, you bite them and then they have it. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3764.84s)]
*  And it's fatal to people. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3766.2000000000003s)]
*  Like 99% of the time when people get rabies, they're dead. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3768.2400000000002s)]

*  Let's just see, are raccoons related to bears? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3870.48s)]
*  Probably live two to three years. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3873.4s)]
*  That's it? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3875.48s)]
*  Probably rough tumble of life out there [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3877.2000000000003s)]
*  eating out of garbage cans. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3878.96s)]
*  Raccoons and bears belong in the same clade [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3880.36s)]
*  of carnivorous mammals, but they're not small bears. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3883.7200000000003s)]
*  Their physique is similar to that of a bear [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3887.28s)]
*  and they're both predators, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3889.8s)]
*  but the similarity is only due to their adaptation [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3891.12s)]
*  to a comparable way of life [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3893.56s)]
*  and why I struggle with comparable. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3896.68s)]
*  So they're in the same clade of carnivorous mammals. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3899.0s)]
*  What's the closest relative to a raccoon? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3902.92s)]
*  Click on that. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3904.6s)]
*  Red panda is close, considered to a distant cousin [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3905.44s)]
*  of a North American raccoon. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3908.04s)]
*  Ah, look at that. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3908.88s)]
*  See what it says, what's the closest relative? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3909.7999999999997s)]
*  Ring-tailed cats. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3912.84s)]
*  Oh, I saw one of those the other day in Texas. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3914.4s)]
*  They're cool looking, man. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3916.6s)]
*  It was running across the road. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3918.08s)]
*  I'm like, wow, look at that. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3919.0s)]
*  Animals are fucking cool, man. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3921.64s)]
*  It's cool to be around them and see them and shit. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3923.2799999999997s)]
*  Except bunny rabbits. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3926.88s)]
*  I fucking hate bunny rabbits. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3928.12s)]
*  How was Avatar? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3929.44s)]
*  You said it was good. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3930.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3931.4s)]
*  Good, great. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3932.24s)]
*  Why are all these people saying it's bad? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3933.08s)]
*  They have bad taste and like weird stuff. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3933.92s)]
*  I have a friend that works in Hollywood. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3937.04s)]
*  He does CGI for movies and stuff like that [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3939.2799999999997s)]
*  and he got to see an early screening of it [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3943.92s)]
*  and he said the audience he was with, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3946.0s)]
*  everyone was bored out of their mind, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3947.72s)]
*  people were walking out. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3948.92s)]
*  He said he hated it and I was like, what the fuck? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3949.92s)]
*  And then another friend of mine has seen it twice [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3952.8s)]
*  and he's like, this is great. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3955.04s)]
*  I don't know what to believe now. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3957.0s)]
*  Was your friend in Hollywood that hated it? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3958.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3960.76s)]
*  I think it might be one of those things [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3961.6s)]
*  where you're supposed to hate it. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3962.44s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3963.48s)]
*  There's some things you're supposed to hate. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3964.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3965.48s)]
*  I just want to see it. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3967.96s)]
*  But it sucks I have to go to the movie theater [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3968.8s)]
*  because I have to see the 3D on that one, right? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3970.28s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3972.56s)]
*  I don't think you have to. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3973.4s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3974.2400000000002s)]
*  Why would you not? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3975.36s)]
*  Remember how good the 3D was though last? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3976.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, that's what half of it is. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3978.04s)]
*  This is a 3D experience. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3979.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, otherwise you're just watching stuff happen [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3980.7200000000003s)]
*  and it's like the story is not good enough without 3D. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3983.0s)]
*  It's like the first one, it was a pretty vanilla story. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3986.52s)]
*  I love the first story though. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3989.96s)]
*  It had a bunch of cool shit to see. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3990.8s)]
*  I mean, it was definitely a derivative story, right? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3992.2400000000002s)]
*  It was like Pocahontas they called it. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3995.2400000000002s)]
*  There was just multiple times in the movie I'm watching [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3997.1600000000003s)]
*  and I'm like, I can't believe all of this is fake. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=3998.96s)]
*  This is all CGI, none of this was real. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4002.2400000000002s)]
*  In the new one? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4004.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, just like, they didn't go to a planet [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4005.0800000000004s)]
*  and film it in water. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4007.76s)]
*  This is all fake shit. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4009.0800000000004s)]
*  Now did you see it in like 4D or any of the crazy stuff? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4010.0s)]
*  No, I saw it, there's like a MX 4D thing [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4012.76s)]
*  and there is a 48 frames per second version, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4015.0800000000004s)]
*  like a high speed. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4017.1600000000003s)]
*  Ooh, what? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4018.0s)]
*  I don't know what makes that different. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4018.84s)]
*  I don't know if they're even showing that in Austin. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4019.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4021.44s)]
*  In LA I looked, you can definitely see that [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4022.28s)]
*  multiple places in LA. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4023.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4024.1600000000003s)]
*  They did film a lot of it underwater [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4026.0s)]
*  because they said Kate Winslet held her breath [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4027.8s)]
*  for seven minutes. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4029.6800000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4031.2000000000003s)]
*  How is that possible? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4032.88s)]
*  She's just really good at holding her breath. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4033.92s)]
*  I think it's a mental thing. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4035.6000000000004s)]
*  I think, you know, my friend Remy Warren, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4036.76s)]
*  he did this show a while back, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4040.32s)]
*  it was called Apex Predator [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4043.44s)]
*  and he would learn about all these different predators [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4045.32s)]
*  and what skillset they used to try to hunt their prey [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4048.6400000000003s)]
*  and in one of them they were doing octopuses or octopi [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4053.48s)]
*  and they were doing some stuff in the water [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4057.2400000000002s)]
*  and he had to try to hold his breath [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4059.1600000000003s)]
*  for as long as he could [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4061.28s)]
*  and they taught him how to do it [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4062.7200000000003s)]
*  and the first time he did it, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4063.5600000000004s)]
*  he had to do it for normal people, like two minutes [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4064.4s)]
*  but there's these techniques that you can use [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4067.48s)]
*  and they'll let you know that you're just, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4070.0s)]
*  this is like a panic response [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4071.92s)]
*  and you don't really need to come up [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4073.56s)]
*  out of the water right now [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4075.08s)]
*  and if you learn to stay calm, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4076.2000000000003s)]
*  you can stay in the water far longer [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4077.76s)]
*  than you think you can. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4079.2000000000003s)]
*  Wow, that makes sense. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4080.04s)]
*  Avatar star Kate Winslet thought she died [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4081.4s)]
*  breaking Tom Cruise's record. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4085.2400000000002s)]
*  What? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4086.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I think Sigourney Weaver did it too [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4087.8s)]
*  and Sigourney Weaver is in her 70s. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4091.08s)]
*  Seven minutes and 15 seconds. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4093.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4096.6s)]
*  And Cruise's record was for Mission Impossible [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4097.5199999999995s)]
*  Rogue Nation was six minutes. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4100.72s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4102.6s)]
*  Try harder, Tom. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4103.44s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4104.64s)]
*  She had a video of her surfacing saying, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4105.64s)]
*  am I dead, have I died? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4107.84s)]
*  And then going, what was my time? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4109.5599999999995s)]
*  She shared. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4111.48s)]
*  She said, I couldn't believe it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4112.5199999999995s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4113.96s)]
*  I wonder if you had a clock down there, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4115.28s)]
*  you could do it longer. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4116.64s)]
*  Why did she have to do it though, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4117.48s)]
*  just for the special effect of her like floating [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4118.48s)]
*  or something like that? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4120.4s)]
*  I don't think there's a special effect. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4121.24s)]
*  I think there's a lot of times where they're filming stuff [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4122.24s)]
*  actually underwater and the more time [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4124.44s)]
*  you could hold your breath, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4126.92s)]
*  the more time you could be underwater. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4127.88s)]
*  So she's doing this. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4129.4s)]
*  So she's doing stuff where she's actually underwater. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4130.8s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4134.5599999999995s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4135.48s)]
*  But no matter what her character she is, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4136.32s)]
*  it doesn't look like Kate Winslet. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4138.12s)]
*  I couldn't tell that was her. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4139.76s)]
*  I had to look afterwards and like, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4141.0s)]
*  holy shit, Kate Winslet. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4141.84s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4142.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, I guess if you're really looking real hard, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4143.599999999999s)]
*  you can tell. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4145.28s)]
*  But is she like an Avatar creature? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4146.12s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4147.88s)]
*  So like, so they did with Sigourney Weaver [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4150.36s)]
*  which shot spoiler alert. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4152.96s)]
*  This isn't a spoiler. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4153.96s)]
*  It's like all Avatars. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4154.8s)]
*  There's very few like humans in the movie. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4155.84s)]
*  But isn't the bad guy back the fucking, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4157.64s)]
*  how do they get him back? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4160.48s)]
*  Not talking about that. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4161.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4162.16s)]
*  See the movie? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4163.0s)]
*  Is Fleshlight making a new Avatar Fleshlight? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4163.84s)]
*  Remember the Avatar Fleshlight? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4167.48s)]
*  That was my favorite. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4168.5599999999995s)]
*  That was, so Avatar was 2009. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4169.84s)]
*  And think about how much better the CGI has got. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4172.4s)]
*  And Avatar 1 was fucking dope. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4174.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4176.76s)]
*  But how much better is the CGI now? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4177.599999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna see it. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4179.2s)]
*  Let's see it this weekend maybe. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4180.88s)]
*  You're gonna have to just buckle up and go to the movies. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4182.44s)]
*  Did you go to IMAX? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4185.08s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't technically an IMAX screen [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4186.8s)]
*  but I've looked around Austin. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4188.76s)]
*  There's not, there's one I've seen [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4189.88s)]
*  which is like on the Texas Campus Theater. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4192.24s)]
*  It is like a legit, gigantic, huge, real IMAX screen. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4194.16s)]
*  But the rest of it is tough. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4197.64s)]
*  Yeah, I lived next to one of those XD ones [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4200.68s)]
*  where the whole thing's moving and shit. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4204.36s)]
*  I'll never do that again. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4206.4s)]
*  Haptic feedback. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4207.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, after a while it's so fucking annoying. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4208.36s)]
*  You just like stop. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4210.44s)]
*  And then it's scary too [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4211.839999999999s)]
*  because if something pops out, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4213.36s)]
*  the whole seat is gonna go boom like that. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4216.28s)]
*  And so you go, oh! [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4217.92s)]
*  Like it almost gives you a heart attack. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4218.759999999999s)]
*  Like you think you just got hit by something. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4220.12s)]
*  Imagine if you were doing that [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4222.96s)]
*  but you were doing that for like [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4224.44s)]
*  some kind of fucking crazy racing movie. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4226.799999999999s)]
*  And the seats go side to side when you're doing it. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4230.08s)]
*  That's how it was. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4233.04s)]
*  I saw that stupid light year movie. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4233.88s)]
*  And so during flying things and stuff like that. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4237.28s)]
*  What is light year? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4239.36s)]
*  The Pixar movie, the one with Buzz Lightyear. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4241.0s)]
*  Oh, that's the one where they replaced Tim Allen [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4244.4s)]
*  because he believes in Jesus. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4246.679999999999s)]
*  Why'd they get rid of Tim Allen? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4250.2s)]
*  That is the weirdest thing that they did that. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4251.76s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4253.76s)]
*  They did it because of his political beliefs? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4254.599999999999s)]
*  I think they did it for the price. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4256.24s)]
*  Clever Brian. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4259.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4260.599999999999s)]
*  You might be right. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4261.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4263.12s)]
*  What a good way to force him out [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4263.96s)]
*  and get a little money on the budget. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4264.96s)]
*  It's not like, I mean, he played a younger version [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4267.280000000001s)]
*  or a different version of him. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4270.0s)]
*  Where Tim Allen played the toy of the character. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4271.8s)]
*  And so that's why I think they also did it [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4275.8s)]
*  because it's not supposed to be the same person. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4278.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's just gonna be like a version of that person. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4280.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4283.96s)]
*  That means it sucked. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4285.72s)]
*  Also with this Tim Allen thing, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4286.64s)]
*  excuse me, with this Morgan Freeman thing rather. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4288.88s)]
*  I wonder if they could do the Tim Allen thing with that. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4291.0s)]
*  Like they don't even need you anymore. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4294.04s)]
*  Oh, that's what I told you. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4295.240000000001s)]
*  They did that with Bruce Willis [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4296.12s)]
*  because he lost the way to can't talk. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4297.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4300.32s)]
*  So they've deep faked him into at least one commercial [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4301.16s)]
*  so far. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4302.84s)]
*  Oh yeah, he signed off all his lights and stuff. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4303.68s)]
*  That's crazy, he can't talk. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4305.8s)]
*  Fuck, how do we fix Bruce Willis? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4307.36s)]
*  I know. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4309.12s)]
*  I used to love that dude from Moonlighting. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4310.44s)]
*  I loved that show. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4312.2s)]
*  Moonlighting and Die Hard. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4313.04s)]
*  Tell us back in the day when you couldn't record things, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4314.76s)]
*  you had to be there when it happened, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4316.5599999999995s)]
*  whatever night it was on. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4318.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4320.0s)]
*  This is not Bruce Willis. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4320.84s)]

*  Russian? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4333.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that says Russian deep fake for him, yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4334.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4337.58s)]
*  They've been doing that with Biden for the last four months. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4340.06s)]
*  People thought that Trump NFT thing was fake for three days. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=4343.1s)]

*  And then it was sold for $115,000 or credit. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5621.620000000001s)]

*  where they can genetically engineer life forms [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5673.26s)]
*  that really didn't exist before, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5676.1s)]
*  how long before someone makes that? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5677.5s)]
*  Makes some guy with a nose that's a dick [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5679.1s)]

*  Like usually it could be like, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5693.860000000001s)]
*  oh, I see what the artist was saying. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5695.58s)]

*  Maybe that's part of the art, I don't know. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5722.18s)]
*  People have always been fucked. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5723.46s)]

*  and this is a thing, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5737.06s)]
*  because if you bring up like elite people [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5737.9800000000005s)]
*  that are molesting children, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5741.38s)]

*  Maybe there's only a couple of them. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5769.5s)]
*  Maybe there's a network of them though, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5770.66s)]
*  because it seems like they have exposed networks [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5773.42s)]
*  of people doing stuff like that in the past. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5775.98s)]
*  We just don't wanna admit it, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5778.66s)]
*  because it's so horrific. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5779.58s)]
*  So we don't wanna look at it. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5780.5s)]
*  And you don't wanna say it out loud. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5781.34s)]
*  Because if you say it out loud, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5782.82s)]
*  all of a sudden you're a kook [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5783.7s)]
*  and you're a conspiracy theorist. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5784.94s)]
*  But what if it is actually happening? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5786.62s)]
*  And your inability to even entertain the thought [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5788.62s)]
*  that it could be possibly happening. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5793.98s)]
*  And this is sort of like a group think thing [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5795.94s)]
*  that happens with all of us. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5799.14s)]
*  We really wanna entertain it. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5800.18s)]
*  And because we don't wanna entertain it, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5801.66s)]
*  it doesn't get brought up. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5803.94s)]
*  It's not like a thing that's like at the forefront [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5805.24s)]
*  of everybody's conversation, [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5807.42s)]
*  until something like this Balenciaga thing happens. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5808.54s)]
*  And you hear a bunch of different versions of it. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5811.0599999999995s)]
*  Like who did what? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5813.099999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5813.98s)]
*  Well, I heard it was just a designer. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5814.86s)]
*  Or I heard it was just a publicist [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5816.82s)]
*  that did that. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5819.18s)]
*  And she had some wacky shit on her site, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5820.0s)]
*  but it had nothing to do with the company. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5821.82s)]
*  And then there's. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=5825.3s)]

*  Let me explain. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6172.06s)]
*  Yes, I get that you sing along with this [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6173.1s)]
*  when you hear it on commercials, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6176.38s)]
*  during the old school lunch breaks, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6178.620000000001s)]
*  and at grown and sexy social scenes, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6180.22s)]
*  but Marvin was up to no good when he wrote it. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6183.34s)]
*  When he recorded it, he was dating Janis Hunter. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6185.860000000001s)]
*  Okay, he was dating a girl Janis was 17. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6188.5s)]
*  Okay, but how do you know the doubt? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6192.7s)]
*  So they're not saying that he wrote that song about her. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6195.06s)]
*  I read it so quickly, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6198.3s)]
*  I thought that's what I was seeing with all this. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6199.18s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6200.78s)]
*  I doubt he was only dating Janis. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6202.86s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6207.1s)]
*  Let's be realistic, he was Marvin motherfucking gay. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6209.18s)]
*  Back then, that guy was the man. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6213.54s)]
*  He probably had to fight them off. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6217.18s)]
*  I mean, women are probably showing up at his house every day. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6220.38s)]
*  He would sing about fucking. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6223.02s)]
*  Let's Get It On. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6225.5s)]
*  He died in Hollywood, right? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6228.7s)]
*  His father killed him. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6230.02s)]
*  Yeah, he had a jealous father. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6231.1s)]
*  Girl, you'll be a woman soon. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6233.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6247.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6248.78s)]
*  They didn't sing that version though, in Pulp Fiction. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6249.62s)]
*  He didn't. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6250.82s)]
*  Burt Kill, Burt Kill did. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6252.66s)]

*  That song's fucking amazing. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6262.82s)]
*  I remember reading, I dated this girl when I hear this, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6265.7s)]
*  this is crazy. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6268.0199999999995s)]
*  I was really into Marvin Gaye for a while [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6271.7s)]
*  when I was like 21, and I was dating this girl [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6275.22s)]
*  when she was 25. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6276.78s)]
*  And then I read that Marvin Gaye's dad killed him. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6278.86s)]
*  And I was like, fuck. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6284.34s)]
*  And she goes, do you know how much of a horrible person [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6286.14s)]
*  he must have been that his dad killed him? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6288.14s)]
*  Wow, yeah. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6290.7s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6293.38s)]
*  But see, this woman that I was dating [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6295.26s)]
*  had a great relationship with her dad. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6297.5s)]
*  Her dad was a great guy, she loved her dad. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6299.62s)]
*  So she would never associate a father [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6302.18s)]
*  with being someone who would abuse you. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6304.26s)]
*  I grew up without my dad. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6307.38s)]

*  His dad was probably jealous. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6311.860000000001s)]
*  His dad was probably just some terrible, [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6312.9400000000005s)]
*  there's terrible people that fuck people and have kids. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6314.3s)]

*  To me, he looks like, you know, he could be 20. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6395.58s)]
*  He could be 19. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6398.54s)]
*  He looks young. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6399.58s)]
*  He's real skinny. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6400.419999999999s)]
*  And the father's kind of jacked. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6401.54s)]
*  Not too jacked, but you know, he's fit. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6402.94s)]
*  And he could fucking punch. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6405.62s)]
*  He knows how to box. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6407.219999999999s)]
*  And the son doesn't look like he has any idea [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6408.54s)]
*  what the fuck he's doing. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6410.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the thing was. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6411.94s)]
*  Someone sent it to me. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6414.0599999999995s)]
*  And they were cheering that this old guy knocked his son out. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6415.179999999999s)]
*  I was like, you guys are crazy. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6418.0199999999995s)]
*  You failed. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6420.66s)]
*  You failed as a man. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6421.74s)]
*  Yeah, this is it. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6423.219999999999s)]
*  That's not exactly what was happening. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6424.179999999999s)]
*  It's not? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6425.74s)]
*  What is it? [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6426.58s)]
*  They're not father-son. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6427.419999999999s)]
*  Oh, why does it lie? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6428.259999999999s)]
*  It says father knocks out son in a celebrity boxing match. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6429.339999999999s)]
*  I gotta get somebody to click on this. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6431.74s)]
*  This was like a YouTuber thing. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6433.74s)]
*  This guy's a YouTuber and he's a YouTuber. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6434.94s)]
*  I'm such a sucker. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6437.179999999999s)]
*  They got me. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6438.54s)]
*  I hate that shit. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6439.379999999999s)]
*  Okay, now I'm not sad anymore. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6440.219999999999s)]
*  Now I'm like, fuck yeah, old guy who fucked up [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6441.86s)]
*  that young punk who's talking shit about him. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6444.46s)]
*  If that was actually his son, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6446.9s)]
*  that would be the saddest shit of all time. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6448.9s)]
*  Because if you're a guy and you can box like that, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6450.82s)]
*  you can punch like that, you've been boxing. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6453.0599999999995s)]
*  So you know people that have brain damage. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6455.7s)]
*  You know the consequences of getting punched in the face. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6457.9s)]
*  But if it's just some cocky kid who wants to box [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6460.66s)]
*  with some dude, I'm all in. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6463.54s)]
*  YouTuber. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6464.82s)]
*  So now I'm in. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6465.66s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6466.58s)]
*  Just all about the relationship [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6467.82s)]
*  the two people have with each other. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6469.299999999999s)]
*  I want love whenever possible. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6472.26s)]
*  But sometimes people talk shit [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6473.38s)]
*  and they need to get cracked. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6476.42s)]
*  Here's the guy walking out. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6477.7s)]
*  He's ready to roll. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6478.7s)]
*  Yeah, look at him with the tie. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6479.7s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6481.1s)]
*  He's 42. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6481.98s)]
*  You know he's on testosterone. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6483.58s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6485.0599999999995s)]
*  But the thing is, it's like he actually knows [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6485.9s)]
*  how to box a little bit. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6487.66s)]
*  Like this guy knows he's in trouble. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6489.7s)]
*  You can tell. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6491.3s)]
*  Like from the very beginning, he looks nervous as fuck. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6492.14s)]
*  And that other dude looks super confident. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6494.5s)]
*  That's how a lot of these have gone. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6496.94s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6498.1s)]
*  It says daddy on his chest. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6499.62s)]
*  I guess that's probably a joke [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6502.34s)]
*  because it doesn't look like a real tattoo. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6503.18s)]
*  Why don't you give us the full screen so we can see it. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6504.46s)]
*  Dad feels is the guy's name. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6506.3s)]
*  That's his name? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6507.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6509.1s)]
*  This is like his Twitch account. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6509.94s)]
*  So these are Twitch guys? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6511.06s)]
*  YouTuber, this is on his account. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6513.18s)]
*  It's dad. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6514.9s)]
*  I like how he goes full bald too. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6516.9800000000005s)]
*  Bald spot, goofy hair in the front. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6518.78s)]
*  Just looks stupid when you beat his ass. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6520.7s)]
*  Look at him, dancing around. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6523.26s)]
*  I like it. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6526.02s)]
*  Look how confident he is. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6526.86s)]
*  But then once the fight starts, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6528.94s)]
*  you realize why he's confident [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6530.54s)]
*  because he actually knows how to box. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6532.06s)]
*  Just look at the body difference. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6534.18s)]
*  Dude's way more jacked also. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6537.06s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6539.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, oh, yes. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6539.86s)]
*  He can actually punch a little bit. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6541.34s)]
*  I mean, he definitely doesn't look like a serious boxer, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6542.9s)]
*  but he's throwing some fucking haymakers [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6545.7s)]
*  and he's landing them. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6547.46s)]
*  He's digging to the body, like right there. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6548.66s)]
*  That was great. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6550.74s)]
*  Oh. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6552.94s)]
*  Stop the fight, stop the fight. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6553.78s)]
*  Stop it, stop it. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6554.62s)]
*  I mean, he got fucked up. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6555.86s)]
*  That other dude had no business being in there. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6557.5s)]
*  Now I understand why he's so happy. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6559.14s)]
*  That was awesome. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6560.58s)]
*  Okay, now it's better. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6561.42s)]
*  Isn't it funny? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6562.660000000001s)]
*  I was just a little bit of information. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6563.5s)]
*  Now you know more. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6565.14s)]
*  Now you know more about the situation. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6566.820000000001s)]
*  You're like, oh, I'm all in. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6568.34s)]
*  Yeah, looking at that and thinking [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6570.26s)]
*  that was a real father-son, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6571.5s)]
*  that would have freaked me out. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6572.820000000001s)]
*  Made me sad. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6574.02s)]
*  Thought it was a real father-son. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6575.26s)]
*  These fucking titles should be illegal. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6577.26s)]
*  What is YouTube doing to stop misinformation? [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6578.9800000000005s)]
*  What is YouTube doing? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6582.820000000001s)]
*  What are you doing to stop misinformation? [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6583.660000000001s)]
*  That's real misinformation, YouTube. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6585.900000000001s)]
*  That's how we clicked on it. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6588.3s)]
*  It was like 42 year old guy beats up young guy. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6589.46s)]
*  I'm not interested. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6591.860000000001s)]
*  My favorite is this old boxer. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6592.78s)]
*  And he looks like he's fucking 65. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6595.9400000000005s)]
*  And he's got a sweater on. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6598.78s)]
*  And he beats the shit out of this young jack guy. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6600.1s)]
*  They start boxing. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6604.02s)]
*  And all of a sudden this guy starts bobbing his head. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6605.06s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, this old guy can fight. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6606.74s)]

*  No. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6610.22s)]
*  So look at the young guy, jacked. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6611.04s)]
*  Heartthrob, man bun. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6612.22s)]

*  Right? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6615.42s)]
*  So he's smiling. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6616.34s)]
*  He thinks this is funny. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6617.3s)]
*  Look at, hey, okay, you want a box? [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6618.58s)]
*  All right, bro. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6620.46s)]
*  So he touches gloves with this guy. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6621.52s)]
*  Look at the guy with the sweater on. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6623.18s)]
*  But watch this. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6625.14s)]
*  The guy starts punching himself in the face [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6625.9800000000005s)]
*  and moving forward. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6627.38s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6628.66s)]
*  Look at him, head movement. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6629.5s)]
*  The guy should be nervous right now. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6630.54s)]
*  Oh, oh wow. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6632.38s)]
*  Look at this old guy. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6633.58s)]
*  Beats the brakes off this guy. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6634.42s)]
*  Drops him with a fucking left haymaker. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6636.26s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6638.54s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6639.46s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6640.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6641.74s)]
*  And then he's like, hey, fine, fine, fine, fine. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6642.58s)]
*  Fine, fine, fine. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6644.9400000000005s)]
*  He puts his hands up. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6645.78s)]
*  Why is he not enough? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6646.62s)]
*  It's like Rocky's coach. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6648.54s)]
*  What is he saying? [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6650.22s)]
*  What language is it? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6651.0599999999995s)]
*  Let me hear him talk again. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6651.88s)]
*  Back it up a little, because he's talking to those guys. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6652.86s)]
*  Can't. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6654.66s)]
*  It's a short. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6655.48s)]
*  Oh, they're Italian. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6656.32s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6657.16s)]
*  Is it, they're Italian? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6658.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6658.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6659.78s)]
*  Get in there, Rocky. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6662.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6666.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6668.3s)]
*  There's a lot of old men in Italy [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6669.3s)]
*  that'll punch you in the face. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6670.46s)]
*  Be careful. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6672.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6673.16s)]
*  But that's better, right? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6674.0s)]
*  That was even better. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6674.9s)]
*  Because that way the guy's older, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6676.660000000001s)]
*  so he's an actual grown, full man. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6677.700000000001s)]
*  He looks like he's in his 30s. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6679.700000000001s)]
*  He's jacked. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6681.160000000001s)]
*  He's not a little kid. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6682.1s)]
*  And the old guy's a beast. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6683.26s)]
*  Just seeing him like this, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6685.9400000000005s)]
*  and then start bobbing and waving, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6686.780000000001s)]
*  you're like, oh no. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6688.06s)]
*  That's so cool. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6689.34s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6690.18s)]
*  I want more of that. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6691.0s)]
*  If you don't know how to box, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6691.84s)]
*  and you're like, oh, oh, oh, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6692.9800000000005s)]
*  and you see that guy doing that, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6694.46s)]
*  that's a fucking terrible place to be. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6695.4800000000005s)]
*  And the fact that he had a man button too really helped. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6697.820000000001s)]
*  It helps a lot. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6699.860000000001s)]
*  And he's jacked, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6701.26s)]
*  and he's got a sleeveless shirt on. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6702.1s)]
*  It's showing the guns. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6704.26s)]
*  And he gets lit up. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6706.9800000000005s)]
*  You guys are really hitting on man buns. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6707.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6708.660000000001s)]
*  I've been trying to get you to shave your head for years, son. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6709.5s)]
*  You don't do the man bun thing, do you? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6712.14s)]
*  He does, like a samurai. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6713.740000000001s)]
*  Well, you don't do it on, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6714.660000000001s)]
*  that's a ponytail. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6715.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't do that messy bun all tied up on top. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6718.26s)]
*  That's a strange thing. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6720.860000000001s)]
*  That's either you're a samurai, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6723.02s)]
*  or you're a male feminist. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6724.740000000001s)]
*  One of the two. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6728.26s)]
*  The first guy I ever saw have that though, [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6729.780000000001s)]
*  it was pretty cool. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6731.780000000001s)]
*  It was Hicks and Gracie. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6732.700000000001s)]
*  Hicks and Gracie did it because he was into samurais. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6734.06s)]
*  Like he grew his hair out long, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6736.740000000001s)]
*  and he had it back there like a fucking samurai. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6738.5s)]
*  Back when he was the man. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6740.860000000001s)]
*  There's a video, see if you find Hicks and Gracie, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6743.820000000001s)]
*  yeah, look. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6747.38s)]
*  So he had a man bun, but this is when he was, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6748.22s)]
*  is that Cron? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6752.18s)]
*  That's Cron, that's his son. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6753.02s)]
*  That's his son there too. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6755.700000000001s)]
*  But there's, Hicks and had that way back in the day. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6756.9800000000005s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6760.18s)]
*  See if you can find the images of Hicks and Gracie back, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6761.02s)]
*  Hicks and back in the day was a goddamn heartthrob. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6762.74s)]
*  Look at him there doing yoga. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6764.66s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6766.179999999999s)]
*  Imagine that guy likes your lady. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6767.58s)]
*  You got real problems son. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6768.94s)]
*  Look how beautiful he was. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6770.66s)]
*  No disrespect, Mr. Gracie. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6772.38s)]
*  Just complimentary. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6774.38s)]
*  He's a, he was the greatest of all time. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6775.7s)]
*  In his day, no one came close. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6778.66s)]
*  They always, if you ask any jujitsu black belt, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6780.9s)]
*  who's the best, they all said Hicks and. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6783.26s)]
*  Now they all say Gordon Ryan, which is true of today. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6785.54s)]
*  But Gordon Ryan is like the modern version of Hicks and, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6788.46s)]
*  where everybody just says he's the best. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6790.7s)]
*  There's nobody like either one of those guys. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6792.78s)]
*  There's nobody like Hicks and, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6795.38s)]
*  and there's nobody like Gordon, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6796.62s)]
*  where everybody says that's the best. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6798.139999999999s)]
*  Who was the guy that you had on your show [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6800.38s)]
*  and I was there and he was like a master, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6803.26s)]
*  kind of like an older guy [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6805.98s)]
*  and he was putting me in choke holds and stuff. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6807.58s)]
*  Gene LaBelle. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6809.34s)]
*  Yeah, that dude. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6810.179999999999s)]
*  Judo Gene LaBelle, he passed away. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6811.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6812.22s)]
*  Rest in peace, he was the best. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6813.0599999999995s)]
*  He was the best. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6814.54s)]
*  He was such a funny guy. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6815.38s)]
*  And he was one of the first guys that ever invented [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6816.66s)]
*  entered into a mixed fight. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6820.42s)]
*  A fight with a karate guy. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6822.5s)]
*  No, he fought a boxer. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6824.54s)]
*  I think he did several of them, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6825.94s)]
*  but there's a video of him. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6827.139999999999s)]
*  He's wearing his judo gi and he fights a boxer [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6828.62s)]
*  and just smothers his boxer and strangles him. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6831.58s)]
*  But it was one of the first times that you'd ever seen [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6834.22s)]
*  mixed martial arts fights. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6836.98s)]
*  So he was one of the first mixed, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6838.34s)]
*  mixed combat sports athletes. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6840.139999999999s)]
*  And so he has this fight with a guy [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6842.42s)]
*  and he wears the judo gi and just, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6845.34s)]
*  he was a legitimate national champion in judo. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6847.3s)]
*  Gene LaBelle was the fucking man. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6851.18s)]
*  So this is like 63. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6852.860000000001s)]
*  And he made the boxer wear a judo gi, which is hilarious. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6854.900000000001s)]
*  But it looks like the boxer has little tiny gloves on too. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6858.74s)]
*  It looks like he's got kind of MMA gloves. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6861.74s)]
*  Milo Savage, that's the guy he fought. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6864.7s)]
*  And the guy was a serious boxer too, [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6866.54s)]
*  you could tell just by, no, don't go too far. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6867.900000000001s)]
*  I didn't do anything. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6870.06s)]
*  He just did that? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6870.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's cheap. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6871.74s)]
*  So it just shows Gene on top of him. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6873.54s)]
*  It doesn't show the takedown in this particular video [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6875.26s)]
*  that we're watching, but Gene cornered him. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6878.1s)]
*  He cornered him and grabbed him, got ahold of him. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6879.02s)]
*  But like, you see what the way this guy boxes, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6881.34s)]
*  like he's got some serious punches. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6883.26s)]
*  You can tell even by the way he's moving, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6884.820000000001s)]
*  like that's a real boxer. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6887.22s)]
*  But he made him wear that fucking gi, man. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6889.14s)]
*  If you make him wear that kimono top, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6891.820000000001s)]
*  even if the guy is trying to punch Gene LaBelle, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6894.06s)]
*  Gene is never letting go of that top. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6896.820000000001s)]
*  And he drags him to the ground, gets on top of him. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6898.62s)]
*  I think he choked him unconscious with his own gi. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6902.38s)]
*  I think that's what he did. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6905.22s)]
*  I don't really totally remember, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6907.74s)]
*  but look how good the guy keeps getting up, man. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6908.58s)]
*  He got up a couple of times. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6909.94s)]
*  So Milo Savage was a bad man. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6911.299999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like he was fighting some chump. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6913.139999999999s)]
*  He was just fighting a guy who, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6915.42s)]
*  that's how it doesn't show it, huh? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6917.86s)]
*  So it looks to me like he got him in an Ezekiel choke, [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6919.78s)]
*  which is a choke where you use the collar of your shirt. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6922.58s)]
*  It looks like that's what he's doing. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6926.74s)]
*  No, right here he's just pinning him. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6928.259999999999s)]
*  So there's the choke. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6929.74s)]
*  So I'm looking at it right now. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6930.82s)]
*  He, hard to say, probably some kind of a gi choke. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6932.26s)]
*  Some type of gi choke. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6939.54s)]
*  This is like Ezekiel is you grab your collar like this here. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6941.18s)]
*  You grab your own collar and then you put this [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6944.62s)]
*  across the person's face, across their neck rather, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6947.14s)]
*  and you strangle them with the gi. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6950.18s)]
*  So maybe he did that, but he was one of the first. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6954.58s)]
*  And he was a stunt man and he was the guy [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6957.3s)]
*  that allegedly choked out Steven Seagal on the set [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6959.74s)]
*  and made him go to the bathroom. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6963.54s)]
*  He explained it on the podcast. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6968.5s)]
*  It was a hilarious explanation. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6969.34s)]
*  That was a good podcast. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6971.0199999999995s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6972.0199999999995s)]
*  He almost killed me. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6972.86s)]
*  He also is a guy that taught Bruce Lee. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6973.679999999999s)]
*  When Bruce Lee met him, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6977.9s)]
*  he really didn't understand grappling like that, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6979.26s)]
*  like that kind of super high level judo. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6982.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think in that movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6984.5s)]
*  the Brad Pitt character is supposed to represent [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6988.62s)]
*  in some way, shape, or form a guy like Gene LaBelle, [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6991.58s)]
*  a guy who was like a real bad motherfucker [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6994.22s)]
*  who is working with Bruce Lee on a movie set. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6996.14s)]
*  But in reality, they collaborated. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=6998.22s)]
*  In reality, like Gene LaBelle taught him some judo, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7000.22s)]
*  but he did pick him up at one point in time [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7003.34s)]
*  and like carry him around. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7005.22s)]
*  Just to let him know, like, hey buddy, in the real world, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7006.66s)]
*  I'm fucking Gene LaBelle and you weigh 135 pounds. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7011.0199999999995s)]
*  But he taught him stuff. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7015.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why I believe it's Game of Death, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7016.66s)]
*  the one when they're fighting. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7018.86s)]
*  I think it's Game of Death. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7019.7s)]
*  He catches this guy that he's fighting with in an armbar. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7020.54s)]
*  It was like one of the first times, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7024.54s)]
*  and it was when he was wearing those Jeet Kune Do gloves, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7025.38s)]
*  which look a lot like modern MMA gloves. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7028.3s)]
*  They were like a little bit more puffy, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7030.74s)]
*  but that was like the first version of an MMA glove. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7032.3s)]
*  And he wins this fight with grappling, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7035.44s)]
*  which I guarantee Gene LaBelle had an influence on that. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7037.639999999999s)]
*  Because Bruce Lee was so fucking smart, man. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7041.22s)]
*  He said it was End of the Dragon. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7044.3s)]
*  End of the Dragon, that's right, sorry. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7045.3s)]
*  See those gloves? [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7047.26s)]
*  Look at those gloves. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7048.1s)]
*  So he's fighting this guy, cracks him, ducks under the kick, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7048.9400000000005s)]
*  takes him down, throws him to the ground. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7052.1s)]
*  I mean, you gotta understand that back then, [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7055.900000000001s)]
*  you might look at this today and see this kind of silly, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7058.900000000001s)]
*  back then, this was the shit. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7060.78s)]
*  Because Bruce Lee was, look at that kick. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7064.26s)]
*  He was a legit martial artist, like really good, [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7066.54s)]
*  and also a giant movie star, [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7069.820000000001s)]
*  and also a guy who is open-minded enough [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7072.1s)]
*  to incorporate all the arts into what he called Jeet Kune Do. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7076.26s)]
*  So he was like the first guy that figured out, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7080.740000000001s)]
*  look, he's throwing fucking takedowns, [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7083.34s)]
*  and Aikido, and Judo, and everything. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7085.42s)]
*  He threw it all in together. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7088.660000000001s)]
*  He's throwing this guy to the ground. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7089.900000000001s)]
*  He gets him in a fucking crucifix from the back, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7090.9400000000005s)]
*  and gets him in an arm bar, and makes the dude tap. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7094.740000000001s)]
*  He's tapping. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7098.46s)]
*  First time we ever see a tap. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7099.54s)]
*  That's true. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7100.86s)]
*  It's here, in Enter the Dragon, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7101.7s)]
*  and then they bow afterwards. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7104.0599999999995s)]
*  This is literally like an example for everybody to see [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7105.3s)]
*  of the first mixed martial arts fight, and it was Bruce Lee. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7108.22s)]
*  Because Bruce Lee, back then, [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7112.14s)]
*  even when I was training in Taekwondo, [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7114.22s)]
*  when I would go to Muay Thai gyms, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7115.94s)]
*  my instructor did not like it. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7117.86s)]
*  They did not like it. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7119.58s)]
*  When I would go to boxing gyms, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7120.9s)]
*  they're like, you can learn that here. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7122.26s)]
*  Everybody wanted you to just learn Taekwondo. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7123.62s)]
*  They opened their mind up to it a little bit [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7126.34s)]
*  at certain points in time. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7127.9800000000005s)]
*  Certain students that we had that also boxed, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7129.46s)]
*  I could go train with them in other places. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7131.9800000000005s)]
*  But when I started kickboxing, it was a giant wake-up call. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7133.780000000001s)]
*  Because I realized, wow, there's stuff that's better [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7137.34s)]
*  than Taekwondo for an overall... [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7139.26s)]
*  Taekwondo is the best for wild kicks, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7141.22s)]
*  side kicks, and front kicks, and wheel kicks, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7143.820000000001s)]
*  and turning back kicks, and shit like that. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7146.1s)]
*  But boxing is way better for your hands. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7147.780000000001s)]
*  Those guys are way better at it. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7150.42s)]
*  And then you get kicked in the legs, and you're like, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7151.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh boy, I need to learn that. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7154.0199999999995s)]
*  How do you kick? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7154.82s)]
*  Well, there's an art to that. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7155.66s)]
*  And then you learn takedowns. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7156.98s)]
*  You're like, oh Jesus, I'm helpless when I'm on my back. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7158.459999999999s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7161.099999999999s)]
*  You learn Jiu-Jitsu. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7161.94s)]
*  You're like, oh, I thought I was a badass. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7162.78s)]
*  I'm just a victim. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7164.459999999999s)]
*  Someone could just maul you. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7166.099999999999s)]
*  But Bruce Lee, he opened that door for everybody. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7167.259999999999s)]
*  Because back then, especially before the UFC, [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7170.5s)]
*  martial arts were very... [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7173.54s)]
*  Everybody stayed in their tribe. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7175.379999999999s)]
*  The Judo guys thought Judo was the best. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7178.0199999999995s)]
*  The kickboxing guys thought Judo was the best. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7180.78s)]
*  Kickboxer guys thought kickboxing was the best. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7183.5s)]
*  Everybody had their own mindset on what style was the best. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7185.900000000001s)]
*  Bruce Lee started it all off, bro. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7191.62s)]
*  And Judo Gene LeBell was the guy that taught him grappling. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7193.62s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7198.34s)]
*  He's got a head and arm choke, sort of. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7199.18s)]
*  I like the faces he always has. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7201.86s)]
*  Yeah, this is kind of a head and arm choke. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7203.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7205.900000000001s)]
*  Is that with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7206.74s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7208.86s)]
*  He's got... [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7209.7s)]
*  This dude has got him in an arm bar. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7210.54s)]
*  What movie was that? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7212.86s)]
*  Interesting, he's got his thumb the wrong way. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7216.78s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7218.22s)]
*  Bruce Lee orders cocaine? [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7219.0599999999995s)]
*  Robert Baker. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7221.22s)]
*  Oh, he sidekicks him to the face, [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7223.179999999999s)]
*  then he pulls his hair and fucking karate chops him [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7225.34s)]
*  in the neck for the death. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7227.54s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7231.0199999999995s)]
*  Back then, man, everybody wanted to learn karate. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7232.5s)]
*  When they saw that Bruce Lee movie, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7235.54s)]
*  everybody wanted to learn kung fu. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7236.78s)]
*  Dudes started walking around with kung fu outfits on. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7238.5s)]
*  Guys who go to school with kung fu outfits on back then. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7241.22s)]
*  He also probably helped out the Asians community a lot. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7244.38s)]
*  Steve Aoki told me that. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7247.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Steve Aoki said when he was a kid, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7249.38s)]
*  like, fine, he was like, finally there's an Asian hero [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7251.1s)]
*  who is like the baddest motherfucker on earth, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7253.820000000001s)]
*  who is an Asian, it was nice. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7255.9800000000005s)]
*  It's still considered one of the baddest motherfuckers. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7257.5s)]
*  Don't go to stay. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7259.38s)]
*  You see what Steve Aoki got picked for? [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7260.22s)]
*  What? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7261.820000000001s)]
*  He's going on the moon. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7262.66s)]
*  Oh, he is? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7263.62s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7265.66s)]
*  Not gonna land on it, but they're gonna orbit it. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7266.5s)]
*  Probably gonna put him in a VR chamber. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7268.9s)]
*  You're on the moon. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7271.46s)]
*  Speaking of that, they've just released [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7273.46s)]
*  all those documents, JFK documents. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7275.46s)]
*  Anything come out of that? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7277.46s)]
*  Did something come out of it? [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7278.7s)]
*  Oh, one thing that come out was they were saying [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7279.78s)]
*  that Lee Harvey Oswald was a Russian asset [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7282.66s)]
*  and that he had been honey-potted by his wife. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7286.0199999999995s)]
*  And he lived in Russia in the 1950s. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7289.58s)]
*  And they think that in this, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7291.46s)]
*  I think what Russia's trying to say in this [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7293.62s)]
*  is that they were responsible [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7295.62s)]
*  for making Lee Harvey Oswald try to kill the president. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7297.26s)]
*  There was so much shit going on with that story. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7300.3s)]
*  For anybody that thinks in 2022 [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7303.9400000000005s)]
*  that you know what happened in 1963, you're crazy. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7305.9800000000005s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7310.02s)]
*  What does Tucker Carlson say? [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7310.860000000001s)]
*  What does he say? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7312.46s)]
*  They spoke with someone who... [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7313.3s)]
*  Let's play it so we can hear his voice. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7315.22s)]
*  It's seven minutes long. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7316.62s)]
*  It's long. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7317.46s)]
*  Oh. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7318.3s)]
*  I don't think we can play it. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7319.12s)]
*  Just let me hear a little bit of it. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7319.96s)]
*  He's setting it up. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7320.780000000001s)]
*  He murders the president of the United States. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7321.62s)]
*  That's good. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7323.1s)]
*  And then, less than 48 hours later, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7323.9400000000005s)]
*  that lone gunman is himself murdered [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7325.5s)]
*  by another lone gunman. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7327.66s)]
*  What are the odds of that? [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7330.34s)]
*  It's one thing if you get struck by lightning, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7332.26s)]
*  rare but possible. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7334.02s)]
*  But if every member of your family [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7335.7s)]
*  also gets struck by lightning all on different days, [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7337.18s)]
*  you might begin to suspect [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7339.5s)]
*  these are not entirely natural events. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7340.9s)]
*  But oh, replied the US government, they are. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7344.3s)]
*  This bizarre chain of killings was all entirely natural. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7346.86s)]
*  So less than a year after the JFK assassination, [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7350.7s)]
*  the Johnson White House released something [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7353.1s)]
*  called the Warren Commission Report. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7354.94s)]
*  And the report concluded that while their motives [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7357.419999999999s)]
*  remained unclear, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7359.339999999999s)]
*  both Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby had acted alone. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7360.94s)]
*  No one helped them. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7363.82s)]
*  There was no conspiracy of any kind. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7364.82s)]
*  Case closed. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7367.139999999999s)]
*  Time to move on. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7368.0199999999995s)]
*  And many Americans did move on. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7369.419999999999s)]
*  At the time, they had no idea how shoddy and corrupt [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7371.58s)]
*  the Warren Commission was. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7374.219999999999s)]
*  It would be nearly 50 years [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7375.94s)]
*  before the CIA admitted under duress [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7377.5s)]
*  that in fact it had withheld information from investigators [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7379.62s)]
*  about its relationship with Lee Harvey Oswald. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7383.04s)]
*  But even then at the time, before that was known, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7386.44s)]
*  the government's explanation didn't seem entirely plausible [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7388.88s)]
*  and some people started asking obvious questions about it. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7392.04s)]
*  It was at that point, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7395.54s)]
*  as Americans started to doubt the official story, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7396.68s)]
*  that the term conspiracy theory entered our lexicon. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7398.82s)]
*  As Professor Lance de Haven Smith points out [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7402.64s)]
*  in his book on the subject, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7404.76s)]
*  the term conspiracy theory did not exist [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7406.28s)]
*  as a phrase in everyday American conversation before 1964. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7408.5199999999995s)]
*  In 1964, the year the Warren Commission issued its report, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7413.88s)]
*  the New York Times published five stories [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7416.68s)]
*  in which conspiracy theory appeared. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7418.96s)]
*  Now today, of course, the term conspiracy theory [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7421.92s)]
*  appears in pretty much every New York Times story [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7424.08s)]
*  about American politics. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7426.4s)]
*  It's wielded now as then as a weapon against anyone [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7428.04s)]
*  who asks questions [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7431.6s)]
*  the government doesn't feel like answering. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7432.44s)]
*  But despite 60 years of name calling, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7435.18s)]
*  those questions have not disappeared. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7437.14s)]
*  In fact, they have multiplied with time [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7438.72s)]
*  and here's one of them. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7440.4800000000005s)]
*  In April of 1964, a psychiatrist called Lewis Joylen West [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7441.84s)]
*  visited Jack Ruby in his isolation cell [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7445.84s)]
*  in his jail. This is chaos. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7448.64s)]
*  According to West's written assessment, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7450.4400000000005s)]
*  he found that Jack Ruby was quote, technically insane [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7453.16s)]
*  and in need of immediate psychiatric hospitalization. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7456.2s)]
*  Those are conclusions that puzzlingly, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7459.88s)]
*  no one who had spoken to Jack Ruby previously had reached. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7461.84s)]
*  Ruby had seemed perfectly sane to the people who knew him. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7465.0s)]
*  Lewis Joylen West pronounced him crazy. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7467.84s)]
*  But what West did not say was that he was working [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7470.92s)]
*  for the CIA at the time. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7474.2s)]
*  Lewis Joylen West was a contract psychiatrist [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7476.04s)]
*  for the spy agency. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7478.56s)]
*  He was also an expert on mind control [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7479.56s)]
*  and a prominent player in the now infamous MK Ultra program [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7481.68s)]
*  in which the CIA gave powerful psychiatric drugs [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7484.92s)]
*  to Americans without their knowledge. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7487.72s)]
*  So of all the psychiatrists in the world, [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7490.16s)]
*  what in the world was this guy doing [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7492.68s)]
*  in Jack Ruby's prison cell? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7495.3s)]
*  The media did not seem interested in finding out. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7498.24s)]
*  In fact, the New York Times in an extensive 1999 obituary [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7500.48s)]
*  of West never mentioned the fact that he had worked [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7504.719999999999s)]
*  for the CIA, much less his time in Jack Ruby's cell, [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7507.599999999999s)]
*  which seems relevant. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7511.48s)]
*  So you can see why non-crazy people would wonder [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7513.4s)]
*  about what really happened. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7516.16s)]
*  And of course, many have wondered. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7517.44s)]
*  In 1976, long forgotten, the House of Representatives [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7519.32s)]
*  impaneled a special committee to reinvestigate [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7523.4s)]
*  the JFK assassination. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7525.799999999999s)]
*  Their bipartisan conclusion? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7527.76s)]
*  Jack Kennedy was almost certainly murdered [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7530.24s)]
*  as the result of a conspiracy. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7532.0s)]
*  But the question is, a conspiracy by whom? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7534.360000000001s)]
*  Well, the obvious suspect would be the CIA. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7537.52s)]
*  Why else would the agency withhold critical evidence [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7540.12s)]
*  from investigators? [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7542.8s)]
*  Is there a benign explanation for that? [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7544.360000000001s)]
*  For maintaining this level of secrecy for this many years? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7546.8s)]
*  Not that we're aware of. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7551.04s)]
*  And it is illegal. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7552.56s)]
*  In 1992, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7554.16s)]
*  Assassination Records Collection Act. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7556.96s)]
*  That act mandated full disclosure of all documents by 2017, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7559.16s)]
*  54 years after JFK was killed. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7564.04s)]
*  The last administration promised to comply fully [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7567.96s)]
*  with that law, but under intense pressure [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7570.24s)]
*  from CIA Director Mike Pompeo, withheld in the end, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7572.64s)]
*  thousands of pages of CIA documents. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7575.92s)]
*  Today, this afternoon, the Biden administration [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7579.2s)]
*  did exactly the same thing. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7581.68s)]
*  That would be thousands of pages of documents [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7583.56s)]
*  after nearly 60 years, after the death [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7586.92s)]
*  of every single person involved. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7589.84s)]
*  But we still can't see them. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7593.56s)]
*  Clearly, it's not to protect any person. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7595.320000000001s)]
*  They're all dead. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7597.400000000001s)]
*  It's to protect an institution. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7599.200000000001s)]
*  But why? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7601.0s)]
*  Well, today we decided to find out. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7602.88s)]
*  We spoke to someone who had access [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7605.320000000001s)]
*  to these still-hidden CIA documents. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7607.080000000001s)]
*  The person was deeply familiar with what they contained. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7609.200000000001s)]
*  We asked this person directly, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7612.32s)]
*  did the CIA have a hand in the murder of John F. Kennedy, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7614.28s)]
*  an American president? [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7617.4s)]
*  And here's the reply we received verbatim. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7619.08s)]
*  Quote, the answer is yes. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7621.36s)]
*  I believe they were involved. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7624.12s)]
*  It's a whole different country from what we thought it was. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7625.96s)]
*  It's all fake. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7628.679999999999s)]
*  It's hard to imagine a more jarring response than that. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7631.36s)]
*  Again, this is not a, quote, conspiracy theorist [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7633.599999999999s)]
*  that we spoke to, not even close. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7636.44s)]
*  This is someone with direct knowledge of the information [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7638.92s)]
*  that once again is being withheld from the American public. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7641.88s)]
*  And the answer we received was unequivocal. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7645.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes, the CIA was involved [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7647.84s)]
*  in the assassination of the president. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7649.52s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7651.04s)]
*  Bruh. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7652.52s)]
*  Now some people will be so. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7653.36s)]
*  Bruh. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7654.2s)]
*  Bro. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7656.8s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7658.88s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7659.72s)]
*  97% of the documents that have now been released, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7665.72s)]
*  I think, as of this time, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7668.76s)]
*  like whatever, yesterday or something, [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7670.88s)]
*  and people are starting to look through those, [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7672.24s)]
*  they don't expect to find anything in those [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7673.96s)]
*  because there's still thousands of documents. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7675.6s)]
*  Well, I would definitely not let people read the ones [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7678.6s)]
*  that would be looking bad. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7681.68s)]
*  I mean, that's the only explanation. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7683.84s)]
*  Why can't we read them? [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7686.04s)]
*  They must be bad. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7686.72s)]
*  They can't be good. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7688.08s)]
*  Well, they say a lot of great things about the CIA, [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7689.08s)]
*  and we're pretty humble. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7690.88s)]
*  I mean, we don't want that. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7691.6s)]
*  That's going to cause chaos, that's why. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7692.64s)]
*  The whole place, the country is going to fucking riot. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7694.8s)]
*  How will they ever find out? [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7697.4800000000005s)]
*  If they're able to keep shit from us, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7698.72s)]
*  how will they ever find out? [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7701.52s)]
*  Even though there's been laws passed, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7702.360000000001s)]
*  and rulings, they're supposed to release it in 2017. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7703.6s)]
*  Like, but why not? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7708.8s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7711.8s)]
*  What's happening? [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7712.64s)]
*  And they don't have to explain. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7714.08s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7715.16s)]
*  It's like, imagine if you were being investigated [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7716.56s)]
*  by the police, and they said, hey, Brian, [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7718.240000000001s)]
*  why do you have $2 million in cash [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7721.360000000001s)]
*  and 100 pounds of cocaine? [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7723.200000000001s)]
*  And you're like, I can't let you know about that. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7724.92s)]
*  That stuff, I keep that from you. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7728.84s)]
*  So you can look into my bank account, [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7731.72s)]
*  and most of that money's from gifts. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7733.36s)]
*  People give me gifts, I'm real friendly. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7735.16s)]
*  What? [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7737.28s)]
*  Someone said you definitely sold coke. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7740.24s)]
*  No. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7742.24s)]
*  I mean, someone is saying they definitely [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7743.08s)]
*  were involved in the killing, and the CIA's like, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7747.28s)]
*  we don't have anything to say. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7749.24s)]
*  I'm surprised Trump didn't take that out, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7750.6s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7753.64s)]
*  And show everybody. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7754.46s)]
*  It seems like something he would do. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7755.3s)]
*  You ever heard Putin talk about American presidents? [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7756.28s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7759.2s)]
*  He does this, he has this conversation [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7760.36s)]
*  when they're talking about Trump. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7763.48s)]
*  I believe it was while Trump was running for office. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7764.36s)]
*  And he was essentially saying, Trump is a smart guy, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7766.92s)]
*  but all these ideas that he has, they'll never work. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7771.04s)]
*  He said, I've sat through two different presidents. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7774.04s)]
*  He's like, this is what happens. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7776.599999999999s)]
*  They, I think he said three presidents. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7778.24s)]
*  He goes, this is what happens. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7780.24s)]
*  You have all these ideas, and then these men [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7781.28s)]
*  with the dark suits show up, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7783.28s)]
*  and they tell you how the country's run. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7786.84s)]
*  Like, see if you can find that video, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7788.56s)]
*  because it's very interesting. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7790.12s)]
*  Because it's Putin explaining why no one [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7791.96s)]
*  ever falls through on their promises. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7795.68s)]
*  No one does. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7797.58s)]
*  Everyone runs for office, they have all these grand ideas. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7798.42s)]
*  I'm gonna let all the potheads out of jail, [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7800.76s)]
*  and I'm gonna make this legal and that legal. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7802.68s)]
*  Well, there was no one in jail for possession. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7805.8s)]
*  That idea that people were in jail, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7808.48s)]
*  federal prison rather, excuse me, [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7810.04s)]
*  there's no one in prison for possession. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7811.5199999999995s)]
*  The idea that people were gonna be released [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7813.56s)]
*  from federal position, jeez. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7815.36s)]
*  The idea that people were gonna be released [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7817.92s)]
*  from federal prison with marijuana possession charges. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7819.44s)]
*  There's no one in federal prison [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7821.96s)]
*  with marijuana possession charges. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7823.44s)]

*  and get them. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7910.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7911.78s)]
*  What does this say? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7912.6s)]

*  You have to read it, though. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7915.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7915.9400000000005s)]

*  No. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7917.6s)]
*  It says, you know I've communicated [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7918.42s)]
*  with one US president, with the second and the third. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7923.46s)]
*  Presidents come and go, but the politics remain the same. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7925.62s)]
*  Do you know why that is? [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7928.42s)]
*  Because the bureaucracy has a lot of power. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7929.74s)]
*  So a person is elected. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7935.58s)]
*  He comes with his ideas. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7937.219999999999s)]
*  Then the people with the briefcases [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7938.66s)]
*  come to visit him, well dressed in dark suits, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7940.12s)]
*  kind of like mine, except instead of a red tie, [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7942.179999999999s)]
*  it's a black or a navy. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7945.66s)]
*  And then they explain what to do. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7947.26s)]
*  And the whole rhetoric changes, you see. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7948.62s)]
*  This happens from one administration to the next. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7950.42s)]
*  And he's right. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7954.5s)]
*  And that's probably what it is. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7955.94s)]
*  And that's why there's thousands of documents [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7958.62s)]
*  that can't be released, because we've got to pretend. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7960.34s)]
*  That's why they're going to run Biden again in 2024. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7963.46s)]
*  Fucking wheel him out there. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7965.42s)]
*  We're going to make him win. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7966.66s)]
*  We're going to make Trump look like such a piece of shit. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7968.62s)]
*  Maybe someone from the CIA convinced [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7970.86s)]
*  Trump to sell those NFTs. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7972.62s)]
*  Mr. Trump, what I think you should do [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7974.1s)]
*  is say you're the greatest president ever. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7975.26s)]
*  Lincoln, better than Washington. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7976.9s)]
*  You think? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7978.38s)]
*  Should I say that? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7979.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, go say it. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7979.94s)]
*  Go say it. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7980.9s)]
*  If there was somebody on his team that was like a CIA mole, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7982.18s)]

*  sneaks in with the cartel or something like that, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7994.38s)]
*  they could do that. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7996.82s)]
*  If you just stroked his ego the right way, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=7999.54s)]
*  maybe that's what they did. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8002.26s)]
*  They get him to sell these NFTs. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8003.38s)]
*  He also made a shitload of money. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8005.54s)]

*  the Dr. Manhattan was a regular guy. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8276.26s)]
*  Dr. Manhattan was supposed to dematerialize [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8278.82s)]
*  and disappear from Earth, and then he would run [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8282.42s)]
*  through the hallways as a ghost in the movie. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8284.82s)]
*  And then he came back and reformulated as Dr. Manhattan, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8287.38s)]
*  who's basically a god. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8291.98s)]
*  And he would have sex with his girlfriend, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8294.5s)]
*  but he would make multiple copies of him [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8297.58s)]
*  that would be constantly doing work [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8299.34s)]
*  while the one copy of him is having sex with her [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8300.78s)]
*  and she got all bummed out. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8302.94s)]
*  It was a great movie, man. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8305.34s)]
*  I don't think I ever saw it. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8306.86s)]

*  Right there, yeah. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8313.38s)]
*  I mean, he's just not built right. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8314.22s)]
*  Like, Dr. Manhattan is supposed to be like [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8317.7s)]
*  the perfect Greek god sculpted out of granite [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8320.14s)]

*  He's not a human with a t-shirt on. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8328.06s)]

*  You can't make him a regular guy. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8337.18s)]
*  You can't make him just a regular human. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8338.78s)]
*  I mean, he has to be glowing and he can't wear t-shirts. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8340.300000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8664.84s)]
*  That's a lot of people are on it, including the Musk Man. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8665.679999999998s)]

*  Yeah, he posted about it. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8670.58s)]
*  Yeah, he posted. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8672.359999999999s)]
*  He's getting ripped. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8673.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it makes you have less of an appetite, apparently. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8674.4s)]
*  And it might also help you burn fat better. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8678.080000000002s)]
*  I think it's, but a big part of it is [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8682.2s)]
*  it affects your appetite. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8684.44s)]
*  You get full quicker. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8686.080000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I guess they're trying to throw it through the FDA [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8687.560000000001s)]
*  as fast as possible, right? [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8689.76s)]
*  Because it works so well or something like that. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8691.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8692.560000000001s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8694.720000000001s)]
*  I think it's great. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8696.28s)]
*  Magic, finally a magic diet pill. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8697.92s)]
*  You gonna get on it? [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8700.68s)]
*  Hell yeah, I'll get on it. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8701.6s)]
*  You all in? [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8702.44s)]
*  It's injections. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8703.26s)]
*  Huh, is it? [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8704.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8704.94s)]
*  How many? [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8705.76s)]
*  Like once a day? [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8706.6s)]
*  Not that bad. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8707.84s)]
*  This one was like once a week, maybe. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8708.68s)]
*  There's another one that works just as well, I suppose, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8710.68s)]
*  but that's a lot more fluid [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8712.76s)]
*  and it's like three, four times a week. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8714.720000000001s)]
*  How about you do it every day? [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8716.2s)]
*  Fuck it, let's go. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8717.28s)]
*  Jack by summer, the Brian Red Band story. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8719.560000000001s)]
*  Now we talked before about you and David Lucas [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8721.960000000001s)]
*  doing like a weight loss challenge. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8724.800000000001s)]
*  The problem is, especially you just telling me [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8726.560000000001s)]
*  that you don't work out. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8728.960000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if David works out. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8730.84s)]
*  I think David does work out, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8732.24s)]
*  but probably not too rigorously. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8733.32s)]
*  I don't want anybody dying. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8736.04s)]
*  I'm like, you can't have a contest [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8738.880000000001s)]
*  where guys try to get healthy the quickest [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8740.320000000002s)]
*  because that's not healthy. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8742.36s)]
*  It's actually not healthy to starve yourself [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8743.84s)]
*  and work out like a demon to try to win some money. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8745.6s)]
*  Right, and I would definitely, [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8747.68s)]
*  I would definitely try to, I would want to beat Dave [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8754.400000000001s)]
*  so I would go crazy. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8757.78s)]
*  I would be eating celery. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8759.2s)]
*  And we were gonna put a lot of money on the line, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8760.04s)]
*  but I started thinking about it one day when I was high [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8761.960000000001s)]
*  and I was like, ooh, what if someone dies? [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8764.4s)]
*  Or what if, and also it would just be like, [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8766.119999999999s)]
*  David just, you know, he will lose like 100 pounds a week. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8768.52s)]
*  You know? [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8771.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, he's bigger than you too. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8772.6s)]
*  So we couldn't make it like who weighs the less. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8778.0s)]
*  Right, it would have to be percentage of the stuff. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8779.76s)]
*  Because when Bert and Bill, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8782.52s)]
*  Bert and Tom rather did that weight loss challenge, [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8784.6s)]
*  they dehydrated the shit out of them. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8788.64s)]
*  Look at David Lucas, core strength is very important. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8790.0s)]
*  He's got core strength, ladies and gentlemen. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8792.68s)]
*  He's pushing that thing towards his dick. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8795.08s)]
*  And he's looking at you. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8797.0s)]
*  And he's looking at you. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8797.84s)]
*  It's a great stare. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8798.68s)]
*  He's a funny motherfucker. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8799.96s)]
*  Him and, when him and Tony go back and forth [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8801.48s)]
*  with each other, that's all he's eating. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8803.439999999999s)]
*  Do you remember him and- [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8804.8s)]
*  That's a piece of brownie. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8805.8s)]
*  Him and Tony wrestling. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8806.64s)]
*  Yeah, Tony fucked him up. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8808.48s)]
*  You can't just eat a brownie and say, I'm eating light. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8810.359999999999s)]
*  I don't think he did, I was kidding. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8812.96s)]
*  I was kidding about that. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8814.279999999999s)]
*  That wasn't his food? [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8815.119999999999s)]
*  No, it was, he said that's what got brought off for dessert. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8816.019999999999s)]
*  Oh, he was upset. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8818.359999999999s)]
*  Give me 30 of those. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8819.56s)]
*  I worked out hard today. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8821.08s)]
*  It's hard, man. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8823.32s)]
*  It's hard, once you're big, it's hard. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8826.199999999999s)]
*  And I've never gotten big, but I've gotten bigger. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8828.32s)]
*  I get like a little fat when I drink too much [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8830.08s)]
*  and then I eat too much pasta. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8832.8s)]
*  I'll go like a few weeks when I do this, I'll be like, ew. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8834.46s)]
*  Or I catch myself in the mirror, [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8838.68s)]
*  my fucking stomach is hanging out. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8840.039999999999s)]
*  But I bounce back quick. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8842.72s)]
*  If you, as long as I just train smart [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8844.119999999999s)]
*  or where I'm working out and really like getting after it [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8848.359999999999s)]
*  every day and making sure I don't eat stupid shit, [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8851.06s)]
*  my body bounces back quick. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8853.3s)]
*  The problem is when you let that happen, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8855.18s)]
*  like if I got fat for like a month [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8856.779999999999s)]
*  and then it was the second month, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8859.019999999999s)]
*  the next thing you know I'm 30 pounds overweight, [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8860.42s)]
*  not eight pounds overweight, but 30 pounds overweight, [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8862.06s)]
*  you're like, yo, that's when it gets rough. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8864.34s)]
*  And then you get into this habit. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8868.22s)]
*  I like getting up in the morning and eating pastries. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8869.779999999999s)]
*  Do you? [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8872.1s)]
*  No, I do though. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8874.82s)]
*  I do while I'm eating them, fuck yeah. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8876.3s)]
*  Everybody does, that's why they're so hard to not eat. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8878.019999999999s)]
*  If you could have like chocolate croissants every day, [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8881.26s)]
*  the best ones with like the gooey chocolate [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8883.9s)]
*  inside of them, nothing? [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8886.1s)]

*  one of the first things we did when we rented a car, [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8981.34s)]
*  there's a Krispy Kreme on the way to the beach [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8983.58s)]
*  from the airport, like right out of the airport, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8986.5s)]
*  oh, so it was like a thing we did. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8988.58s)]
*  And every year we did it, we're like, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8990.9s)]
*  we're not doing this again. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8991.9s)]
*  Because we're all like, oh, [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8992.980000000001s)]
*  you eat three or four of those fucking things. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8994.78s)]
*  And then you feel like shit when you're at the beach, [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8996.380000000001s)]
*  like, oh my God, I feel terrible. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=8997.98s)]

*  My body doesn't know what the fuck to do. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9003.14s)]
*  I'm crashing hard. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9004.42s)]
*  I was on a plane when someone brought [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9005.7s)]
*  the suitcase of White Castle burgers with them. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9007.14s)]
*  Like carry on. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9009.3s)]
*  All right, that's a little bit. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9010.78s)]
*  I had White Castle a couple, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9012.06s)]
*  or like a month ago in Vegas, man, that shit's so good. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9014.02s)]
*  What percentage of that is actually meat? [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9016.42s)]
*  Well, it's very thin meat. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9018.380000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9019.82s)]
*  So it's not much meat, but it's meat. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9020.66s)]
*  Are they doing it like McDonald's does though? [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9023.06s)]
*  Doesn't McDonald's have some like shenanigans going on? [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9024.9s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9027.74s)]
*  Wasn't there like some goo? [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9028.58s)]
*  Remember? [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9030.619999999999s)]

*  Well, let's find out. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9037.46s)]
*  There was something about the beef [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9038.98s)]
*  in McDonald's hamburgers. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9040.3s)]
*  I forget, because like there was one company [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9042.1s)]
*  that like trademarked the 100% beef thing. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9045.699999999999s)]
*  Did TikTokers expose how McDonald's McRib is cooked? [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9050.46s)]
*  This is true. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9052.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's true. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9055.54s)]
*  I love how they're storing and cooking it though. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9056.380000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's talking about what's in it. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9057.86s)]
*  Yeah, but try burger. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9059.140000000001s)]
*  Just Google, this is what I want you to Google. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9061.460000000001s)]
*  I want you to Google McDonald's beef additives. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9064.380000000001s)]
*  By whole. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9070.5s)]
*  By whole. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9071.42s)]
*  All together in that order. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9074.7s)]
*  Don't just start with by whole. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9076.740000000002s)]
*  You fuck up the search. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9078.5s)]
*  Every one of our McDonald's burgers [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9080.380000000001s)]
*  is made with 100% pure beef. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9081.94s)]
*  Right, but here's what I want you to Google. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9085.58s)]
*  Google the term. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9087.859999999999s)]
*  No fillers, no additives. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9088.699999999999s)]
*  Right, okay, so it's all beef. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9089.539999999999s)]
*  Google the term, because this was the rumor, [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9091.699999999999s)]
*  was that the term 100% pure beef was copyrighted [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9094.38s)]
*  by McDonald's. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9099.22s)]
*  So they could say 100% pure beef, but. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9100.859999999999s)]
*  Are you talking about Taco Bell? [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9104.859999999999s)]
*  No, Taco Bell definitely has some stuff in there. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9106.38s)]
*  They put frisbees. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9108.9s)]
*  So this seems like one of those rumors. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9111.18s)]
*  It was bullshit? [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9113.26s)]
*  Yeah, it was a rumor, it was 100% pure beef. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9114.1s)]
*  And it was like, this is false. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9116.98s)]
*  Oh, it is false. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9118.18s)]
*  So was there any, at any time, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9119.1s)]
*  did McDonald's have stuff in their beef other than beef? [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9121.9s)]
*  Is that a more recent thing? [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9124.7s)]
*  It's amazing how they sell cheeseburgers [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9128.62s)]
*  and In-N-Out sells cheeseburgers. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9131.380000000001s)]

*  But you're gonna go in that line. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9135.86s)]
*  What line, Joe? [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9137.7s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9138.54s)]
*  In-N-Out by me never has a line. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9139.36s)]

*  I know. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9144.6s)]
*  Why, how come they don't have a line on here? [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9145.44s)]
*  You know, well, where I live, [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9146.68s)]

*  into these Indian curries, [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9346.56s)]
*  three different Indian curries. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9348.88s)]
*  It was sensational. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9350.16s)]
*  It was so good. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9351.96s)]
*  I made videos. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9352.96s)]

*  Tim Dillon, out where he's at, those kind of places, [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9376.04s)]
*  those are nice, man. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9379.4s)]
*  It's just so peaceful at night [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9381.08s)]
*  and you see the stars. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9383.2s)]
*  Those bedroom communities, those sort of sleepy communities, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9385.56s)]
*  until you get a murder-suicide down the block, [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9388.800000000001s)]
*  they're nice. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9390.720000000001s)]

*  You're more in the country. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9401.48s)]
*  You must have deer in your yard every day. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9403.359999999999s)]
*  Not as much deer, mostly the bobcats [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9405.92s)]
*  and weird animals like that. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9409.72s)]
*  We also have a lot of armadillos. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9411.24s)]
*  I see dead armadillos everywhere. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9415.279999999999s)]
*  That's such a Texas animal. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9417.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I've never seen them alive. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9418.52s)]
*  They've always just been on this side of the road. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9420.72s)]
*  Coyotes, too, a lot of coyotes. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9424.0s)]
*  Yeah, I heard a lot of them in South Texas. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9425.439999999999s)]
*  They were howling at night. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9428.64s)]
*  It's something, I don't want them near me, [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9431.12s)]
*  but it's something cool about the fact that they're out there. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9433.16s)]
*  That's with all, even wolves, man. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9435.960000000001s)]
*  Imagine living in Montana and hearing wolves at night. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9437.84s)]
*  Woo-woo-woo. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9440.24s)]
*  You hear about that chick that shot a husky [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9444.04s)]
*  because she said it was a wolf or something? [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9447.44s)]
*  Oh, that's awful. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9448.92s)]
*  That's awful. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9450.6s)]
*  Well, the thing about shooting something with a gun [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9451.52s)]
*  is you're looking at it through a rifle scope [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9453.720000000001s)]
*  from hundreds of yards away. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9455.76s)]
*  You could think a husky was a wolf. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9457.92s)]
*  And if it's in wolf country, you would assume it's a wolf. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9460.72s)]
*  That sucks. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9463.2s)]
*  Isn't it funny that they look so similar, [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9464.84s)]
*  but one of them really bums you out? [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9468.24s)]
*  A wolf bums me out if someone shoots it, [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9470.28s)]
*  but they have to keep their populations in check. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9471.92s)]
*  Wolves, there's a reason why they eradicated wolves [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9476.28s)]
*  from the West back in the day, [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9478.44s)]
*  and it's not because they're awesome. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9479.96s)]
*  It's the same reason why they stopped World War I [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9481.56s)]
*  so that the Russians and the Germans made a ceasefire [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9483.56s)]
*  because so many of them were getting killed by wolves. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9486.08s)]
*  Wolves are rough. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9488.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're fucking amazing. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9490.48s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that wolves are real, [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9492.24s)]
*  but you don't want a lot of them around. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9496.04s)]
*  You don't want a lot of them around [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9499.44s)]
*  where there's not a lot of food. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9500.44s)]
*  Especially not if you like your kids and you like your dog. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9501.36s)]
*  That's where all that Little Red Riding Hood shit, [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9504.68s)]
*  the big bad wolf, that was real. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9506.960000000001s)]
*  Back when guns weren't so good, [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9509.64s)]
*  when they wrote those stories, [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9511.52s)]
*  you couldn't really shoot that many wolves. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9512.88s)]
*  You really couldn't eradicate them. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9515.16s)]
*  It wasn't easy to do. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9516.76s)]
*  It's still not easy to do with guns. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9518.04s)]
*  The way they do it is with poison. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9520.12s)]
*  The way they killed the wolves in the West [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9522.52s)]
*  was they would shoot a horse, [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9524.560000000001s)]
*  and they would inject the horse with poison, like cyanide. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9526.240000000002s)]
*  They would put it in its veins [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9530.36s)]
*  and pump cyanide through the horse's body, [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9531.800000000001s)]
*  and then the wolves would eat the carcass [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9534.080000000002s)]
*  and they would all die. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9536.640000000001s)]
*  But it didn't work with the coyotes. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9538.44s)]
*  Coyotes are too slick. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9540.480000000001s)]
*  They couldn't poison them. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9542.2s)]
*  They could poison a few here and there, [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9543.52s)]
*  but then they would figure it out [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9545.36s)]
*  because they'd do the roll call, [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9547.560000000001s)]
*  and then the females would have more pups, [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9548.68s)]
*  and then they would spread their branches out. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9550.640000000001s)]
*  They would move to different parts of the state, [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9552.960000000001s)]
*  and they just kept expanding. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9555.04s)]
*  So the more they tried to kill wolves off, [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9556.24s)]
*  the more they made more coyotes. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9557.92s)]
*  Wow. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9559.6s)]
*  Yeah, and also the wolves would chase the coyotes [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9560.44s)]
*  away from the dead horses. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9563.04s)]
*  They wouldn't let them eat it. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9564.0s)]
*  So the wolves would just gorge on it, [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9565.24s)]
*  fucking tear it apart, and then they would all croak. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9567.32s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9572.2s)]
*  And then in the 1990s, they're like, [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9573.2s)]
*  oh, we made a mistake. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9574.68s)]
*  We're gonna bring wolves back. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9575.640000000001s)]
*  They dropped them off in Yellowstone, [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9578.0s)]
*  and they just fucking decimated all those poor animals, [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9579.56s)]
*  didn't know what a wolf was. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9581.88s)]
*  Imagine there's no wolves. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9583.48s)]
*  You're an elk having a great time. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9584.68s)]
*  People like take selfies with you, that's fine. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9586.6s)]
*  There was no selfies back then, but photos, whatever. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9588.68s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, there's wolves. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9592.0s)]
*  The cleanup crew. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9595.68s)]
*  Ever seen this picture? [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9596.52s)]
*  This guy riding an elk. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9598.08s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9599.44s)]
*  Missoula, Montana, 1910. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9600.28s)]
*  Wow, he put a fucking saddle on an elk. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9603.16s)]
*  Santa Claus. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9605.36s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9606.199999999999s)]
*  Imagine if that thing just decides to fucking swing [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9607.880000000001s)]
*  its head and stab him in the neck. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9609.240000000002s)]
*  Look at the antlers on that fucker. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9611.84s)]
*  This guy's riding a moose. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9614.6s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9615.880000000001s)]
*  Is that a painting? [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9617.560000000001s)]
*  No, it's just an old picture. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9618.720000000001s)]
*  Shitty old painting, or shitty old photograph, rather. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9619.92s)]

*  That's not, that's a... [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9627.44s)]
*  That's a moose. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9628.76s)]

*  No, no, no, I know, but this... [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9632.240000000002s)]
*  Doesn't look real? [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9633.28s)]
*  Doesn't look like a real photo. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9634.12s)]
*  It looks real to me, but I'm gullible. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9635.44s)]
*  The lighting seems real. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9637.56s)]
*  They already got me with that father-son thing. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9638.4s)]
*  The lighting just seems off on this. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9640.64s)]
*  Does it? [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9642.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9643.4s)]
*  It does seem weird. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9644.24s)]
*  It seems it could be real. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9645.08s)]
*  I'm not going full fake, [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9646.08s)]
*  but just that something seems off about it. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9647.24s)]
*  I think you're right about the face of the, [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9648.44s)]
*  the face of the moose looks a little sketch. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9650.76s)]
*  He doesn't seem to fit in that. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9652.52s)]
*  The lighting on the trees isn't matching [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9654.08s)]
*  what's on him and the moose and stuff. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9655.72s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it got cut and paced [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9657.199999999999s)]
*  onto a different background. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9658.92s)]

*  That's what makes a good Photoshop. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9663.84s)]
*  The most is that blending is like, [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9665.960000000001s)]

*  and see what we find? [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9670.160000000002s)]
*  Do it like they did with Obama's birth certificate. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9671.0s)]
*  Look at that one. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9673.36s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9675.320000000002s)]

*  That looks fake. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9681.36s)]
*  The difference between her blanket and the elk's body. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9682.2s)]

*  That looks fake. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9685.52s)]
*  That looks really fake. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9686.36s)]
*  Yeah, it looks really fake. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9687.2s)]
*  Like all the, the difference between her blanket [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9688.04s)]
*  and that elk's body looks fake to me. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9690.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there's no shadow. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9692.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9693.560000000001s)]

*  Go back to that one again. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9696.64s)]
*  That one looks real. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9697.56s)]
*  Stuck. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9698.52s)]
*  Oh. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9699.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9701.92s)]
*  It's so annoying. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9702.76s)]
*  They can't control it the same way they used to. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9703.6s)]
*  Scroll down, see if you can find it. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9705.08s)]
*  So here's the other problem with this. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9706.52s)]
*  She's not in any control of that elk. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9708.279999999999s)]
*  Right, she's just holding onto the saddle. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9710.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9712.039999999999s)]
*  Okay, that's fake for sure. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9712.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's no shadow. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9713.72s)]
*  How'd she even? [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9715.279999999999s)]
*  It's just blending in there. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9716.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a fake green screen. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9716.96s)]
*  Yeah, it looks fake. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9717.84s)]
*  But I guarantee you someone's ridden a fucking elk. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9720.6s)]
*  I guarantee you there's been a dude [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9722.88s)]
*  who put a fucking saddle on everything. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9724.8s)]

*  People are assholes. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9730.16s)]

*  I mean, look, Santa's reindeer. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9734.24s)]
*  I mean, they had reindeers pulling sleds. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9735.72s)]
*  Did you see the video of the guy smoking [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9737.56s)]
*  a cigarette riding the bull? [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9738.8s)]
*  No. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9740.64s)]
*  Oh shit, all right. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9741.48s)]

*  They're like, this is the greatest sporting achievement [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9743.599999999999s)]
*  of all time. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9745.519999999999s)]
*  He's smoking while he's riding a bull? [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9747.24s)]
*  He's got like a cast on one arm too. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9749.0s)]
*  And he's just squeezing it with his legs. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9750.4s)]
*  It looks so real, it could be fake too. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9753.52s)]
*  It's like it's so crazy of a thing. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9755.64s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9757.32s)]
*  Thank God for stupidity. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9760.92s)]
*  Is the bull the same as a like a log horn? [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9762.92s)]
*  Or is that something different? [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9765.720000000001s)]
*  It's a different kind of, [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9766.56s)]
*  oh wow, that looks real as fuck, dude. [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9767.6s)]
*  The guy's got a cast on his arm. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9769.800000000001s)]
*  It's the part of the bull part. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9771.52s)]
*  He doesn't go off. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9773.32s)]
*  He's on it for a whole time. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9774.48s)]
*  He rides it till it's tired. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9775.800000000001s)]
*  No, he's not even holding on. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9777.880000000001s)]
*  He's just going with it while he's smoking a cigarette. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9779.6s)]
*  That looks real as fuck, dude. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9781.68s)]
*  He's just a bad man. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9784.36s)]
*  And that's not like the best bull at kicking people off. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9786.92s)]
*  The bull seems like he's been tranquilized. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9789.84s)]
*  Oh, he almost got knocked off. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9792.64s)]
*  He gets back on. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9793.720000000001s)]
*  Well, he's got, his stirrups are tied in real tight. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9794.68s)]
*  Obviously. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9797.76s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9798.6s)]
*  His feet are being held in? [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9799.44s)]
*  His feet are held in real tight. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9800.26s)]
*  And the bull just gave up. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9801.24s)]
*  He's like, fuck it. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9802.08s)]
*  Nope, one more time. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9802.9s)]
*  I'm gonna shake this dude off me. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9804.08s)]
*  He doesn't like it. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9805.52s)]
*  How, wait, hold on. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9807.84s)]
*  How are his feet? [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9809.24s)]
*  No, see his feet aren't tied in. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9810.08s)]
*  They probably undid it there. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9811.44s)]
*  He would die if that happened though. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9813.96s)]
*  Let's see. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9815.36s)]
*  You're right. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9816.2s)]
*  You're right. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9817.039999999999s)]
*  It looks like he's just pinching with his legs. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9817.86s)]
*  You just gotta squeeze. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9818.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9819.76s)]
*  Imagine that guy's guard. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9820.6s)]
*  Probably the best Jiu-Jitsu guard of all time. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9822.76s)]
*  He'd probably capture you. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9825.16s)]
*  You're fucked. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9826.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9826.92s)]
*  That guy would have the best triangle ever in history. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9827.76s)]
*  But if you think like, you just squeeze with your legs, [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9830.6s)]
*  your legs are so much bigger than your arms. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9832.8s)]
*  You ever seen that video of a guy, [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9835.0s)]
*  the bull comes at him and he grabs the bull in a headlock [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9836.88s)]
*  and throws the bull over the top of him? [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9839.92s)]
*  The bull comes down, he clamps a hole in the bull's head [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9842.56s)]
*  and rolls with it and gets on top of the bull. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9846.22s)]
*  Wow. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9849.199999999999s)]
*  And guys are sending it to me like, [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9850.039999999999s)]
*  imagine this guy's head and arm choke. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9850.859999999999s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9852.199999999999s)]
*  BJ Penn actually sent it to me. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9853.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, hilarious. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9854.679999999998s)]
*  And he's like, dude, guillotines for days. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9855.519999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, look at this guy's choke. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9857.039999999999s)]
*  This guy's got an insane choke. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9859.32s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9860.279999999999s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9861.56s)]
*  That's one, that's a different one. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9862.4s)]
*  That's not the same one. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9863.64s)]
*  This guy headlocked it and he rolled it over the top. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9865.48s)]
*  Like the bull came towards him [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9868.88s)]
*  and he grabbed a hold of the neck, got to the side. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9871.58s)]
*  And this is a different one too. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9874.759999999998s)]
*  But I think people probably got good at that. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9876.359999999999s)]
*  So he's hanging onto it while they let it go. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9879.439999999999s)]
*  The guy's holding his tail. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9881.72s)]
*  It says he slams it. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9884.0s)]
*  So let's see. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9885.359999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9886.38s)]
*  So the guy's holding his tail. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9887.359999999999s)]
*  That's kind of cheating. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9888.439999999999s)]
*  The other guy wasn't holding the head [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9889.279999999999s)]
*  or there wasn't a guy holding the tail with the other guy. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9890.64s)]
*  This guy's just hanging onto the neck. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9894.08s)]
*  But again, oh, he's tripping it. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9896.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's a wrestler. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9897.84s)]
*  That guy's got to be a wrestler. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9899.36s)]
*  And he took it down. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9901.92s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9902.76s)]
*  That's a very young bull. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9904.04s)]
*  The other one, the bull had horns. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9906.2s)]
*  And the bull was coming at him and he [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9907.960000000001s)]
*  clamped a hole in the bull's neck and flipped it [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9909.44s)]
*  to the ground. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9911.6s)]
*  This is it. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9912.04s)]
*  Oh. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9912.68s)]

*  Watch how this guy does this. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9922.12s)]
*  He comes at the guy. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9924.08s)]
*  The guy grabs a hold of it. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9925.04s)]
*  Boom, over the top. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9926.64s)]
*  And hangs on. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9929.0s)]
*  This dude is a hell of a grappler. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9930.199999999999s)]
*  That squeeze is fucking amazing. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9933.0s)]

*  We probably didn't see the end. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9939.92s)]
*  Ray Malzum. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9942.08s)]
*  Yeah, eventually let's go. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9942.84s)]
*  And that bull sticks a horn right up his asshole. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=9943.92s)]

*  It's brilliant the way they thought of it. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10026.36s)]
*  Let's do a show where we see stuff that we would watch, [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10028.4s)]
*  like if we were friends, we're just all hanging out, [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10031.72s)]
*  and we couldn't broadcast it anywhere [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10033.88s)]
*  because it would get removed. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10035.44s)]
*  It's illegal. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10036.96s)]
*  But if we make people pay to see it, it's totally legal. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10038.08s)]
*  And we could just have this thing. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10041.08s)]
*  We sign up. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10042.4s)]
*  And we'll map out. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10043.2s)]
*  And they hired producers from Saturday Night Live. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10045.240000000002s)]
*  Real people. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10048.320000000002s)]

*  They do them once every couple months or something like that. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10058.880000000001s)]
*  And when they do them, they're fucking nuts. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10061.44s)]
*  They wait until they have enough sketches [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10063.720000000001s)]
*  and enough fucked up videos. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10066.0s)]
*  And then they bring in a guest and freak them the fuck out. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10067.68s)]
*  That's great. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10071.400000000001s)]

*  What's his style of comedy like? [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10203.32s)]
*  A lot of crazy stories and talking shit. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10205.36s)]

*  Halkios. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10235.44s)]
*  Halkios. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10236.28s)]
*  Halkios. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10237.12s)]
*  That's a fucking Greek name. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10238.52s)]
*  That's a name. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10239.36s)]
*  Stavos Halkios. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10240.2s)]
*  He didn't do it here, but he'll lean into this [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10241.04s)]
*  Baltimore accent real heavy. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10242.24s)]
*  Because I asked my chiropractor for a happy ending. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10243.880000000001s)]
*  Now that we got that out of the way. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10247.36s)]
*  Fuck the Steelers, yo. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10249.36s)]
*  Let's fucking go Ravens, baby. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10250.68s)]

*  Fucking Kenny only throws pickets. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10256.08s)]
*  You see his ass faking an injury [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10258.04s)]
*  because he was too scared to face the Ravens defense, yo. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10259.800000000001s)]
*  That hit wasn't nothing, yo. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10262.4s)]
*  If that was me, I would've eaten that shit up. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10263.720000000001s)]
*  Fucking touchdown pass, the next play, yo. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10266.24s)]
*  But not everybody's built like a fucking champion like me. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10268.84s)]
*  Or Joe Flacco. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10271.36s)]
*  Who in New York should have kept in the game [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10272.640000000001s)]
*  so that they could defeat the Bills by the way. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10274.28s)]
*  Anyway, Kenny's fucking too scared to face the Ravens. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10277.0s)]
*  That's a character. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10279.84s)]
*  He does, obviously. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10281.08s)]
*  That's a character he's doing. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10281.92s)]
*  A Baltimore goof. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10283.04s)]
*  That reminded me, that guy, Pat from Minaki died. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10285.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10289.04s)]
*  Baby Bird, I was there with you. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10290.44s)]
*  That was crazy. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10292.400000000001s)]
*  That to this day is the craziest experience [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10293.960000000001s)]
*  I've ever had broadcasting anything. [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10296.76s)]
*  That was nuts. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10299.0s)]
*  When I proposed that idea, I was joking around. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10300.6s)]
*  I didn't think that guy would really lean his head [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10303.6s)]
*  off the edge of a garbage can [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10305.84s)]
*  and let that guy throw up in his mouth. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10307.84s)]
*  There was so much puke. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10310.119999999999s)]
*  It was so crazy. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10311.439999999999s)]
*  If you haven't seen it, folks, Google Baby Bird ONA. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10313.24s)]
*  The ONA days, man. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10316.92s)]

*  That was real. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10320.119999999999s)]
*  Still around, so I'll watch later. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10320.96s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't seem like it. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10322.16s)]
*  We watched it recently. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10323.32s)]
*  Didn't we on Protect Our Parks? [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10324.88s)]
*  Yeah, just in case someone didn't watch that. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10326.08s)]
*  Paltalk. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10327.4s)]
*  It's still around. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10328.24s)]
*  I forgot about Paltalk. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10329.08s)]
*  It's Paltalk. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10329.92s)]
*  They were the first guys to do that. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10330.96s)]
*  They were broadcasting live on Paltalk [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10332.68s)]
*  while they were on the radio. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10334.92s)]
*  Who owned, what is Paltalk now? [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10336.36s)]
*  Did they get bought out in their? [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10339.28s)]
*  Elon bought it and shut it down. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10340.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10341.52s)]
*  He needs to bring back Vine. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10342.880000000001s)]
*  He was going to, wasn't he? [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10344.68s)]
*  He mentioned it, yeah. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10345.52s)]
*  It's still open, Paltalk. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10346.36s)]
*  Paltalk is? [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10348.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10348.92s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10349.76s)]
*  That was Strangers. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10350.6s)]
*  Might have rebranded a little bit. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10351.44s)]
*  Yeah, this is probably a different company. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10352.28s)]
*  I remember when you had it back then, [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10354.08s)]
*  you had, no, I think that's it. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10356.28s)]
*  When you had it back then, it had to be PC. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10358.12s)]
*  That's why I never had it. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10360.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10361.08s)]
*  You couldn't use it on a Mac. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10361.92s)]
*  And that was back when I was trying to not play video games. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10363.12s)]
*  Livestream is only on Paltalk. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10365.2s)]
*  Oh, there it goes. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10366.68s)]
*  So there's shows that livestream only. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10367.72s)]
*  But that was the first sort of internet version [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10369.48s)]
*  of the radio show where they would stream [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10374.24s)]
*  both on the internet and on the radio at the same time. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10376.6s)]
*  The ONA days, man, for people, [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10380.44s)]
*  it's hard now to believe that there was no podcasts [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10383.960000000001s)]
*  at one point in time. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10387.68s)]
*  But there was a show where all the comics would go [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10388.68s)]
*  and just fuck around, and it was great. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10392.199999999999s)]
*  And Bill Burr was like a regular on it almost every day. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10393.84s)]
*  DiPaolo, Burr. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10396.64s)]
*  Patrice. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10398.439999999999s)]
*  Patrice was the man. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10399.279999999999s)]
*  If it was a Patrice episode of ONA, [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10401.519999999999s)]
*  you knew it was gonna be great. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10403.32s)]
*  Rich Voss, Jim Norton, I mean, [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10404.88s)]
*  those guys were fucking great. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10407.6s)]
*  It was a great show. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10408.88s)]
*  Monster Rain. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10409.72s)]
*  It was a, it was Monster Rain. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10411.279999999999s)]
*  It was a great show, man. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10414.119999999999s)]
*  It was a fucking great show. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10415.72s)]
*  So much fun. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10416.76s)]
*  And for young, stupid guys like me, [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10417.6s)]
*  it was like, oh my God, there's a thing like this? [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10420.52s)]
*  You know? [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10423.16s)]
*  And people say that they ripped off Howard. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10424.0s)]
*  It was certainly influenced by Howard. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10427.24s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10428.720000000001s)]
*  Everybody was influenced by Howard, including me. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10429.560000000001s)]
*  But what they did was different because they had a hang. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10431.48s)]
*  And that's what we did. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10434.32s)]
*  When we did Ice House Chronicles, [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10435.44s)]
*  and we did all those shows that we did, [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10437.16s)]
*  we were doing a version of ONA. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10439.720000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10442.4s)]
*  When we did those shows at the Ice House in Pasadena [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10443.24s)]
*  where you would go on stage, [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10445.880000000001s)]
*  and then the comics would switch out [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10447.6s)]
*  depending on who's on stage. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10451.12s)]
*  Who's up? [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10452.28s)]
*  How much time do I have? [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10453.16s)]
*  And it was right across the hallway. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10454.24s)]
*  So we'd run from the podcast studio right to the stage. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10455.84s)]
*  Dude. It was so fun, man. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10458.68s)]
*  It was the best. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10459.76s)]
*  It was so fun. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10460.6s)]
*  It was so fun. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10461.44s)]
*  You should do something like that at your comedy club. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10462.28s)]
*  100% should do something like that. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10464.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10465.800000000001s)]
*  Well, we're gonna have it set up at the comedy club [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10467.32s)]
*  where when you guys are doing Kill Tony, [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10469.0s)]
*  there'll be another room [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10470.640000000001s)]
*  with an open mic going on simultaneously. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10471.880000000001s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10473.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so you could actually practice. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10474.640000000001s)]
*  So you might be able to do a set at the open mic [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10478.24s)]
*  and then go do Kill Tony. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10479.56s)]
*  Well, you'd be hot. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10481.199999999999s)]
*  You'll get off stage, you have a good set, [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10482.16s)]
*  and then go bang it out on the internet [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10483.88s)]
*  in front of hundreds of thousands of people. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10485.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10487.44s)]
*  You know? [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10488.279999999999s)]
*  Can't wait. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10489.1s)]
*  Having a set up like we had back then [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10489.94s)]
*  was so encouraging for comedy. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10492.68s)]
*  Because that was when I was kicked out of the store [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10494.64s)]
*  and we were trying to find some other places to go [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10496.44s)]
*  and things to do. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10498.44s)]
*  So the Ice House became our spot for a long time. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10499.48s)]
*  That's where we met young Jamie. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10502.52s)]
*  They're gonna reopen soon. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10504.52s)]
*  Yeah, I heard. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10505.92s)]
*  I don't wanna see it so bad. [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10506.92s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what they did. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10507.880000000001s)]
*  They remodeled something, which is, it was perfect. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10508.84s)]
*  Like if I bought the Ice House, [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10514.800000000001s)]
*  I was like, we're not touching anything. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10515.880000000001s)]
*  Don't touch anything. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10517.32s)]
*  But it had a lot needed. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10518.56s)]
*  Ah, fix the toilet, that's it. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10520.0s)]
*  Ceilings, remember? [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10521.880000000001s)]
*  I would come into my studio [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10523.04s)]
*  and there would just be ceiling and water [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10525.56s)]
*  all over my shit every day. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10527.78s)]
*  But that's the thing about California. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10529.16s)]
*  There's leaky roofs and you don't find out about it [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10530.52s)]
*  until it only rains once a year. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10532.76s)]
*  Yeah, but that was just as old-ass. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10534.720000000001s)]
*  It used to be a real ice house. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10536.880000000001s)]
*  Back in the day, the Ice House was a place [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10538.800000000001s)]
*  where people would buy ice. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10541.16s)]
*  And then it was a music venue for a little while [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10542.960000000001s)]
*  and then it became the Ice House, the Comedy Club. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10545.76s)]
*  That place was the shit. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10549.0s)]
*  You know, it was such a good room [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10550.68s)]
*  that agents would not accept tapes from the Ice House [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10552.64s)]
*  because they thought it was too easy to kill there. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10557.08s)]
*  That's right. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10558.6s)]
*  That was almost like a cheat code [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10559.44s)]
*  because it felt like you were at a road show [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10561.44s)]
*  and you were like, oh, so the audiences, [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10564.68s)]
*  it wasn't LA audiences. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10566.28s)]
*  Yeah, they weren't jaded. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10567.64s)]
*  They were from Pasadena. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10568.64s)]
*  It was like regular people. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10570.16s)]
*  They weren't like industry people. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10571.48s)]
*  It was a totally different vibe. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10572.92s)]
*  It was like killing in Columbus or something like that. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10574.720000000001s)]
*  Well, we're kind of jaded because we live in Texas [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10577.48s)]
*  and it's the best audiences in the world. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10579.28s)]
*  They're the best. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10580.92s)]
*  You can't beat that Texas audience. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10581.76s)]
*  But we always used to say that about Texas. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10583.0s)]
*  Remember back in the day, we'd do the Addison Improv [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10585.2s)]
*  or the Laugh Factory or something like that, [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10587.56s)]
*  or the Laugh Stop, rather. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10588.94s)]
*  We were like, they're the best down here. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10590.36s)]
*  They're just fucking partying. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10591.56s)]
*  They're fun. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10592.6s)]
*  They're just fun fucking people. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10594.08s)]
*  And they're not poisoned by show business. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10596.24s)]
*  Used to go on that Dale show. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10600.039999999999s)]
*  Remember the radio show? [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10601.64s)]
*  He got let go recently. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10603.32s)]
*  Did he? [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10605.32s)]
*  Yeah, after how many years has he done that? [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10606.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, they all, you know. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10609.24s)]
*  I don't know what anybody could have done back then [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10615.6s)]
*  in terms of like do a podcast simultaneously [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10617.8s)]
*  because I think probably a lot of their contracts [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10621.0s)]
*  said they couldn't do that. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10623.16s)]
*  Because that's what happened with Anthony [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10624.44s)]
*  when Anthony was doing Live from the Compound, [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10625.96s)]
*  which is the most ridiculous show ever, [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10627.72s)]
*  and also inspired us. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10629.56s)]
*  The two things that inspired us the most [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10630.92s)]
*  were Tom Green for sure. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10632.2s)]
*  Because remember when we went to his house, [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10634.0s)]
*  we were like, holy shit, he's got a talk show. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10635.28s)]
*  But he did it almost like an internet version [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10638.0s)]
*  of a traditional talk show. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10640.48s)]
*  And then the other thing was ONA. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10642.4s)]
*  But ONA was the hang and then Anthony Kumia, [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10643.94s)]
*  you're like, whoa, you can do that from your house too? [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10647.76s)]
*  Where it's like, just you set this thing up, [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10650.16s)]
*  just like Tom Green did and just have chaos [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10653.539999999999s)]
*  and have Anthony Kumia style chaos. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10655.9s)]
*  Like, oh shit, there was all these things [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10659.18s)]
*  that set the table for us. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10661.26s)]
*  It was always so fun because every week [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10663.619999999999s)]
*  we'd find like a new microphone. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10665.42s)]
*  We'd upgrade, oh, the cameras. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10667.1s)]
*  That was so fun back then. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10671.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10671.859999999999s)]
*  Constant shopping. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10673.119999999999s)]
*  It's crazy back then how many people told us [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10674.82s)]
*  we were wasting our time. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10676.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10677.46s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10678.38s)]
*  Because it's like everybody thought [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10679.98s)]
*  it was just a giant waste of time. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10681.26s)]
*  Even Segura, Segura leaving the show, [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10683.78s)]
*  I was like, what is he doing? [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10685.86s)]
*  Remember he had a conversation with you? [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10687.34s)]
*  Why is he doing this? [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10689.54s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10692.22s)]
*  Now he's one of the biggest podcasters in the world. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10693.14s)]
*  I did a show Tuesday, Wednesday, [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10695.5s)]
*  and his new studio is like a legit [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10698.36s)]
*  production company studio with tons of employees. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10702.62s)]
*  Yeah, like way more employees than I have. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10705.98s)]
*  And everybody's running around doing different things. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10708.380000000001s)]
*  They have green rooms, like green screen rooms. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10710.64s)]
*  Danny Brown's room. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10713.16s)]
*  Danny Brown show. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10714.0s)]
*  Dr. Drew. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10715.48s)]
*  Danny Brown is funny as fuck. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10716.32s)]
*  Danny is hilarious. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10717.519999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, his show is so funny. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10718.439999999999s)]
*  He's like one of the great ranters. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10720.76s)]
*  There's a few people that are just so good at ranting. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10722.76s)]
*  It's such a beautiful skill to just be able [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10725.599999999999s)]
*  to talk shit about everything. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10727.48s)]
*  And the thing about your mom's house too [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10729.119999999999s)]
*  is they have those guys that are working there [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10730.8s)]
*  that are in the booth and they're all laughing too. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10732.72s)]
*  So Danny Brown's talking even more. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10734.8s)]
*  It's like the Tim Dillon situation [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10736.439999999999s)]
*  where he's got an audience of one. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10738.08s)]
*  You know? [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10739.96s)]
*  Which is nice. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10741.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10742.56s)]
*  Nice. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10743.4s)]
*  Nice. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10744.22s)]
*  Yeah, what's next buddy? [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10746.32s)]
*  You think virtual? [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10747.8s)]
*  I know you do a lot of stuff. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10748.64s)]
*  I'm still on virtual. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10749.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10750.32s)]
*  But you do it more like silly. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10751.16s)]
*  It's like fun stuff. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10752.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10753.56s)]
*  I mean, you know, I think what Metta's version [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10754.64s)]
*  of the future is not, I think it's more, [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10757.92s)]
*  a little bit different than that. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10761.439999999999s)]
*  I feel kind of bad that they're going bankrupt [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10762.599999999999s)]
*  and spending billions of dollars a year and shit like that. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10765.679999999998s)]
*  I feel that didn't work out as good as he thought it was. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10768.92s)]
*  It's not. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10771.36s)]
*  I remember when he came on the podcast, [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10772.2s)]
*  I was enthusiastic about it. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10773.28s)]
*  I'm like, well, he's fucking hit home runs every time. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10774.68s)]
*  But the thing is like, people are still weirded out [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10777.8s)]
*  about putting goggles on and going to a world [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10780.48s)]
*  that's not really there. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10782.44s)]
*  Right. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10783.4s)]
*  No, like I was talking to Christina and Tom the other day [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10784.28s)]
*  and Christina's like, fucking, you look so stupid. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10788.18s)]
*  Like I hate it. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10790.84s)]
*  And like, I hate looking at people doing the VR thing [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10791.68s)]
*  because I guess she goes to the mall [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10795.52s)]
*  and does all that shit all the time with her kids, you know? [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10796.72s)]
*  And Tom was like, oh, I want to buy one. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10799.72s)]
*  So he's going to get one. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10801.12s)]
*  But I'll tell you what they're good for. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10802.880000000001s)]
*  It's workouts. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10804.4s)]
*  Workouts, yeah. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10805.24s)]
*  Like boxing. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10806.08s)]
*  Like exercise. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10806.92s)]
*  You do the boxing one, you will get a fucking serious workout. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10807.76s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10811.08s)]
*  Cause it's like, it forces you to punch [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10812.0s)]
*  and you're like punching in the air, [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10813.92s)]
*  like just punching the air with nothing, [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10815.76s)]
*  not hitting anything is actually kind of more exhausting [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10817.0s)]
*  sometimes, especially when you're punching fast. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10820.2s)]
*  Cause you got to decelerate too. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10822.4s)]
*  Whereas when you're punching something like a heavy bag, [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10824.04s)]
*  you can just punch it and hit it. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10825.8s)]
*  There's a different thing. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10827.84s)]
*  You'll be able to generate more power [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10828.8s)]
*  by punching and hitting it. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10830.28s)]
*  Cause you're hitting it and you're actually almost [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10831.199999999999s)]
*  like lifting weights when you're pushing the bag off. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10832.76s)]
*  Cause there's a resistance. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10834.8s)]
*  So it builds your power. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10836.0s)]
*  But for a workout, man, working out, [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10837.32s)]
*  like having those little things on your hands [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10839.8s)]
*  and you see the boxing gloves in front of you [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10841.64s)]
*  and the guy comes at you, it's wild, man. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10842.84s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10845.28s)]
*  The only problem I think is it's too big right now [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10846.199999999999s)]
*  to really take it to the next level for working out. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10848.72s)]
*  Like it gets hot. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10852.0s)]
*  It's, you know, you got this plastic thing on your face. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10853.0s)]
*  But I think in the future, when it gets smaller, [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10856.28s)]
*  when it gets more like goggles or glasses. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10857.8s)]
*  It'll be like those Brian Bosworth sunglasses. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10859.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10861.8s)]
*  Once it gets to that. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10862.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10863.48s)]
*  Remember those? [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10864.32s)]
*  Yeah, what are those, Oakleys? [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10865.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10866.0s)]
*  Remember the Boz? [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10867.16s)]
*  Yeah, fucking Boz. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10868.039999999999s)]
*  Remember that guy? [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10870.119999999999s)]
*  What happened to that guy? [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10870.96s)]
*  Well, he became a movie. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10872.039999999999s)]
*  He was a football player, but he fucked his shoulder up. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10873.16s)]
*  And then he went from football to the movies. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10875.44s)]
*  He was a movie star in like a couple of movies. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10877.32s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10879.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10880.64s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10881.48s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10882.32s)]
*  Is he still around? [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10883.16s)]
*  Where's Brian Bosworth? [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10884.24s)]
*  Yeah. There he is. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10887.48s)]
*  What happened? [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10888.32s)]
*  He was all over the place for a while. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10889.16s)]
*  Handsome bastard. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10890.0s)]
*  Look at that handsome bastard. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10890.84s)]
*  God, where's Bosworth? [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10892.16s)]
*  There's a few of those football players [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10893.0s)]
*  that transitioned to become movie stars [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10894.84s)]
*  that just gave it up. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10896.36s)]
*  Like Howie Long was another one. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10897.18s)]
*  Remember that? [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10898.199999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10899.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10899.88s)]
*  Howie's on TV still. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10900.72s)]
*  Howie's on TV as a football analyst, right? [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10902.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10904.16s)]
*  Yeah, but he was doing, [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10905.0s)]
*  he was a movie star for a while, remember? [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10906.36s)]
*  Frigerator Perry, remember him? [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10909.039999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, but I don't think he did movies. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10910.76s)]
*  So Bosworth is still around? [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10913.08s)]
*  What does he do now? [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10914.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10915.76s)]
*  Dude, he was a tank. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10916.58s)]
*  That's him now. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10917.42s)]
*  Wow. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10918.26s)]
*  Still a handsome bastard. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10919.08s)]
*  You're still around. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10919.92s)]
*  Look at him. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10920.76s)]
*  Looks better now. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10921.6s)]
*  Look at that sultry looking motherfucker. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10922.42s)]
*  Yeah, but he, apparently he knew his shoulder [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10925.56s)]
*  was fucked up when he got signed. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10927.96s)]
*  But he was like a giant superstar. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10929.84s)]
*  I think it was like, part of it was his, [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10931.76s)]
*  it was a talented player, [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10933.88s)]
*  but part of it was the look and the image and all this shit. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10935.039999999999s)]
*  Where's he at now? [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10938.14s)]
*  Oklahoma. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10939.68s)]
*  He's in Oklahoma? [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10940.58s)]
*  Is he still around? [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10941.42s)]
*  He's in a bunch of movies. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10943.039999999999s)]
*  Did The Longest Yard, One Tough Bastard, Stone Cold. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=10943.88s)]

*  We always had a friend with a single dad [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11221.28s)]
*  who would have either the stack of magazines [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11223.24s)]
*  or he had the black box. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11226.800000000001s)]
*  He had access to the channel that everyone had. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11228.16s)]
*  The black box. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11231.4s)]
*  Skinamax. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11232.24s)]
*  No one else had that box. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11233.08s)]
*  It was like the single dad had the box. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11233.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11235.6s)]
*  Well, before there was that option to get porn, [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11237.119999999999s)]
*  you had to jerk off through your memory. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11240.24s)]
*  Or you had to get a lingerie catalog. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11241.96s)]
*  Chacey Penny Christmas catalog. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11243.279999999999s)]
*  You weren't inspired. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11245.56s)]
*  Remember those big books? [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11247.8s)]
*  Every year you would get the big book [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11248.72s)]
*  and you would go through all the toys [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11250.44s)]
*  and you had to write down the numbers [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11252.4s)]
*  and order it through the mail. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11254.039999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11256.16s)]
*  That's right. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11257.68s)]
*  People got addicted to ordering through catalogs. [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11260.039999999999s)]
*  Because it's just like people are addicted [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11263.08s)]
*  to internet shopping. [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11264.96s)]
*  People are addicted to internet shopping. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11266.6s)]
*  I'm addicted to internet shopping. [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11268.32s)]
*  It's so addictive. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11269.16s)]
*  I need that money clip. [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11271.4s)]
*  I was so high the other day I couldn't remember [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11273.96s)]
*  how you bought a plane ticket without the internet. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11275.359999999999s)]
*  I was like, how did that even happen? [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11277.84s)]
*  I don't remember ever doing that in my entire life, [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11280.16s)]
*  but yeah, I guess it was a phone call. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11281.8s)]
*  I remember when you bought a plane ticket [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11283.84s)]
*  you didn't even have to show a license. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11285.8s)]
*  You didn't even have to show who you were. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11287.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11289.88s)]
*  You just had a ticket. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11290.72s)]
*  You'd just be able to show them the ticket. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11291.96s)]
*  You'd give them the ticket, you'd get on the plane. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11293.519999999999s)]
*  Like someone could give you their ticket. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11295.64s)]
*  Smoking. [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11297.56s)]
*  I remember those days. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11298.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11299.24s)]
*  We'd just show up to the airport too [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11300.08s)]
*  and be like, I need to get to Ohio. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11300.92s)]
*  Okay, three hours from now there's a flight to here. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11302.64s)]
*  There's three seats left. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11305.24s)]
*  You can have one of them. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11306.359999999999s)]
*  That's craziness. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11308.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, how did you, you just went to the airport [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11309.279999999999s)]
*  or did you buy tickets in advance? [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11312.08s)]
*  I think over the phone. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11313.88s)]
*  I think you would call them. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11315.08s)]
*  Sometimes you would buy it months in advance. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11315.92s)]
*  Do they send them to you? [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11318.32s)]
*  I think so. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11319.16s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11320.0s)]
*  I figure I remember. [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11320.84s)]
*  How'd they write, they wrote their books with a feather? [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11321.68s)]
*  Fuckin' idea. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11323.519999999999s)]
*  And there was no printing press at all. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11324.6s)]
*  That, it's so crazy how much things have changed [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11327.0s)]
*  just inside of our life. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11329.519999999999s)]
*  Now you just, every ticket's on your phone [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11331.519999999999s)]
*  and you walk by the thing, bloop, scans your ticket. [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11333.199999999999s)]
*  Crazy. [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11336.88s)]
*  The TSA didn't really have any technology. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11337.72s)]
*  It was like, you pinky square, you don't have anything on you. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11339.68s)]
*  I don't think it existed. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11341.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think there was. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11342.6s)]
*  There was a metal detector maybe, but that's about it. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11343.439999999999s)]
*  No, you used to be able to go right to the gate. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11345.76s)]
*  Remember? [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11347.92s)]
*  Yes, and you'd go to the gate and meet your friends. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11348.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11349.84s)]
*  Yeah, I went and met my dad and they let me [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11350.68s)]
*  go back on the plane and sit in the thing. [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11352.24s)]
*  Oh wow. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11354.4s)]
*  I'd have been like, I wanna go home. [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11355.24s)]
*  Now if you leave your phone on the plane, [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11356.08s)]
*  you can't go back on the plane to get your phone. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11357.48s)]
*  What do you expect me to do? [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11360.44s)]
*  I'm still in the airport. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11362.28s)]
*  I just got off the plane. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11363.32s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11364.48s)]
*  But back then, they didn't have to take off your shoes. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11365.92s)]
*  It was that Richard Spencer guy, that shoe bomber. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11369.24s)]
*  Once he tried to blow himself up and they'd say, [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11371.76s)]
*  all right, no charge for luggage. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11374.4s)]
*  Remember that? [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11376.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11377.32s)]
*  It was just a weird, it was just a different world [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11378.279999999999s)]
*  back then, man. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11380.88s)]
*  That you could smoke on a plane is so crazy. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11382.32s)]
*  Dice Clay used to have a joke about it. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11386.56s)]
*  About I could smoke here, but I can't smoke here. [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11388.24s)]
*  We're in a fucking tube. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11391.439999999999s)]
*  He had this whole bit about smoking on a plane. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11393.32s)]
*  There's a video that just came out a couple days ago [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11396.96s)]
*  of this guy, like last week, just packed a plane [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11399.0s)]
*  and just pulls out a cigarette and starts smoking it. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11403.359999999999s)]
*  It's just so weird to see. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11407.24s)]
*  Everyone's freaking out looking at him. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11408.08s)]
*  Is he really smoking a cigarette? [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11409.24s)]
*  Yeah, that used to be normal. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11412.28s)]
*  I remember there's an old video of Bertrand Russell. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11414.16s)]
*  And Bertrand Russell would not fly [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11417.28s)]
*  unless he could smoke on a plane. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11419.400000000001s)]
*  And he was talking about it. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11421.6s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11422.560000000001s)]
*  It's a crazy, crazy video because here's this cherished [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11423.400000000001s)]
*  intellectual who just loved tobacco [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11428.04s)]
*  and he could not be without tobacco. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11430.84s)]
*  The sort of conventional self-indulgencies or vices [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11432.16s)]
*  like drinking tobacco and so on. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11435.16s)]
*  Which is your favorite one? [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11436.76s)]
*  Oh, tobacco. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11438.119999999999s)]
*  I smoke a pipe all day long, [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11439.56s)]
*  except when I'm eating or sleeping. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11441.52s)]
*  Hasn't that shortened your life? [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11443.28s)]
*  Well, they used to say it would when I first took to it, [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11445.56s)]
*  but I took to it some 70 years ago. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11448.4s)]
*  So it doesn't seem to have had a very great effect so far. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11451.76s)]
*  In fact, you know, on one occasion it saved my life. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11456.6s)]
*  I was in an airplane and a man was getting a seat for me [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11462.6s)]
*  and I said, get me a seat in the smoking part. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11469.68s)]
*  He said, if I can't smoke, I should die. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11472.12s)]
*  And sure enough, there was an accident, a bad accident, [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11474.56s)]
*  and all the people in the non-smoking part [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11478.720000000001s)]
*  of the plane were drowned. [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11481.16s)]
*  And the people in the smoking part jumped [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11482.92s)]
*  into the Norwegian shard where we landed and were saved. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11485.92s)]
*  So I owe my life to smoking. [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11490.8s)]
*  Did you have? [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11492.84s)]
*  What the hell? [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11493.84s)]
*  That was back when planes crashed all the time. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11495.72s)]
*  All the time. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11497.92s)]
*  That's one thing where technology got way better. [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11498.759999999998s)]
*  Preventing plane crashes. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11503.8s)]
*  Plane crashes were so normal. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11505.72s)]
*  They were so fucking normal. [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11508.359999999999s)]
*  They happened all the time. [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11510.519999999999s)]
*  Like they would happen like once a month. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11513.759999999998s)]
*  The plane just drives itself pretty much nowadays. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11515.08s)]
*  Yeah, and they're just really good at knowing when to fly [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11517.199999999999s)]
*  and when not to fly. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11519.96s)]
*  They have better understanding of the weather conditions. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11520.8s)]
*  Back then, they would just, is it windy? [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11523.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's all good to go. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11525.0s)]
*  Let's go, bitch. [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11526.599999999999s)]
*  They'd just go up. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11527.439999999999s)]
*  When would we be going 100 miles an hour sideways? [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11528.759999999998s)]
*  I wonder if they even had a way of measuring it back then [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11531.4s)]
*  accurately, like at distance. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11533.64s)]
*  Like, you know, if you're flying over the country, [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11535.8s)]
*  they know now where the patches of turbulence are [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11537.199999999999s)]
*  and they avoid them. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11539.48s)]
*  You know, they're going through a rough spot, [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11540.919999999998s)]
*  but we're going to clear this and go to the next. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11542.439999999999s)]
*  And there's nothing up above it. [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11544.119999999999s)]
*  So they knew where, they know where the wind is now. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11545.64s)]
*  Still, I was flying back from Detroit [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11549.0s)]
*  and we were in the middle of a thunderstorm. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11551.2s)]
*  It was creepy, dude. [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11553.039999999999s)]
*  It was creepy looking out the window on the way to Austin. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11554.48s)]
*  We couldn't land in Austin. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11556.72s)]
*  We wound up landing somewhere else. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11557.72s)]
*  And then we had to transport to Austin. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11559.48s)]
*  Wow. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11561.56s)]
*  Yeah, it was sketchy. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11562.4s)]
*  It was sketchy. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11563.84s)]
*  Once in a while, that shit still happens. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11565.4s)]
*  And it's always when I'm stoned too. [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11567.0s)]
*  I'm like, why did this happen to happen? [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11568.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11569.6s)]
*  Well, it's most of the time when I'm on an airplane. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11570.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11573.64s)]
*  I don't like to be on airplanes sober. [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11574.48s)]
*  Fuck that. [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11575.68s)]
*  Like, what am I going to do? [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11576.52s)]
*  I have zero responsibility for three hours. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11577.52s)]
*  Why would I be sober? [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11579.560000000001s)]
*  Right. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11580.48s)]
*  You know? [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11581.32s)]
*  But it's just watching the lightning in the sky [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11583.16s)]
*  while you're flying around. [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11585.52s)]
*  You realize, I'm just floating in air here [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11586.28s)]
*  in the middle of an electrical storm. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11588.640000000001s)]
*  This is such a bad idea. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11590.32s)]
*  That's how people got, that's how people go. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11595.28s)]
*  Happens all the time. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11597.44s)]
*  Especially the small planes. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11599.24s)]
*  Especially if you know the Clintons. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11600.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11601.4s)]
*  Especially the private jets that everyone's doing nowadays. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11602.560000000001s)]
*  Those are even scarier during storms. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11605.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, man. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11607.92s)]
*  For sure. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11608.76s)]
*  Yeah, but they're all scary, man. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11609.72s)]
*  It's a metal fucking thing in the sky [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11611.4s)]
*  while it's lightning is crackling. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11613.199999999999s)]
*  The thing about Texas as opposed to California [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11615.279999999999s)]
*  is that it rains a lot here. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11617.8s)]
*  We get to experience rain. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11619.519999999999s)]
*  I fucking love it. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11621.16s)]
*  I love it, but it's so violent. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11622.68s)]
*  Compared to even like, you know, Ohio. [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11625.72s)]
*  We used to have thunderstorms all the time. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11627.64s)]
*  There's something about Texas, [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11629.199999999999s)]
*  and I think it must be because of the ocean being around it [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11630.199999999999s)]
*  or near or something like that. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11633.199999999999s)]
*  What about California? [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11634.039999999999s)]
*  The ocean's near that. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11634.92s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, I just mean the lightning so much. [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11635.72s)]
*  Like when it's a lightning storm out here, [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11639.119999999999s)]
*  our whole house rumbles and it's deeper and it's very- [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11641.839999999998s)]
*  I think, I don't know, but I'm guessing [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11645.4s)]
*  that's because there's more moisture here. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11647.48s)]
*  It's more, there's more humidity. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11649.92s)]
*  So I'd imagine that has something to do, is that? [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11652.039999999999s)]
*  Not only would correct, [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11655.92s)]
*  but I think it has more to do with atmospheric pressure [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11656.96s)]
*  and things like to that. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11659.24s)]
*  And the jet stream doesn't really go down [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11660.92s)]
*  through Southern California a ton. [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11662.519999999999s)]
*  And here is like, right on the spot [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11663.84s)]
*  where everything gets mixed up. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11666.24s)]
*  It's fucking scary sometimes. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11667.84s)]
*  Scary shit is tornadoes. [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11669.519999999999s)]
*  And the wind. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11670.359999999999s)]
*  I remember watching this video. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11671.64s)]
*  It was outside of Dallas. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11672.92s)]
*  It was on television and there were semi trucks [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11674.119999999999s)]
*  that were flying through the air. [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11675.96s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11677.56s)]
*  The fucking, a semi truck just floating around the air [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11680.119999999999s)]
*  like a paper cup. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11683.16s)]
*  It was floating around the sky. [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11684.72s)]
*  This twister touched down on this area that had semis. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11686.359999999999s)]
*  It was fucking nuts. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11689.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that tornado from four months ago, [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11691.64s)]
*  it was like literally five miles from my house. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11693.76s)]
*  Went through a huddle [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11695.84s)]
*  and just destroyed all those things in huddle. [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11696.68s)]
*  What did it destroy? [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11698.960000000001s)]
*  Houses? [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11699.800000000001s)]
*  Houses, a shopping center, [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11700.640000000001s)]
*  like tore through all these, like this neighborhood. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11701.800000000001s)]
*  There's this drone footage of this neighborhood [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11704.880000000001s)]
*  and every single roof is like missing. [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11707.12s)]
*  Except there will be like one house that's untouched [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11709.84s)]
*  and then everything else around is just bombed. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11711.960000000001s)]
*  This is this wild video of this guy. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11714.36s)]
*  He's driving in his car at night [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11716.960000000001s)]
*  and they're trying to get away from a tornado [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11718.28s)]
*  and it's dark out so you can't see it. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11720.12s)]
*  But every now and then the lightning cracks [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11722.04s)]
*  and you see the tornado in the distance. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11723.960000000001s)]
*  And this guy doesn't even know, [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11726.12s)]
*  is he going the right way? [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11728.240000000002s)]
*  What if it turns directions? [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11729.28s)]
*  I mean, is he listening to the Doppler radar [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11730.68s)]
*  at every second of every day? [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11733.0s)]
*  So watch this guy's driving [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11734.28s)]
*  and look at that. [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11735.800000000001s)]
*  Look at that fucking tornado in the distance. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11736.640000000001s)]
*  Imagine that's a monster. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11738.640000000001s)]
*  It's like a King Kong just running at you, [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11739.68s)]
*  a thousand feet tall. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11743.44s)]
*  But it's crazy because you only see it [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11745.04s)]
*  when the sky flashes with lightning. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11747.640000000001s)]
*  Other than that, it's just dark [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11750.080000000002s)]
*  and then you get a sense of where this thing is going. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11752.16s)]
*  But you're just guessing. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11753.4s)]
*  You're just hoping the lightning still keeps going [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11754.24s)]
*  so you can get a sense of where it's going. [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11756.56s)]
*  Look at the cars going. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11758.12s)]

*  Oh my God. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11761.4s)]
*  Imagine that now it's like the year of BC 2000 [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11762.24s)]
*  and you're seeing this. Oh my God. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11766.2s)]

*  Do you get to the cave? [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11771.36s)]
*  I guess you have to get to the cave. [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11773.28s)]
*  Would you have ever seen a tornado before? [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11774.720000000001s)]
*  You know, like did they even know what the fuck that was? [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11776.960000000001s)]
*  Probably thought it was a monster or something. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11778.68s)]
*  Well, you got to think the Plains Indians for sure saw that. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11780.44s)]
*  They lived in those areas. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11783.0s)]
*  They for sure saw something like that. [[03:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11784.4s)]
*  Fuck, did they have, [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11786.720000000001s)]
*  did the Native Americans have an expression for tornadoes? [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11787.800000000001s)]
*  See what that is. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11791.92s)]
*  They probably had a whole mythology attached to tornadoes. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11793.24s)]
*  They believe tornadoes were living things [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11796.480000000001s)]
*  according to this article I just quickly pulled up. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11797.92s)]
*  Dasani believes some tornadoes that were kindred spirits [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11801.2s)]
*  that could never harm them. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11803.560000000001s)]
*  Others believed they were a cleansing agent [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11805.04s)]
*  sweeping away negative things in life. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11807.480000000001s)]
*  That's nice. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11810.6s)]
*  I'm sure that each one had a different. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11812.28s)]
*  Living things, the sky monster. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11813.52s)]
*  Ooh. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11816.560000000001s)]
*  I wish I had been. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11818.76s)]
*  What if that was what they thought dragons were? [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11819.6s)]
*  You know, there's someone with a tail [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11820.44s)]
*  and they're like, it's the fucking tornado that showed up. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11821.6s)]
*  Yep. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11823.92s)]
*  It ate everything. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11824.880000000001s)]
*  What if dragons were real? [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11825.800000000001s)]
*  Like in that fucking Matthew McConaughey movie. [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11827.2s)]
*  Remember that movie? [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11829.76s)]
*  That movie was the shit. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11830.880000000001s)]
*  I bet dragons could be real. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11832.0s)]
*  Back when Matthew McConaughey was jacked. [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11833.800000000001s)]
*  He was fucking great in that movie. [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11837.52s)]
*  What's his name was in that movie too? [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11839.32s)]
*  Christian Bale. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11841.48s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11842.32s)]
*  What was that movie called? [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11843.16s)]
*  Rain of Fire. [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11845.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11846.64s)]
*  Rain of Fire. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11847.48s)]
*  That was a good movie. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11848.32s)]
*  That's a good fucking dragon movie. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11849.4s)]
*  The dragons, they ate carbon. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11852.04s)]
*  They had to burn everything to eat. [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11854.0s)]
*  That's right. [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11855.12s)]
*  So everything, they burn everything down [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11856.08s)]
*  and then they would eat whatever was charred. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11857.8s)]
*  That's what they ate. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11859.64s)]
*  That's why they had fire. [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11860.48s)]
*  And they lived in the center of the earth [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11861.56s)]
*  and they were in the middle of a mining thing. [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11862.8s)]
*  Yes. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11864.76s)]
*  Fuck yeah, that was good. [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11866.8s)]
*  And those were the first game of thrones type dragons [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11868.28s)]
*  in a movie. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11872.039999999999s)]
*  Because they were like game of thrones dragons. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11872.88s)]
*  They weren't, they were like mythology dragons. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11874.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11878.72s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11879.56s)]
*  There's a video of Forrest Galante on here [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11880.4s)]
*  talking about dragons. [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11881.64s)]
*  I've seen him going around recently. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11882.96s)]
*  Oh really? [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11884.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's just. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11884.96s)]
*  He's coming on soon, play that. [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11885.78s)]
*  I'm gonna find it. [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11887.4s)]
*  They just bring up the point of like, [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11888.24s)]
*  they show up everywhere all over the world [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11889.84s)]
*  in all sorts of mythology and they all look the same. [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11891.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good point. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11894.0s)]
*  What do you think they were? [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11896.36s)]
*  Why do you think they thought they had wings? [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11897.64s)]
*  Pterodactyls? [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11901.279999999999s)]
*  Maybe. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11902.88s)]
*  Pterodactyls were probably dragons. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11903.72s)]
*  You like these kind of far out there ideas. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11905.119999999999s)]
*  That was on our show. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11906.92s)]
*  How do you like this idea? [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11907.76s)]
*  There's a group of people that say that dragons were real [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11908.58s)]
*  and I'll explain. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11912.439999999999s)]
*  So around the same time period in China, South America, [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11913.779999999999s)]
*  Africa, all these different, Rome, all these places, [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11918.0s)]
*  images depicted people fighting dragons, right? [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11921.08s)]
*  And every dragon was slightly different [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11923.4s)]
*  but it was all a giant scaly animal that could fly. [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11925.24s)]
*  So when you break that down, you think about the fact [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11929.56s)]
*  that large birds had a hard time being fossilized [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11932.6s)]
*  because their bones are so porous, right? [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11934.8s)]
*  So because bones, they have like hollowish bones, [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11936.64s)]
*  they break down very easily and they don't fossilize. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11939.46s)]
*  The reason there's no fossils of dragons [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11941.66s)]
*  is because they had bird bones [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11943.82s)]
*  and they were actually very delicate animals. [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11945.48s)]
*  But a handful of these small population [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11947.44s)]
*  of these giant flying lizards existed. [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11951.34s)]
*  They ended it there but yeah. [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11955.68s)]
*  That was right, I remember that now. [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11957.28s)]
*  My memory's gone. [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11958.52s)]
*  Too many podcasts. [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11960.64s)]
*  Do you know what I did the other day? [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11962.28s)]
*  Someone told me about this guy and was like, [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11964.08s)]
*  oh, he sounds really cool. [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11965.68s)]
*  I Googled him, he's been on the show. [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11966.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11968.4s)]
*  What? [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11969.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11970.5s)]
*  There's one, Billy Corgan, I clearly remember him. [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11971.34s)]
*  From Smashing Pumpkins. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11974.04s)]
*  Yeah, it was over five years ago. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11974.880000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11976.28s)]
*  I was like, what? [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11977.12s)]
*  Whoa. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11978.08s)]
*  Yeah, my memory's trash, it's getting worse. [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11979.28s)]
*  It's just, my memory is too much. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11981.76s)]
*  There's too much in there. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11984.04s)]
*  Every now and then I'll pull something out of my ass. [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11985.6s)]
*  I'm like, how do I even remember that? [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11987.2s)]
*  But I think right now my hard drive is beyond full. [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11989.34s)]
*  My disks are skipping and I try to incorporate [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11992.480000000001s)]
*  new information and every time I do [[03:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11996.12s)]
*  I have to delete some old shit. [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11997.640000000001s)]
*  It's like that thing, Dunbar's number, [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=11999.6s)]
*  where you can only keep a certain amount of people [[03:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12003.04s)]
*  in your life, intimate friendships. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12005.28s)]
*  We've talked about this like 10 times. [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12008.240000000002s)]
*  We forgot already. [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12009.84s)]
*  Well actually we talked about it recently [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12011.480000000001s)]
*  and Jamie pulled it up that it actually is scaled. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12013.0s)]
*  It's like, there's like an X amount [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12015.6s)]
*  that are like your close friends, [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12018.52s)]
*  but there are the ones that are like distant acquaintances [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12019.72s)]
*  and the number gets bigger and bigger. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12021.92s)]
*  It gets to be like 1,500 people or something like that. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12023.48s)]
*  There's different scales of explanation. [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12025.4s)]
*  There it goes, it goes to 1,500. [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12027.2s)]
*  Go back to that one, that last one. [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12028.72s)]
*  See, there's all these like, there's five people [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12031.48s)]
*  that are really close to you and then there's 15 [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12033.68s)]
*  close friends and then 35 acquaintances [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12035.08s)]
*  and 150 people you know and so this is, [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12037.08s)]
*  as it gets further off there's like more and more distance [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12040.04s)]
*  and you think about guys like us who have had podcasts [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12043.56s)]
*  with thousands of people, thousands of people. [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12046.64s)]

*  probably over thousands, over a thousand at least. [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12061.48s)]
*  More than that. At least. [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12064.88s)]

*  and you forget about them. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12078.320000000002s)]
*  And you're like oh yeah, Henry Cho. [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12079.52s)]

*  there was a prop guy that was like really popular [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12097.759999999998s)]
*  at one point in time. [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12100.8s)]
*  I was trying to remember his name. [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12101.64s)]
*  He was a prop guy that was popular in like the 1980s [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12103.4s)]
*  and he had like a bag of eye boogers that he pulled out. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12106.32s)]
*  Like a jar. [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12109.32s)]

*  He like pulled it out. [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12111.759999999998s)]
*  I forget his name but it was funny. [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12113.88s)]
*  But he was like before Carrot Top, [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12116.24s)]
*  that was the genre of comedy. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12117.88s)]
*  You'd see a lot of different. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12120.199999999999s)]
*  And then teams, there was team comedy. [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12121.88s)]
*  Now there's only like the Sklar Brothers. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12124.0s)]

*  Fat Johnny in the Round, a Red Johnny in the Round guy. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12129.68s)]
*  Those guys would murder. [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12132.6s)]
*  Those guys would murder. [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12134.12s)]
*  I remember those guys in New York, [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12135.32s)]
*  they would close with a rap. [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12136.6s)]
*  They had a rap. [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12138.32s)]
*  And if you had to follow that rap, you were fucked. [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12139.16s)]
*  Because it was so much energy and it all rhymed [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12141.54s)]
*  and they would close, boom. [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12143.6s)]
*  And everybody would go, ah. [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12144.68s)]
*  Then you had to go on afterwards. [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12146.44s)]
*  Hey, have you ever noticed? [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12147.44s)]
*  Shut the fuck up and rap. [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12149.0s)]
*  Like on the road, like if you went on after a guy [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12153.12s)]
*  who had a song, a guy who busted out a guitar [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12155.12s)]
*  and had a song, you were doomed. [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12157.36s)]

*  that had just dirty songs. [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12168.36s)]
*  Oh my God, he was an East Coast guy. [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12171.12s)]
*  He was really dirty songs. [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12173.800000000001s)]
*  It was like in the 80s. [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12178.44s)]
*  And he was super controversial, even in the 80s. [[03:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12180.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12182.76s)]

*  Did you ever see Bob Woods? [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12200.84s)]
*  No. [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12204.92s)]
*  Bob Woods is a guy people forgot about. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12205.76s)]
*  He was like a Long Island legend. [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12207.0s)]
*  Legend, hilarious guy. [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12209.4s)]
*  He does this show once. [[03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12212.039999999999s)]
*  And he's doing this show and there's kids in the audience. [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12214.0s)]
*  And he goes into this bit. [[03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12216.56s)]
*  And he's, I think the bit is talking about blow jobs. [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12218.359999999999s)]
*  And they go, Bob, Bob, Bob. [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12221.56s)]
*  There's kids in the crowd. [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12224.08s)]
*  He goes, let them learn. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12225.279999999999s)]
*  He just went right into the bit and crushed. [[03:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12228.32s)]
*  It is weird anytime there's kids in the audience. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12235.599999999999s)]
*  It's the worst. [[03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12237.679999999998s)]
*  Do you remember when the improv used to have [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12239.519999999999s)]
*  those high school shows? [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12240.72s)]
*  Those were crazy. [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12242.08s)]
*  These are 15 year olds in the audience. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12243.88s)]
*  And they would tell you, don't change your material. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12245.64s)]
*  Just do what you would normally do. [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12247.599999999999s)]
*  Why are you telling me this? [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12249.84s)]
*  That should be illegal. [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12250.92s)]
*  These guys literally shouldn't be here. [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12253.199999999999s)]
*  And there's some loophole where they're allowed to go. [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12255.48s)]
*  As long as they didn't drink, they're allowed for one show. [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12258.24s)]
*  They have a license to have 14 year olds in the crowd. [[03:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12260.76s)]
*  And you look at their faces. [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12264.84s)]
*  They couldn't even believe they're at a comedy show. [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12265.8s)]
*  They've never seen anything like it. [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12268.119999999999s)]
*  What a great teacher. [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12268.96s)]
*  How cool would that be though to be 14 [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12269.96s)]
*  and be able to do that? [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12272.08s)]
*  Yeah, because I was a grown man [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12275.64s)]
*  when I went to my first comedy show. [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12277.16s)]
*  Yeah, if you could, I mean, [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12278.84s)]
*  what a great way to recruit standups. [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12280.599999999999s)]
*  Get someone to be in the standup. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12282.439999999999s)]
*  Get them to see what it's like when they're really young [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12284.199999999999s)]
*  and be in the audience. [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12286.16s)]
*  Because most people, they watch standup, it's on television. [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12287.16s)]
*  And I always say that standup on television [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12290.039999999999s)]
*  is like 60 to 70% as good as it is when you're live. [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12291.84s)]
*  So if you see a special like Bill Burr [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12295.4s)]
*  that makes you laugh hysterically when you're at home, [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12297.560000000001s)]
*  imagine how good it would be to see Chris Rock in person. [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12300.12s)]
*  He's 50 feet from you, murdering. [[03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12304.12s)]
*  There's something about when you're there live. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12306.76s)]
*  It's like, you know who's really fucking funny? [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12310.0s)]
*  Adam Sandler. [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12312.32s)]
*  I saw him live in Vegas last weekend. [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12313.32s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12314.960000000001s)]
*  He was really funny, dude. [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12315.800000000001s)]
*  It's so Adam Sandler, it's so silly. [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12317.36s)]
*  A lot of music? [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12320.4s)]
*  Yeah, he does music, [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12321.24s)]
*  but he also does just straight standup. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12322.48s)]
*  The standup is, he has this bit [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12324.48s)]
*  about the way words are pronounced. [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12325.76s)]
*  I don't wanna fuck the bit up, but it's really funny, man. [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12327.880000000001s)]
*  With the end, I was like clapping. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12330.12s)]
*  I was like, what a great bit. [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12331.800000000001s)]
*  It's a great bit, man. [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12333.320000000002s)]
*  I don't wanna give it away, but it's a really good bit. [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12334.68s)]
*  Is he touring or was this just like one special? [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12337.08s)]
*  Wow, I would like to see. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12339.12s)]
*  And Rob Schneider opened up for him too. [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12340.960000000001s)]
*  He was really funny, man. [[03:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12342.400000000001s)]
*  Rob Schneider's really fucking funny. [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12343.68s)]
*  I hadn't seen Rob Schneider do standup in a long time. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12345.04s)]
*  He killed. [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12347.28s)]
*  It was funny, man. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12348.320000000002s)]
*  I was laughing hard. [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12349.28s)]
*  I was like, this is a good show, man. [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12350.2s)]
*  It was really funny. [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12351.800000000001s)]
*  It's great. [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12352.68s)]
*  But Adam is so, he's so Adam Sandler on stage. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12353.52s)]
*  He's like silly. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12357.439999999999s)]
*  Coming here in February. [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12358.279999999999s)]
*  In February, we're at the Moody. [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12359.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12361.439999999999s)]
*  Did you say hi to him? [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12362.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12363.119999999999s)]
*  I went backstage and said, what's up? [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12363.96s)]
*  He's a cool motherfucker. [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12366.039999999999s)]
*  Always has been. [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12367.519999999999s)]
*  He's just a regular guy. [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12368.4s)]
*  He's as normal as you. [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12370.0s)]
*  One of the ways he got to be so normal [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12371.599999999999s)]
*  is he works with the same people always. [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12373.279999999999s)]
*  He brings the same comics. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12375.439999999999s)]
*  He has them in movies. [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12376.88s)]
*  Occasionally brings in actresses [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12378.4s)]
*  and different people and actors that he doesn't know, [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12380.679999999998s)]
*  but the vibe is all the same [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12383.279999999999s)]
*  because everybody, the same directors, same writers, [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12384.76s)]
*  everybody's cool together and they all know each other. [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12388.2s)]
*  It's just a fun vibe. [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12391.2s)]
*  I did Zookeeper with him. [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12392.800000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12394.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I get to hang out with him. [[03:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12395.64s)]
*  He's just a great guy. [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12397.6s)]
*  He's just a cool motherfucker. [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12399.28s)]
*  And during the pandemic, [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12401.48s)]
*  me and my family watched every Adam Sandler movie [[03:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12402.72s)]
*  except for Little Nicky. [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12404.92s)]
*  We never got to Little Nicky. [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12405.76s)]
*  I like Little Nicky. [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12407.36s)]
*  I never saw it. [[03:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12408.36s)]
*  But we watched the Zohan. [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12409.92s)]
*  That's a fucking underrated movie, man. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12411.6s)]
*  He gets fun movies, man. [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12415.44s)]
*  They're so silly. [[03:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12416.28s)]
*  You can do it. [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12417.12s)]
*  They yell that out when Rob Schneider gets on stage, [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12417.960000000001s)]
*  by the way. [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12423.24s)]
*  He must hate that. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12424.08s)]
*  It's like when, remember when Chappelle would go on stage [[03:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12425.12s)]
*  and everybody would go, I'm rich, bitch. [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12427.2s)]
*  Or I'm Rick James, bitch. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12430.68s)]
*  They would do that. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12432.48s)]
*  They would yell out, I'm Rick James. [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12433.52s)]
*  I smoke rocks, Joe Rogan. [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12435.68s)]
*  There was a lot of that, man. [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12437.0s)]
*  When I- [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12438.24s)]
*  Super City's movie? [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12439.08s)]
*  Which one? [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12439.92s)]
*  Wrong Missy? [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12440.74s)]
*  Wrong Missy, no. [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12441.58s)]
*  It's from Adam Sandler's production company, you know? [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12442.4s)]
*  It's fucking really funny. [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12445.359999999999s)]
*  Of course it is. [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12446.199999999999s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12447.039999999999s)]
*  It's funny. [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12447.859999999999s)]

*  I'll have to see it. [[03:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12450.359999999999s)]
*  Did you know Mick Swartzen almost died? [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12451.199999999999s)]
*  Did you hear about that? [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12452.72s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12453.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12454.48s)]
*  He was in town the other day. [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12455.48s)]
*  Yeah, I missed him. [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12457.0s)]
*  I didn't get to just see him. [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12458.16s)]

*  I love him, too. [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12461.199999999999s)]
*  That whole crew he's got, fucking hilarious people, man. [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12462.56s)]
*  There's some funny ass fucking people [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12465.32s)]
*  they put in those movies. [[03:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12466.72s)]
*  But those movies never got any love. [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12467.96s)]
*  Like Happy Madison, all the critics shit on them. [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12469.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12471.92s)]
*  For whatever reason, audiences love them [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12473.76s)]
*  and critics hate them. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12475.4s)]
*  Because it was immature and stupid. [[03:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12476.24s)]
*  It was what the audience likes and not critics. [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12477.84s)]
*  But it's fun. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12480.04s)]
*  That's what it's supposed to be. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12480.800000000001s)]
*  It's like going to see an orchestra [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12482.56s)]
*  and you're upset that it's not Slayer. [[03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12485.56s)]
*  Right, yeah, exactly. [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12487.44s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[03:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12488.28s)]
*  It's like you know what it is. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12489.12s)]
*  You don't have to like it. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12490.6s)]
*  But if you don't like it, [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12492.2s)]
*  maybe you're not the right person to be reviewing it. [[03:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12493.24s)]
*  Because obviously there's an entertainment value to this [[03:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12495.68s)]
*  that a lot of people like. [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12498.36s)]
*  It'd be like somebody who hates comic books, [[03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12499.24s)]
*  like reviewing a comic book. [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12501.44s)]
*  Like that's not your thing. [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12503.32s)]
*  Right. [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12504.44s)]
*  Like for some people, comic books are awesome. [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12505.279999999999s)]

*  Sometimes I'll just leave my phone at home [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12558.36s)]
*  like if I'm going out and going to a restaurant [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12560.44s)]
*  or something, you know. [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12562.6s)]
*  What's super underrated is the talk to text feature. [[03:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12563.68s)]

*  Mm-hmm. [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12571.76s)]
*  Like if I'm in the car and someone sends me a text message, [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12572.6s)]
*  I don't have to take my hands off the steering wheel. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12574.96s)]
*  Yep. [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12576.68s)]

*  because you can sit there with a voice recorder on, [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12583.08s)]
*  you know, when you're on stage [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12585.92s)]

*  Yep. [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12591.28s)]
*  Recording your sets is so fucking important, man. [[03:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12592.12s)]
*  It's the best way to remember shit, [[03:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12594.1s)]
*  the best way to, you get a third party perspective. [[03:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12596.36s)]
*  You get to look at your shit from outside and listen to it. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12599.640000000001s)]
*  It's important. [[03:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12602.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12603.480000000001s)]

*  Yeah, and then you get two versions of it. [[03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12610.44s)]
*  Yeah, and I usually put it on the stool, [[03:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12612.0s)]
*  the phone on the stool facing the audience [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12615.16s)]
*  kind of sound and then, you know, [[03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12618.119999999999s)]

*  What, do you get a message there? [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12625.119999999999s)]
*  So you get distracted. [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12626.16s)]
*  That's the problem with those things. [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12627.08s)]
*  You're constantly getting emails and text messages. [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12629.6s)]
*  Well, you put it in airplane mode. [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12631.96s)]
*  Does it send pictures? [[03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12633.24s)]
*  Can you get a dick pic on that? [[03:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12634.119999999999s)]

*  And I think also in the comedy world, [[03:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12906.32s)]
*  it's achieved escape velocity [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12907.880000000001s)]
*  where people just wanna come to it. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12909.4s)]

*  to be a guest, to do standup on it. [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12912.5s)]
*  And it really can shape careers. [[03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12915.4s)]
*  And also it teaches comics to be really funny in one minute. [[03:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12917.48s)]
*  You can't be self-indulgent. [[03:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12920.56s)]

*  for young comics to learn that fast and that easy. [[03:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12935.56s)]

*  And it's fucking humbling. [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12943.619999999999s)]
*  It's humbling for people that think they can do standup [[03:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12946.84s)]
*  and they do one minute and find out they can't. [[03:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12949.08s)]
*  But it's also like watching David and Tony roast each other. [[03:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12951.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's ridiculous. [[03:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0oNgfRUCo&t=12954.439999999999s)]
