# Joe Rogan Experience #1392 - Zach Bitter
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 03, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofj3EHrK96U)
*  Sup, Zach.
*  Hey, how's it going?
*  Good, man.
*  How are you?
*  Good, good.
*  Thanks for having me back on.
*  My pleasure.
*  Hey, thanks for turning me into those shoes you wear too.
*  Those Ultras.
*  Oh, nice.
*  I started running with those.
*  Yeah.
*  I like them.
*  I like them a lot.
*  They're great.
*  Uh-huh.
*  Which ones?
*  You got the Lone Peak RSMs?
*  I've got whatever the trail ones are.
*  Okay.
*  You know, I like the wide foot, what's it called?
*  Footbox?
*  Foot-shit toebox, yeah.
*  Yeah, toebox.
*  That's what it's called.
*  Toebox.
*  I like them.
*  And I feel like this is what you wear, so it gets me excited when I'm running.
*  You know, it's really interesting, like when you dive into kind of the world of footwear
*  and stuff.
*  And I learned this recently.
*  The number one indicator of low injury risk, which is what runners are always looking for,
*  they're going to minimize risk.
*  So, comfort is the identifier for that.
*  So if you find yourself going into like a specialty running shop, ask them to try on
*  a variety of different pairs, a variety of different models, and find the one that's
*  most comfortable for you.
*  And that's probably going to lower your risk to the lowest you can get from your footwear
*  anyway.
*  What if you like really smooshy ones?
*  Aren't those supposed to be not so good for you?
*  Yeah, no, that's a good question.
*  I think it's one of those things where it's kind of half true, half not, where you kind
*  of have to look at what's the purpose of what you're doing.
*  So the way I kind of describe it is if I'm trying to strengthen my lower legs, you know,
*  I want that low cushion, that firm platform, because that's going to really activate the
*  muscles in the lower part of the leg.
*  But if I'm dealing with some lower leg issues or a little sore, I did a workout and my calves
*  are kind of sore, my ankles sore, then cushion can be great because it's going to relieve
*  that kind of initial impact on the lower part of your legs.
*  And the caveat, though, is those impact forces have to go somewhere.
*  So they're kind of going to move further up the kinetic chain.
*  So what I usually tell people, if you're dealing with lower leg pain or injury, then you might
*  want to consider something a little more cushioned.
*  If you want, if you're dealing with something like in your knees or your hips, then getting
*  rid of some of that cushion is going to just keep that kind of more precise foot plant
*  and maybe alleviate some of those impact forces from ending up in those areas.
*  But at the end of the day, the mechanics of it all are going to be the real driver.
*  You want your foot to come underneath a bent knee because you're using your legs as kind
*  of like a three foot spring, essentially.
*  So if you can get that foot plant under bent knee, it's going to absorb it in the way your
*  body intends versus absorbing it in a way that could maybe send those impact forces
*  into the wrong areas.
*  That's really interesting.
*  I was watching a video with this guy who was in his 70s who runs an under three hour marathon.
*  And he said that five years ago, he hired a coach, which is kind of crazy, like a 65
*  year old dude hiring a coach but trimmed a bunch of time off his marathon, I think more
*  than five minutes off of his marathon.
*  I think it was quite a bit more than five minutes.
*  And he was running for a long time before that.
*  But yet a coach sort of shortened his time in finishing a 26 mile race at 70 years old.
*  Yeah, it's never too late.
*  The bent knee is really important because a lot of folks who don't pay attention to
*  the history of footwear don't understand that this fat cushioned heel that everybody sort
*  of thinks of when you think of a running shoe and when you watch a lot of people run that
*  don't know any better, they run and they land on their heel, which is sort of something
*  that was created by Nike.
*  Is that what it was that created that fat bottomed heel thing?
*  Yeah, I think they were the first one to do the offset where it was traditionally, I think
*  it was like 12 millimeters where your heel would be that much higher than your forefoot.
*  But I think even with when we get into kind of like say heel striking versus forefoot
*  or midfoot striking, heel striking is another thing where it's not inherently bad.
*  It all comes down to what I was saying before where if you can heel strike but your foot
*  is still underneath that bent knee, you're probably not going to do anything too detrimental.
*  So like, it's not optimal, right?
*  It probably depends on the specific runner and their particular gait.
*  Yeah, there's you could have like extra long legs or something.
*  Maybe heel strike would work or extra short legs or what would it be?
*  Yeah, I don't know for sure if there's like a height thing that would do.
*  I think it would maybe just come with like the mechanics of the way the person learned
*  to run in the first place and just maybe some nuances with the way their body is kind
*  of more or less designed.
*  But I mean, there's heel striking folks that are very or not injury prone or have never
*  gotten injuries or hardly ever get injuries.
*  But usually I think if you're doing that, that's probably because you're under that
*  bent knee and you're not kind of having that point where your foot is out in front of your
*  knee and then you kind of have that straight leg but at an angle where it's going to be,
*  you know, not ideal for kind of absorbing those impacts.
*  Yeah, that's the real bad one, right?
*  Is when people are pigeon-toed, when their knees kind of bend in, which I do see quite
*  a bit.
*  That's got to be terrible for your knees, right?
*  Yeah, I mean, I couldn't say for sure.
*  But I think there's a lot of nuance and it ends up being kind of like an individual situation
*  with a lot of these cases.
*  So it's hard to know for sure.
*  There's probably people who can talk to mechanics better than me in the hill.
*  Right.
*  You just run.
*  Explain the record you broke.
*  You ran 24 in less, well, it was 100 miles and it's a 24-hour time period but you did
*  it in 11 hours and 40 what minutes?
*  Yeah, so it was, yeah, let me, I'll explain a little bit.
*  So it was, the event itself was called Six Days in the Dome and really what it was was
*  you could do anything from a 24-hour event to a 48-hour event to a six-day event and
*  just see how far you could run within that timeframe.
*  Six days.
*  Yeah, I know there's some crazy people out there.
*  So just wait till David Goggins finds that event.
*  But yeah, so I've been, it's interesting because there's not a lot of timed events that are
*  necessarily structured for 100 mile or for like 12 hours.
*  So a lot of times you find yourself jumping into some of these other events that are longer
*  in duration and just kind of using them as a way to try to run a fast 100-miler or a
*  fast 12-hour.
*  So the race director for that particular event had reached out to me because he's known me
*  for a while and knew that I was targeting fast 100-mile times and just said, hey, I've
*  got this cool event set up at the Olympic training facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
*  at the Pettit Center.
*  And I think it's gonna be pretty conducive for fast times.
*  And asked if I wanted to do it.
*  So I actually didn't have an ideal timeline that I would have normally wanted to work
*  with in terms of getting ready for it.
*  But training went really well and I went there targeting the 100-mile world record, which
*  was 11 hours, 28 minutes and 3 seconds prior to that and ended up running 11 hours, 19
*  minutes and 13 seconds for 100 miles.
*  And then since we have like this 100-mile distance and also this 12-hour timed event
*  kind of structure, you can find yourself, if you're under 12 hours, kind of double dipping
*  and getting two events for the price of one, I guess you could say.
*  So I kept running after I hit 100 miles and ended up going 104.88 miles total in the 12-hour
*  time frame.
*  So that was another record?
*  Yeah.
*  So there's two world records, 100 miles in 12 hours.
*  Dude, six minutes and 48 seconds for a pace for 100 miles is fucking bonkers.
*  That is so fast.
*  That's so crazy.
*  That's such a fast pace, man.
*  Yeah, you know, it's funny like when you look at it, because I think sometimes people look
*  at like 100 miles in 11 hours and 19 minutes and there's not a lot of context in their
*  mind unless they're kind of familiar with ultra marathon running.
*  But when you start to break it down into like the subcategories where it's like, well, that's
*  like four sub three-hour marathons in a row or I can't remember how many or what the 5K
*  time is.
*  It's like 31 5Ks at some time.
*  That's four sub three-hour marathons in a row.
*  Wow.
*  That's so crazy.
*  That's so fast.
*  And are you still eating mostly meat?
*  So this gets brought up quite a bit, I think, because I mean, I eat a ton of animal products
*  for sure.
*  But you know, I wouldn't classify myself as a quote unquote carnivore or quite in that
*  sense.
*  This is because the carnivore diet people want to claim you.
*  We discussed this kind of the last time you were here where you take in a lot of glucose
*  and you ramp up your carbohydrates considerably before a race.
*  Like what is your what is a daily diet?
*  Let's say in training, you're preparing for something like this.
*  What's a daily diet for you like?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah, let's jump into that.
*  I think there's nuance within that even, because when you think of my lifestyle, the way I
*  like describe it is if you took a calendar year and you grabbed a single day out of there
*  and you grabbed a day where I was like a peak training day versus a recovery day, those
*  are like so drastically different in terms of my energy and my my energy demands.
*  So like things tend to fluctuate quite a bit and change quite a bit.
*  And I think that's oftentimes what confuses people because they want to they look at what
*  I'm doing, say on race day, they look at what I'm doing on one of my big workout days or
*  my rest day and think that's what I'm doing across the board.
*  So when you get the folks saying, oh, well, Zach follows a carnivore diet, they're probably
*  looking at like a post race recovery day where then I might be eating almost all just animal
*  products, a lot of eggs, a lot of salmon, you know, red meat, that sort of stuff.
*  But if you pick a day out where I'm doing like a big training day, doing like a 30 mile
*  run or something like that, that's where I'm going to kind of bring back some of the carbohydrates
*  to try to supplement that activity.
*  And the best way to maybe describe it is, you know, there's like this this kind of train
*  low race high or this carb periodization concept that's getting more momentum behind it and
*  more studies and science behind it, too.
*  There's some interesting folks that are looking into this in more detail.
*  And if folks are really interested in doing a deep dive in it, there's a guy named Dr.
*  Mark Bubbs.
*  He wrote a book called Peak and he kind of dives into kind of like some of the nutrition
*  science where it's been and kind of where it's it's kind of heading.
*  And they highlight some of that.
*  And one of the big things they're starting to recognize that even with the elite athletes,
*  when you're periodizing your training like I do, you know, your nutrition should be being
*  periodized as well.
*  You know, the science is pretty clear that like if you're doing a workout and you take
*  in glucose or fructose, I think most science says a two to one ratio is ideal for maximizing
*  the amount you can take in.
*  Then you're going to give yourself an advantage.
*  That's like rocket fuel.
*  So then it becomes a question of like, do you need that 100 percent of the time or do
*  you even want to do it 100 percent of time?
*  Because when we look at it, it pauses you right here.
*  When you say glucose, two to one, like what do you mean by that?
*  And glucose to fructose.
*  Because what they found out is when they started doing a lot of like the exercise science and
*  nutrition was that the real limiter is your gut.
*  So like on paper.
*  So absorption.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh huh.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a finite amount you can absorb and you increase the amount you can absorb on
*  average if you have that two to one ratio versus all of one or the other.
*  So two glucose to one sucrose.
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  And now what are the different sources for glucose versus sucrose?
*  Like sucrose is simple sugar that you get.
*  Is that more like a refined sugar?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You I think like the way like most most like sports supplements and things like that are
*  going to be designed to kind of meet those those specific because they're looking at
*  the literature and they're seeing like, okay, this is how you operate.
*  It's like a power aid or a Gatorade or something like that would be a two to one.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd have to look to see exactly if they have that.
*  But my guess would be they would be if they're looking at the research and where that's kind
*  of that.
*  Um, but yeah.
*  So like really when the question that I think needs to be asked with a lot of this stuff
*  is like if I want to make a workout feel as easy as possible, if I'm trying, if I can
*  get in like say 60 grams of carbohydrate per hour, it's probably going to do that.
*  Like my pace, my perceived effort at that pace is probably going to feel easier.
*  But then you have to ask the question like how often do you need it to feel that easy?
*  So for me, the answer to that is like, well, if I'm doing something really strenuous or
*  something that's in a little bit of a gray area where it's just fast enough to dip into
*  the glycogen stores, but just slow enough that I can do it for quite a while and maybe
*  a couple hours, then you're kind of in this area where that could be an advantage for
*  you from a performance standpoint.
*  But if I'm going out for an easy run of like 60 to 90 minutes and it's going to be like
*  a two to three out of 10 perceived effort anyway, like there's no real need for me to
*  be hitting glucose during that or, you know, sports drink during that to make that feel
*  even easier yet.
*  Cause my goal isn't necessarily to, you know, make an easy run feel even easier, I guess
*  is the way to make it.
*  Like call a 90 minute run easy.
*  That was nothing, just a stroll, just a few dozen miles.
*  Well, and I think that that also brings up a really good point too, where like a lot
*  of this stuff when we're looking at carbohydrate usage and performance is we're looking at
*  elite athletes.
*  We're looking at folks that are training for like, you know, the Olympics, you know, sometimes
*  they're even Olympic medalists.
*  And that's just not a very good comparison, I think, to the average person who's out there
*  running because you know, their, their, their purposes are different, you know, their objectives
*  are different, their lives are very different.
*  Like one is doing basically everything around a specific specific date and distance and
*  trying to run as fast as they can on that date.
*  And another person may be trying to run as fast as they can, but there's so many other
*  factors in life, like their work, their relationships, their, you know, the level of training they're
*  actually able to have with the time they have.
*  And then also like, you know, managing their own health and nutrition because like, you
*  know, elite athletes don't have a very rosy picture in terms of long-term health either.
*  So for someone who's like, you know, maybe 10, 20 pounds overweight and is trying to
*  run to get into shape or trained to get into shape or something like that, they're probably
*  thinking just so much about health as they are about performance.
*  So for them to be, you know, shuttling in 60 grams of carbohydrate every hour during
*  training and racing is probably not the direction that they'd want to go.
*  Now when you get ready to do something like this hundred mile run, how many miles do you
*  run on a typical day and do you ramp that up or do you just give yourself a base and
*  know that you can push through?
*  Like, how do you handle that?
*  Yeah, so I'll build up my training.
*  The way I kind of describe it is like, I'm always focusing on specificity kind of being
*  king. So depending on the race, distance and the intensity is kind of how I'm going to
*  structure my workouts.
*  So the rule of thumb that I use is the closer I get to the workout, the more specific the
*  workouts I do are going to be towards that race, distance and intensity.
*  So for me, what that oftentimes means, since I'm training for like 100 mile distance races
*  is early in a training block, I might be doing some like shorter interval work like
*  VO2 max, like an example that would maybe be like a three minute kind of almost all
*  out effort followed by like a three minute recovery jog and then another three minute
*  interval like that.
*  Some of those real short interval sessions.
*  And how many of those would you do in a row?
*  How many sprints versus recovery?
*  Yeah, it'll depend.
*  I'll start like pretty easy on the first one.
*  When I first started, I might just do three by three on that.
*  And what my goal really is to every week is to kind of build volume within that.
*  So that first week, it might be just three of them.
*  But by like, say, the eighth week, I might do a total of like 24 to 27 minutes worth of
*  volume within that VO2 max context.
*  So it's really interesting because like, you know, I could go out on any one day and do
*  like maybe 10 of those.
*  But if I do that and then it takes me like a week and a half to recover from that session,
*  it's not nearly as probably effective as if I spread that out a little bit and said, did
*  like five by three and then five by three, three days after that.
*  Give your body a chance to recover and build versus just destroying it all in one and then
*  feeling like shit for a couple of weeks.
*  Exactly. I like to I like to call it micro stressing when I'm working with folks and my
*  own training. I'm like, we want to micro stress.
*  We want to stress you just enough to elicit a response and so you get stronger.
*  And then we want to do that over and over and over again.
*  You where I'm sure you are.
*  You know, Pavel Tatsulini is.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So he's got this sort of concept when it comes to weightlifting with kettlebells
*  in particular, called greasing the groove.
*  Yeah. Whereas instead of doing all these sets to failure, you would just do like half of
*  what you're capable of and then do it again in a more frequent pace.
*  Like do it again rather, you know, do it again on Wednesday, do it again on Friday and then
*  give yourself a lot of time in between each individual activity to particularly in training
*  for strength. He actually recommends as much as 10 minutes of recovery in between sets,
*  which is kind of crazy.
*  I mean, most people don't have the time for that.
*  You know, six sets is an hour in.
*  I mean, it seems like you're just laying around the gym.
*  People would if you were at the gym, people would mock you.
*  But that's his protocol.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's I think, you know, endurance is like say it's a patient
*  person's game. So I think if you can build that volume in a micro stressing or in a like
*  a sustainable way, that's what's going to keep you or get you strong.
*  And it's also going to make it less likely to get injured.
*  How much time do you need?
*  Like, like if you got, you know, up to that insane pace that you did when you ran the
*  100 miles, when if you took like a week off or two weeks off, how much would you lose?
*  Not much in that amount of time, especially at that intensity.
*  So the thing is, is like the six forty eight mile pace, you we need to be kind of relative
*  about it. So like for me, when I'm out training, when I'm not when I'm not when I'm fully
*  recovered, that's like a pretty reasonable pace from an intensity standpoint.
*  So the interesting thing about ultra marathoning is race pace is sometimes faster than even
*  some of your easiest runs in training. So your training is kind of all what we would
*  call like overspeed training, whereas in most endurance events from like the fifteen hundred
*  up to like the marathon, the majority of your work is going to be sub race pace.
*  And then you're going to have like depending on the program, you know, maybe 20, 30 percent
*  of that be like overspeed training. Why is that?
*  Well, just because the relative duration of the event is so long, like, you know, I can't run
*  fast or if I run too fast, then it's just going to end badly for me.
*  Right. But why is that with marathons? Oh, well, because it becomes it's similar
*  to strength training where like if the limiter is like the amount of like stress you put on your
*  body. So if I was going to train to peak and say a marathon, my my max potential pace for that
*  wouldn't be sustainable to do every run. So I'd be running I'd be running too hard,
*  too fast, too often. And then we'd get into that that kind of situation that we're talking about
*  before, where you're starting a macro stress versus micro stress.
*  So if you run a marathon, what is your standard marathon pace?
*  So I'm a little goofy where I competed in high school and college. And then I did some
*  marathons, but not really in a structured manner. And then I got an ultra marathon running. So I
*  haven't really done what I would consider a real legitimate marathon training program.
*  So you're basically saying marathons are for pussies, right? Is that what you're saying?
*  Just said it. I actually think marathon. I actually think marathons are maybe the hardest
*  event of them all. I'll explain why because you're going fast. Well, yeah, it's just short enough
*  where you have to be pushing like a fairly intense pace. But it's just long enough where if you make
*  a mistake, you're going to pay for that for quite some time. So you're on such a razor's edge. And
*  you're also just one tiny mistake away from things going really badly. What you're saying about
*  mistake, you're talking about pacing. Like if you go out too hard. I see your watch. What kind of
*  watch you're wearing? It's a Coros Apex. Well, I've never heard of that one before. Is that a GPS
*  watch? One of those? Yeah, it's relative. They're a relatively new brand. Like in running, I guess
*  like the two kind of big players historically have been Suunto and Garmin. And Coros kind of came to
*  the market a few years ago. They wanted to try to make like take that high end technology, but
*  make it maybe a little more affordable and also make it user friendly because now everyone's
*  there. They care more about the post workout or the post run data that you're uploading to these
*  platforms like Strava. So like Coros kind of made it a big point to make it real user friendly on
*  that end. So you like I get down at the run and I load it up to the app and it's up on Strava,
*  like within a few seconds sometimes. And then you go dissect all the data, like how much elevation
*  gain and loss, your pace per mile, all that. Is this primarily a running watch? I mean, you could
*  use it for running or cycling or hiking or mountaineering or anything like that. It's got
*  like all those kinds of bells and whistles on it. Okay. So if you're, my question was like, so if
*  you're running, how are you, are you're checking your watch if you're doing a marathon, you're
*  making sure that you're not going crazy? Cause it's, is it otherwise you just have to kind of gauge
*  it just based on the pack and based on how you feel. Yeah. And I think that's actually a good,
*  especially when you get into ultra-marathoning, I think the metric that people should dial in the
*  most is their rate of perceived exertion. Cause that's something that's not gonna necessarily lie
*  to you. Like if you base your thing, your stuff off heart rate exclusively or a pace exclusively,
*  you can find yourself like justifying something that's not necessarily where you need to be.
*  And if something like that malfunctions and that was your like only compass, then you're in trouble.
*  So I like when I'm doing my training and when I'm working with other folks, I like to use heart rate
*  and I like to use pacing and stuff like that. But ultimately I'm trying to get the person to really
*  understand like how hard is this effort and then across the board from like very easy to very
*  difficult. And then when it comes time to race, we can kind of dial in like this is the intensity
*  you're trying to look for so that they can kind of feel that out. Do you use a metric? Like do you
*  say like, how do you feel seven to 10? Yeah, pretty much. I have a scale of like one to 10
*  that I'll use a lot of times. And there's like a whole variety. Like most people are going to be
*  using some sort of like probably like zone system of training where there's like, there's numbers
*  that are associated with heart rate ranges or intensities and there'll be descriptors.
*  And you know, there's some that are like one through 20, there's some that are kind of one
*  through five and then one through 10. And isn't that so, so weird too, right? Because it's so
*  it's subjective in the whoop whoop strap is something I wear and it uses something like that.
*  Like what's your perceived exertion? I'm like, I just push it towards the far right. I don't know.
*  Like what does that mean? Like it's, it's so hard to gauge your perceived exertion,
*  especially when the workouts over. Yeah, it was hard. I went hard. I went all out.
*  Like, what does that mean? I don't know what that means. You know?
*  Yeah. Yeah. It can be tricky and it is very subjective, but I think it's one of those things
*  where it falls into the same category that a lot of endurance events are where you just
*  got to be patient and really work on kind of understanding that. And you learn from experience
*  too. Like you, you find out like, Oh, I went and did this workout and I thought that was the right
*  pace and intensity, but it turned out to be a little too fast. Do you keep a training log?
*  Yeah. And do you like write it on Excel or something like that?
*  I basically just load all my stuff up to Strava and then, uh, yeah. So that's kind of like the
*  go-to for most runners these days is I'm sorry, but do you, do you keep like a diary like today
*  felt like this and this was an issue and I felt like I didn't have enough fluids or do you do
*  anything like that? Not so much anymore. I did it a lot when I was in college and I did it a lot
*  when I first started, when I was really trying to kind of learn my body and kind of learn what
*  things mean and, and, and how I respond to them. But now I've been kind of doing it long enough
*  where I have enough of a, of a, like an understanding of kind of how, like when things go wrong, like
*  why they did, or if something went really well, like why it did that I don't feel like I need to
*  take as detailed notes. But I think it's really valuable for someone who's, especially while
*  they're trying to learn, ready to perceive exertion and kind of really dial those things in. It's,
*  uh, probably worth a lot of, worth a lot, worth their time to write that stuff down so that they
*  can look back at it and they have that resource available to them as they're kind of reflecting
*  on things. Now, say if you're getting ready to do something like this crazy 100 mile run,
*  trying to break a world record, what, what do you, what, how, how much time are you giving yourself
*  to really truly prepare for that? Is it based on what, how you're at right now, like what your
*  baseline is, like what kind of preparation you've done before you knew that this race was available
*  to you? Like how do you do that? Yeah, no, and this is, this is, we can kind of hop back to where
*  we're talking about before. Cause like when I was talking about the VO2 max workout stuff,
*  that's kind of early in my training plan because that intensity is very unspecific to a hundred
*  mile pace. Uh, you know, that's, you know, those VO2 max workouts are much closer to something
*  shorter, like a 5k. So what are you trying to do with those VO2 max workouts? You just trying to
*  elevate your, your base? Yeah, like just like here, like there's the different systems of training
*  and that's kind of a higher intensity system. So it's not very relevant to the race pace that I'm
*  doing specifically, but it's not irrelevant to my overall like, uh, aerobic, uh, efficiency.
*  So like by doing some of those faster stuff, things you can work on things like your form
*  and just because when you're running that fast, like things tend to be a little more dialed in.
*  Uh, and it just, it expand it. Basically what you do is you give yourself kind of a bigger
*  range of what your potential is going to be when you start focusing more in on like the aerobic
*  side of things that we're going to see, like as I would move further down in the training plan.
*  So once I kind of do that section of training, to answer your question though, like ideally I'll
*  have maybe about, since I'm coming into most programs, not completely out of shape,
*  like four months is kind of the sweet spot for me. If I was coming like off the couch,
*  so to speak, six months would be a little more appropriate. Are you ever off the couch?
*  Uh, only if I'm injured and I've only been injured in any significant way since ultra,
*  since they're altering running once for about five weeks. What happened?
*  I had a stress fracture on my right sacral. Uh, what is that?
*  It's kind of, it's basically like on your tailbone. Oh, ouch. Yeah. Yeah. What the
*  fuck happened? So what I think I don't know. It's hard to know for sure, but what was the
*  way it was described to me when I was going in and getting that stuff checked out was what likely
*  happened was I had such a history and kind of flat running that I was actually preparing for
*  a race that had a lot more climbing and descending. So I started changing my training to more climbing
*  and descending. And when I did that, like, uh, one thing that sometimes happens when you're running
*  a lot of flat, hard surfaces is your like ankles and your hips can get pretty tight from that real
*  like kind of uniform, like a mechanic that you're doing. So like my range of motion was
*  semi-limited. So when I was doing some of that hard downhill and uphill running, I just probably
*  wasn't very efficient with my form and it ended up kind of, we're talking about before those impact
*  forces ended up in the wrong spot. And then the stress fracture occurred. That is crazy. You broke
*  your ass. You literally broke your ass. People always talk about, oh, he was busting his ass.
*  Like you actually did. So where is it, Jamie? Right there? Oh, Jesus Christ. It's so it's
*  it literally is your ass bone. You, the really goofy thing about it too was,
*  wow, when I first had the pain surface for that, it was kind of in like the lower back glute area
*  is where it surfaced. So I thought I had like a sciatic issue. Like, oh, makes sense. I went into
*  the doctor and they were like, okay, let's try some like active release therapy and let's see if we
*  can get this thing to loosen up. And we just were working on and working on it. And like it would
*  like clear up where I wouldn't notice it if I was walking around. But then anytime I'd go for a run
*  or try to go for a run, I get that sharp pain right away. And so after about, I think it was
*  maybe four weeks or so we just we had been doing a ton of active release, a ton of mobility work.
*  And then like it wasn't going away. So he's like, well, let's just get an MRI and see what's going
*  on in there. And they did the MRI, got the results back. And he said, there's nothing there. So you
*  start running again. So I started running again. I ran like, I think it was two or three days, maybe
*  very short, like two miles and then three miles, then maybe five or something like that.
*  And then I got a call back from the doctor and he's like, Oh, it turns out we took a second
*  look at the MRI. There is a stress fracture. And I told him like, well, I've just ran the first three
*  pain free days I ever I have since this this issue. Oh, so minefuck. Yeah. Well, and I think what he
*  said maybe was going on there was it was, I mean, it was a very fine stress fracture. It wasn't,
*  I mean, sometimes when people have a fracture on their sacral alla, it's like a big enough fracture
*  where like it can be out for like a year. And oh, yeah, yeah. So it can be a really bad injury.
*  He said maybe the mobility and the strength work I was doing while I had that to try to rehab
*  kind of strengthen the areas around it enough that when I just was running flat, really slow,
*  really easy that protected that area enough where I didn't feel the pain anymore.
*  So after that, I think I took another like two weeks off completely just to make sure before
*  I started building back up. And then I started kind of building back up again.
*  Do you ever run on one of those air runner things, you know, those self propelling treadmills?
*  I've been on one once before, but not in any like significant way. They look pretty sweet.
*  I love those damn things. Which one do we have? What is it? Who makes it? It's air dine, right?
*  Air dine makes it the air runner. Is that what it's called? Jamie will find out. But anyway,
*  man, it's some percentage 13 or make up the number 13% harder than actual air air runner.
*  Yeah. It's amazing. It's hard as fuck. I gave one to Bert, Bert Kreischer.
*  This is too hard. Because he likes using a treadmill and pretending he's really running
*  when he's just picking his legs up and down. You know, but that makes you actually push.
*  And so your calves get blown the fuck up, man. It's, it's hard. It's really good. And it's,
*  what does it say? What does it say? What percentage does it say it's harder than actual running?
*  Like if you were just running at the same pace. Some people are like running is hard enough. Why
*  are we making it harder? Well, the idea is that you go and run and it makes running easier.
*  Sort of like running with weights on, but it doesn't give you an additional stress.
*  Yeah, that's a good point. It's not pounding on your body. You know, it's not like you're doing
*  anything that's going to injure you, but it's, it's cause you, you know, you have to propel that
*  thing. You know, it's for folks who don't know what we're talking about. It's basically a very
*  subtle you, right? Like the way the thing is structured and it's got tread on it. And as you
*  run, you are the thing that's making it move. So there's no machinery. It's not plugged in.
*  It's not like a, it's electronic and you set the pace and you just kind of keep up with it. It's
*  not, it's you're making it run. So you're pushing it. And as you push it, it requires extra energy
*  and extra effort. And that extra effort, when you actually go run on a regular road surface or a
*  trail, it seems easier. Yeah. I know that makes sense. And I think it's pretty cool. Cause like,
*  with the weighted stuff, like you run the risk of potentially hurting something by adding that
*  additional weight. Like they were doing these, uh, rock challenges. I forget the comp. I think it was
*  trained to hunt or one of these, one of these competitions, they were making people wear heavy
*  packs. It might not have been trained to hunt. It was, I think it was another con anyway, they would
*  make you wear like a hundred pound pack. And so the idea was they were doing these races with a
*  hundred pound packs on, which you can imagine is a recipe for orthopedic surgeon visits. And so
*  these people were getting kind of jacked up and they, they, I believe they stopped doing that
*  as a competition, you know, as a running competition, but there's a few of those
*  similar kind of competitions where they force you to do a bunch of physical activities
*  and then bring your heart rate down and execute shots on targets and then run to the next station
*  and do a bunch of physical activities. And they were doing that with heavy, heavy weights on,
*  it just really was a bad idea. Yeah. Yeah. I think that would, that would be maybe good for,
*  if you're going to do like a mountaineering experience and you're going to have to carry a
*  bunch of little stuff like you're doing with hunting. But even then you really should just
*  rock. You just put the heavy pack on. There's a company called outdoorsman's that makes a really
*  good one. It's called an Atlas pack and it's essentially a pack frame, but the back of it is
*  a universal post. Like would you would use for weights, you know, like a weightlifting post
*  for, you know, Olympic weights, you know, so those big round steel plates slide right onto it. So
*  you can get a 45 pound plate on it and then clamp it down. And so it's like really secure on you as
*  opposed to like, sometimes if you put too much weight in a pack, like maybe it'll sit all at the
*  bottom. It's this is like, boom, right in the center of your back and you cramp it down. And,
*  and then, you know, you're really carrying all that weight, you know, on your hips,
*  a little bit on your shoulders and it's all like really centered well. And that's a good one for
*  really training, but you don't fucking run with it. It's just high. Yeah. It's hard enough. Yeah.
*  Hard enough just to walk with it. Does it say how much, what the extra percentage is?
*  It's no, I couldn't find like an official testing of whatever, but one person that did a big deep
*  dive into it said it's a main thing was to, it fixes gate or it will improve running gate.
*  That 30% is a number that they read as like a sales like thing. 30%. I didn't hear that one.
*  I thought it was 13. I couldn't find it was like a, I'm trying to find like testing or some sort of
*  science on it. It doesn't seem like it's 30%. Man, I don't know. What the fuck do I know? What am I,
*  a mathematician? But it's, it's just excellent for training. Do you do any training on machines
*  or is all your training essentially done on the road? The running is all pretty much done on the
*  road and the trails. I'll do like some mobility work and some strength work in the gym.
*  And that's where I'll, I'll kind of go inside, I guess, for it. But yeah, you know, I've,
*  I've used treadmills and stuff in the past and I do use them from time to time, but
*  usually if I have the option to go outside, I'll do that. And I mean, I live in Phoenix, so
*  it's, you know, we're, it's sunny. Cold day is 70. Yeah, exactly. I'm there this weekend, actually.
*  Oh yeah, that's right. You're at the, is it Camerica? Camerica. Nice. Yeah. Friday and Saturday.
*  I'm psyched. Yeah. I love Phoenix. Yeah. It's the time of year to be there for sure. Yeah, man. Right.
*  What's the temperature there right now? Probably maybe 65 or so.
*  I've been there before in the summer in July when he's doing Tempe improv and it was like fucking
*  120. Well, and that's, that's the funny thing too. Cause when I was training for that a hundred
*  mile, 12 hour world record, it was through the summer. Cause the race was in August. So my peak
*  training was like 110 degrees some days. And the funny thing too is the Pettit center where I did
*  the race, it was actually built for speed skating and some hockey rinks. So they keep it at like 60
*  degrees. And I remember one day when I was running, it was like one of the hottest days
*  of the summer. I'm thinking like, I'm going to race literally at half this temperature. Yeah.
*  So it's really funny when you, when you see, when you see that. And I think I'm, I'm no expert at
*  it by any means, but I think there's some pretty cool like studies and stuff that of the effects
*  that happen when you are training in some of those extreme heats, like what happens it for the way
*  it was described to me is it kind of simulates training at altitude to a degree. So who knows,
*  maybe that makes sense. Well, it's similar to hot yoga, right? That's they're doing some studies
*  at Harvard. I believe I think it's Harvard. Someone was explaining the whole deal to me.
*  This is not something that I read, but essentially what they're doing is they're trying to
*  find out whether or not hot yoga, these 90 minute hot yoga sessions replicate some of the known
*  benefits of sauna because you know, obviously the temperature is not as hot. They keep it the hot
*  yoga place I go to. I think they keep it at 105 degrees versus sauna, you know, gets much, much
*  hotter than that. You're in like the one 80s, which is what I like. And, but the idea is that
*  when your body is extremely stressed, when you're doing these poses and you're sweating like crazy,
*  that your body core temperature rises basically to a similar level than if you were just sitting
*  in a sauna. So you get a very similar response. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's really interesting. So I,
*  I try to remember that when it's the summer in Phoenix, so I don't get too miserable.
*  You bumped out by, yeah, it's got, you gotta be doing yourself good. Um, Kronk gym, which is
*  one of the most famous boxing gyms in history, Emmanuel Stewart, who was a, just a wizard of
*  boxing and he trained Tommy Hearns and, you know, some of the, the, like the all time greats of that
*  era, he would crank the temperature and this is in Detroit, they would crank the temperature up
*  so you would go into that gym and it would be that way, like for that specific reason,
*  cause he believed that it increased endurance. Yeah. It's, it's, it's interesting stuff,
*  but I'll still take January and February for comfort. Now, what do you do in terms of like,
*  how do you hydrate yourself and like, what, what kind of durations are we talking about? Like say,
*  if you're, if it's 110 degrees outside 120, what was the hottest you ran at? I think 110 is what
*  I got up to. And I try to get out relatively early so that it's not like 110 from start to finish.
*  So like if I get out, say at like six or seven in the morning, you know, it might be in the 80s,
*  high 80s and be working its way up so that like I'm finishing and it might be 110 for my key
*  workouts. The way I structure my training usually when I'm kind of in peak is I'll do the, my biggest
*  workout in the morning and then I might go out and do like a second run. That's like a little shorter
*  or quite a bit shorter in most cases and really low intensity. And you know, then sometimes if
*  it's the afternoon in Phoenix, that's when I would see like that 110, but I'm usually not out for
*  more than like 45, 60 minutes for those. So hydrating is, is interesting because you know,
*  I grew up in the Midwest, so I was very familiar with running in hot, humid stuff in the summer.
*  And you know, the dry desert heat though, it seems like you get thirsty a lot quicker and a lot more
*  frequently. So I, you know, one of the things I learned the first summer I was in Phoenix was
*  knowing where the water fountains are and kind of planning our routes around that.
*  You drink out of public water fountains?
*  When I have to.
*  Do you worry about cooties?
*  I haven't gotten anything too miserable yet. In fact, I did a race earlier this year, I think it
*  was in early June called the San Diego hundred. And it's got this spot in the middle of the course
*  where the aid stations are a little further apart. There's like a nine mile stretch and a seven mile
*  stretch. And I kind of mistimed how much water I did. So I filled up my water in a stream and it
*  was probably not an ideal spot. But I rolled the dice and it didn't get, no, I didn't get anything
*  bad. No, my thought during the race was that this is the mindset in the middle of one of these things
*  is like, well, if something really bad happens, it'll happen after the race. So I'll definitely
*  would, but it's really bad. Jardina is rough. I've never had it, but the people that I know
*  that have had it say it's really bad. But you know, you could just bring a Steri pen.
*  Yeah.
*  But you can't really stop, huh?
*  Yeah. I mean, in a race, I wouldn't want to. And what really helped for me was the situation
*  is since the track, since the race was on an indoor track, 400 and like, I think 42 and some
*  odd meters, I was doing a lot of my big long runs on a 400 meter track. So when I did that,
*  I would just bring out like a cooler and I'd have ice and water in there.
*  Just have it sit there waiting for you. Oh, that's sweet. Yeah, that makes sense. But when you do a
*  lot of trail running though, right? I do some of that too. Yeah. Historically I've done a lot more
*  flat runnable stuff, but now that I'm out in Phoenix, I like to try to split the year into
*  two halves and do some trail stuff in half the year and some like flatter road or track or
*  runnable stuff in the second half of the year. Do you bring water when you run trails? Do you
*  bring like a backpack or something like that? Like one of those, um, you know, what are those things?
*  Like a pack.
*  Yeah. Yeah. With the tubes. What the fuck is that? Camels, camel, camel backs.
*  Yeah, there's I'll do, I don't usually use what they call like the bladder, which is the tube thing
*  that you're talking about. They are, and you can pack a lot of water. Um, usually unless I,
*  unless I'm going to be away from a potential stop long enough, usually what I'll do is I'll,
*  I'll use the pack, but I'll have like smaller little like, like little flask soft lacks in there.
*  Okay. So you bring those to that, like on the chest traps. A lot of people when they run with
*  those, but you're rolling the dice with that. Like you got to know how much to sip. Yeah.
*  You don't want to get greedy.
*  The pickup spots are for more run with friends.
*  Yeah. Um, when I run with my dog in the summer, when it gets really hot, I bring a hydro flask
*  in a backpack and I'm one of those collapsible dog bowls because you know, I don't want him
*  drinking out of puddles and shit. And so, but that just having that extra couple pounds on your back,
*  it makes a difference. You feel it.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's why part of the reason why I try to go as minimal as I can with
*  water. If I, if I can get away with it, obviously if I go out and do like a big loop where there's
*  no potential stops, I'm going to have to carry it all from the beginning. But, uh, if it's a spot
*  where I know like I can get to water every five, six, seven miles, then usually I'll,
*  I'll pack a little lighter and not be carrying as much at any one given time.
*  Do you hydrate up before you go?
*  Yeah. I mean, I think that's the one, one of the hardest things to really get right in Phoenix was
*  just like kind of learning kind of how much you need to be hydrating like between sessions.
*  Cause what I usually found out is I could go out and kind of neglect hydration for any one given
*  like run or workout. But if I did that, then the next one, I would probably pay for it.
*  So for me, the big motivation to make sure I'm on top of hydration during any given run is cause
*  I know like if I don't, then the next one is going to potentially be miserable.
*  Yeah, man. I've done that before. That's, that's a weird feeling trying to do anything when you're
*  dehydrated. It's like you have a bad battery or something. It's like, everything's like, oh,
*  come on. It's, it's, it's amazing how just normal everyday life, like you could feel like a little
*  rundown and you barely notice it. But once you start physically exerting, once you start training,
*  once you start doing something hard, that's when you become like really in tune with how you're
*  screwing your body up. Like drinking for instance, like have a couple of drinks and then run like,
*  oh God, you're like, well, this is what it's doing to my body. I gotta fucking stop drinking,
*  you know? Yeah. Yeah. I think you, you, I like drinking to thirst. That's usually what my gauge
*  is. And I haven't really had any issues with it's with that, with that. So there's no like strategy,
*  like say I'm going to run 25 miles today. Let me drink X amount of liters of water before I go out.
*  No, before the run. Yeah. No, I try not to like do too much like kind of like preemptive hydrating.
*  Because I think what you want, what people oftentimes I think do then is they drink
*  too much. And then that comes at the expense of your electrolytes too,
*  because your body is going to excrete those. So if I'm, if I find myself,
*  couldn't you just supplement? You can. Yeah. And I'll, I'll do a lot more of that,
*  especially in the heat too, just in general is like having a like electrolyte supplementation
*  and things like that. What do you use for your electrolyte supplementation?
*  I use a product called Hydro X mostly it's a, like a powder that you can kind of mix in with your
*  water by a company named X endurance. They have, they make these little tubes now too, where like,
*  so if I'm running and I have like one bottle with some in it already, I can have these little like
*  these little tubes that if I've refilled and want to put more and I can just kind of take them out,
*  pop it off and pour that in. A lot of other people will use, you can make like little caps that
*  you just like swallow it with your water and it's got like the formulation of the different
*  electrolytes in there kind of dialed in. And you know, that's, I think that's a little more
*  hit or miss as to like, like where people feel you need that. Some people tell you don't really
*  need electrolytes at all. You just need to salt your foods and things like that all the way to
*  like, you should be taking X number of these every hour. There's gotta be science behind it,
*  right? I mean, do you, are you taking, getting blood tests and finding out what your levels are
*  pre and post workouts or anything along those lines? Yeah. I haven't done any like post workout
*  tests to say other than, I know I was part of the faster study, which was a study that looked at
*  high carbon, high fat athletes. And I think they were looking at some of that stuff too. And like
*  anytime I've ever had a blood test done though, by like my, my electrolytes, like my sodium
*  potassium levels always been in range. So I haven't really tried to, it's one of those things then
*  where it's like, I'm probably not going to try to fix something that's not broken. Right. And you're
*  pretty diligent about your supplementation things. Yeah. And I mean, I, I, I definitely am not afraid
*  to salt my food. You know, most of my food is conducive to putting salt on. So, you know,
*  I'm probably getting quite a bit of that stuff just in my day to day nutrition too.
*  Do you have specific salt that you like? Do you use Himalayan? Do you use sea salt? Like what do
*  you, what do you like to use? Yeah, I like to get sea salt. Lately I've been using this stuff called
*  Redmond sea salt. They get their salt out of like, I believe it's in Utah and Salt Lake. Oh, okay.
*  And I don't know like if the, how accurate or whatever this is, but like I heard that if you
*  can get an inland sea salt, it's better because it's not like, uh, it doesn't have potential,
*  as many potential toxins that you're going to find in like ocean sea salt. Yeah. Yeah. That's what the
*  idea about Himalayan sea salt is, right? Because it's no real fucking sea in the Himalayas. Right.
*  Is it called Himalayan sea salt or am I just making that up or is it Himalayan salt?
*  I think it's sea salt, right? Yeah. The pink Himalayan sea salt. Right. Yeah. But how was it
*  sea salt? Explain that. How does that work? Was it an older sea? I wonder if that's what it is.
*  And it's, it's just like these big salt. Oh, it is just salt. Okay. Oh, it's just Himalayan salt.
*  No. It both comes up. Oh yeah. I think I've heard it. Like an old sea that's no longer there and
*  they just have the big salt deposits. Right. Like that's what a lot of Montana is the great
*  western inland sea, you know, like millions of years ago, like they find seashells in Montana.
*  Yeah. So it's just fucking bonkers. Yeah. It's crazy. I was, I was in Utah earlier in the year.
*  I can't remember where we were just out of Salt Lake and apparently that used to be on
*  underwater too. And like, they'll find like shark teeth and stuff like that around there. Like,
*  and it's, you're up on this like trail and they're like, there's no water in sight.
*  Think about that next time you see some asshole that spent $10 million on a house on the beach.
*  What makes you think that's going to stay there, man? Pay for that eventually. Yeah. That is not
*  going to be here. Something's going to be different in the future. It's always been that way. Like
*  there's no permanent like place where the water is or the water isn't. Yeah. It is funny how we
*  think of that though, where it's like, we see the map now and we're like, oh, okay, this is just how
*  it is. And so maybe not. Well, look at Pangea, you know, things change pretty goddamn radically.
*  What's up, Jamie? I don't know the accuracy of this, but I just found this. Okay. Himalayan sea
*  salt is a gourmet salt with a slightly misleading name. It doesn't come from the Himalayan mountains.
*  Oh Jesus. And it doesn't come from a sea. These motherfuckers. However, it's definitely a sea salt.
*  So it's not a total misnomer. Himalayan salt actually refers to exclusively to Pakistani rock
*  salt. Hmm. That used to be sea salt hundreds of millions of years ago. So why don't we call it
*  Pakistan? If I was Pakistani, I'd be pissed. Yeah. Like these motherfuckers are stealing our shine.
*  When a sea spreading over the region dried up, it was covered by geological shifts leading massive
*  deposits of salt scattered throughout the hills. Odd name aside, Himalayan salt has a lot going for
*  it. It's tasty. It's pink. And some even claim it as healing, well, those fucking healing properties,
*  assholes. Those are the people that like crystals. Yeah. That's what that is. We have a big Himalayan
*  salt rock right there. Yeah. Feeling low. I'll just go lick that sucker. Has anybody looked at
*  that yet? Someone must have licked it when we were looking. Yeah, I like Himalayan salt though.
*  It's nice. But like for cooking meat in particular, I like kosher salt because it's got the big
*  flakes. The flakes. Yeah. When you put the big flakes on there, does that help retain the moisture
*  on it? Allegedly. I don't know. I cook in a Traeger, which I find that the low heat and
*  the... What I do is I cook at about 225 degrees and they have a setting called super smoke.
*  Accentuates the smoke. You know what a Traeger is, right? Yeah. For folks who don't know,
*  it's a pellet grill. And what pellet grills are, they use something like this table.
*  Like when they make this table, this is hardwood, this is made out of oak. They would saw the tree
*  and the sawdust in the past, they would just sort of throw out. Well, then they figured out
*  where you can compress that sawdust and turn it into these pellets using the natural sugars
*  from the wood. So there's no chemicals at all. And there's a lot of really good ones, but the
*  one that I use is a Traeger. And when they compress these pellets, there's a heating element that's
*  electrically fired inside the grill. That heating element turns into flame. It cooks the pellets
*  and turns it into fire. So it's just fire and wood. It's really pure. So you're just basically
*  cooking over wood and it's, you can perfectly regulate the temperature and you do it on your
*  app and all that stuff. But because it's so well insulated and I cook most of what I cook is wild
*  game, which is very low in fat. So you really can't, you really shouldn't cook at high heat
*  or for any long period of time. You got to, you got to make sure you monitor the temperature of
*  the actual food itself. So I like to put it in there and I get it up to about 125, 130 degrees.
*  Then I sear it on a cast iron frying pan, usually in beef tallow, beef tallow is what I like the
*  best for that. So I get some more extra fats, healthy fats with that. I've been doing a lot
*  of slow cooking lately. I'll go in phases where I'll be grilling. I got to get a pellet grill though.
*  Those things look pretty sweet. I'll hook you up. I'll have Traeger send you one. Oh, awesome. That'd
*  be great. Dude, they're the best Traeger. Once you use one, it's like, I have a regular grill. It's
*  just fucking gathering dust. I don't even touch it anymore because it's, you could do everything
*  on this thing and it's so easy to maintain the exact perfect temperature. And again, for game,
*  like I'm not cooking at a high heat. I'm not worried as much about losing moisture or stuff
*  like that. It's mostly a flavor thing. I really just love the flavor of like the salty on the
*  outside and then especially when it's seared, you know, it's just nice. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I,
*  I think like the low and slow is the way to go for a lot of that stuff. And yeah, when I do a,
*  when I roast, I'll get like a roast and I'll put it in a slow cooker and ultimately some of the fat
*  will separate and kind of form on the top and always take that off and use it, cook eggs and
*  stuff later. So it's, Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Well, a lot of people have their own idea about
*  what to do and what not to do, but I, I learned this from a guy named Chad Ward, his label on
*  Instagram is whiskey bent barbecue. Oh yeah. And he's a world champion pit master. This fucking guy
*  can cook his ass off. Oh my God. He's cooked for us a few times in, in hunting camps and his food
*  is insane. He's so good. And that's his philosophy is the reverse sear method is what I learned it
*  from. I learned it from him. A lot of times people will cook it, they sear it on the outside and then
*  they try to finish it off and you can do that that way, but it's not as good. It's better to
*  bring it up to temperature slowly inside like a pellet grill. Another good method is sous vide.
*  Do you ever sous vide things? I haven't yet. I've had it from restaurants before though.
*  Like, yeah, I was talking to someone, they said a lot of restaurants now do that just so they can
*  kind of make their, all their stuff more uniform. So you go and you get exactly what you did the
*  last time. Yeah, they don't, no one fucks up. Cause if you go, you know, you can go to a restaurant,
*  order medium rare and it comes out well done. You get mad. I've had that happen. Right. But the
*  sous vide method is fantastic too, because say if you have a steak and you want that steak to be
*  135 degrees, you basically put the setting at 135 degrees and you can put it in there for four hours.
*  So when you get it, it's just all the tendons and ligaments and all that stuff is just broken down.
*  All the fascia is broken down and it's just so tender, but it feels weird cause you're boiling
*  it in a fucking plastic bag. It seems so wrong. It's like you're not, I mean, I know it's a
*  different kind of plastic, but you're not even supposed to drink water. If your plastic bottle
*  has been sitting in a hot car. It's like, how the fuck can you, apparently you can. It's not an issue
*  at all, you know, to cook in it, but it makes me feel weird. Eventually we'll hear in five years
*  that that's going to give us cancer. I don't know, man. I don't think so. I mean, what is the reason
*  why they can, okay, here we're going down a rabbit hole. Let's try it. Let's go down the sous vide
*  rabbit hole. Why is it okay to sous vide your food and why doesn't it leak? What is it? BCPs? Is
*  that what they're worried about? BPAs, BCAs, BCAs, BPAs, BPAs, which is a bunch of B and a bunch of
*  other letters, which is supposed to be what you get. There's probably some NASA scientists who
*  figured it out though, right? Maybe not, man. Maybe the same guy who said smoking's fine.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, remember the doctors prefer camel. Remember those ads?
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, I don't think we're dealing with that, but it just, it feels weird. But it for,
*  as far as flavor, it's a phenomenal way to cook. And particularly wild game. It's really good for
*  because again, you don't overcook it. Like if you want to cook an elk steak to 130 degrees and then
*  blow torch the outside, that's what a lot of people do. You know, that's how you finish on a sous vide.
*  You basically use a fucking blow torch. So I have this, I guess it's like the Elon Musk
*  flamethrower in the background. I literally could use that because it's basically the same thing.
*  It's just a fucking torch and you torch the outside of it to get a nice, you know, caramelized crust.
*  And then the inside, you know, it's perfectly cooked. Yeah. What does it say, Jamie?
*  I don't like this one.
*  You don't like it? Does it say it's going to kill you?
*  The first one just says like there's after a considerable amount of research that's been done.
*  We believe the answer is it's safe. And it's like they believe it is.
*  Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
*  It's like a little window.
*  Well, I feel like if you don't cook in it every day, like when the director of the Cove was in
*  here, I always fucking have a hard time saying his last. So Hoyas, so Hoyas, Louis Hoyas was in here.
*  He was explaining how he was eating a lot of fish before he became a vegan. He was eating a ton of
*  fish and his mercury levels really shot up because a lot of fish, that's like a lot of fucking mercury.
*  And if you eat fish for morning, noon and night, every day, day after day after day,
*  you can develop high mercury levels. But then I talked to other scientists. They said, yes,
*  if you're eating it every day, all day, but if you just eat it fish, like once a week, you're fine.
*  Like, don't worry about it. Or even twice a week. So I was like, oh,
*  did they say anything? Because I remember like when I think it was probably when the
*  Mediterranean diet got popular, people were all in on salmon and stuff and seafood. And
*  then everyone went wild caught. And I guess that's where you'd get the mercury.
*  But then they would say like the farm raised salmon are not as good for you for whatever reason.
*  But then I guess now farm raises what you're supposed to get because that's going to control
*  that environment. I heard what Louis was saying was that it's even worse. Oh, really? Yeah. In
*  terms of like the heavy metals and talk, you got to think they're just sitting there. You know,
*  like at least in the ocean, they're migrating, they're moving around, they're swimming in
*  different places. Like that podcast that I did with him was so disturbing because I've always
*  had this weird, not weird, just this sort of peripheral fear of what we're doing to the ocean.
*  This like thing like, man, how many assholes are out there? Just giant nets, just pulling fish out
*  of the ocean right now as we speak. And how much is that sustainable? I mean, I think individual
*  people fishing is sustainable, but that's not what's going on. It's just huge nets. They're
*  just scooping up everything. And the conversation that I had with him scared the shit out of me
*  for the future of the ocean because what's been done, the amount of damage that's been done over
*  a hundred years, it's very similar to the amount of damage that was done sort of at the end of the
*  18th century, the beginning of the 19th century in the United States where market hunters
*  basically wiped out almost every animal, wiped out the buffalo. Do you know when they were
*  shooting the buffalo, they were basically shooting them for their hides and their tongues,
*  and they would leave the carcasses to rot, which is just insane. When you think about bison today,
*  it's like one of the most cherished meats because it's so delicious and so good for it and high in
*  protein and tastes great. But we basically almost wiped out every animal on this
*  entire continent until they stepped in and decided to start regulating hunting and stopping it and
*  then sort of made concerted efforts to reintroduce animals. And still most of them are not at their
*  historic range. Yeah. Yeah, no, it gets interesting when you start looking into some of that stuff,
*  but hopefully they get the bison herd back to where they need to.
*  Well, they kind of have that. I mean, there's basically a healthy supply of bison, but not the
*  ocean. The thing is like the same thing that we did, not we, you and I weren't alive, but the
*  human beings did in North America, they're doing right now, the world is doing to the ocean. And
*  there's no real concerted effort to reintroduce these animals or fish. Sure. I see what you're
*  saying. Yeah. So we're essentially not learning from our past mistakes. Well, yeah, we're just,
*  and it's also, there's too many people involved. The thing about the ocean is it's kind of
*  unregulated, right? Yeah. Cause we did it. It's the wild west out there. It's just this big,
*  gigantic swath of, it's basically like another world that's connected to our world.
*  You know, it's a water world. We have the land world and the land monsters go into the water
*  world with these floating little fucking killing machines and suck all the living forces and living
*  beings out of the water world and then serve it up on rice. Sushi, ah, I'm eating healthy.
*  But it's just, it's weird. Are you still doing, you were doing a podcast with Dr. Sean Baker,
*  right? Yeah. Yeah. It's a human performance outliers podcast. We've been, I think we've got
*  maybe 175 episodes now. So we've been going- Oh, so you guys are still haul at it. Yeah. Yeah. We're
*  not, we, we had a stretch where we're doing about three a week, but we've kind of backed off a
*  little bit of that where just scheduling and stuff gets- How do you do it? Do you do it over
*  the phone? Yeah. That's always the hardest part. Where's he? He's, he's down in Southern California.
*  Okay. And then you're in Phoenix, Arizona. And so do you have guests and do that over the phone?
*  Yeah, we'll bring them in and we'll record with like zoom video recording and then bring it up.
*  But that's always the hardest part is getting the audio quality for that. It's awkward too, right?
*  Yeah. I really, I've only done over the last few years, I did the Snowden interview, which I did
*  remotely. And I did one with Dr. Anthony West, who's an Egyptologist with him. But most, most of the
*  time when you do it with the Skype or anything along those lines, it's like you're kind of talking
*  over each other. There's this weird delay. It feels inorganic. Yeah. In person is the way to go.
*  Yeah. If you can do it. So props to you for- I just, I just don't, I mean, I just don't, I don't
*  like it. It feels, I feel, I don't feel connected, right? It feels awkward. Yeah.
*  It doesn't, doesn't make a good product. I don't think as good a product.
*  No, for sure. Yeah. You're taking a step back if you do remote for sure. So yeah, but it's been,
*  it's been a cool experience just from a learning standpoint. I mean, we,
*  I don't think we really have a specific direction. I mean, Sean's, Sean's kind of the guy that
*  everyone looks to from the carnivore thing. So I think sometimes we get identified as carnivore,
*  but we definitely go down a bunch of different rabbit holes. Like we did, we've had a lot of,
*  like some of the protein researchers come on and talk about some of that stuff. Like Dr. Stu Phillips
*  or Professor Stu Phillips, Professor Don Lehman, Professor Jose Antonio. What do you mean by protein
*  stuff? Like different qualities of protein? Yeah. They're doing like the protein research. They're
*  kind of the guys who are on the, doing some of the more recent research and looking at like, well,
*  what are our protein needs for across like a variety of ages, as well as when you introduce
*  athletics and then like, what is the quality versus, or like, I guess maybe the best way to
*  look at it is like the bioavailability of different protein sources and things like that. And I think
*  there's a, it seems like something that we've figured out already, but there's, I guess some
*  nuance with that even. And now we're there, they're saying that there's, there's probably
*  reason to believe that our, our recommendations should be higher than what they have been
*  historically, especially for athletes and elderly folks. And you mean the RDA? Yeah. Yeah. The RDA,
*  as it currently stands, is basically just to prevent disease, right? Yeah. Something like that. And
*  I think they're, I think they maybe are learning more too about just kind of what role protein
*  plays in bone health too, as opposed to just, cause people think of protein as just this building
*  block for muscle, but there's a lot that goes into it with, with bone, bone health as well. So
*  those guys that were really interesting to hear, hear about, and you know, we've done a lot of
*  stuff with ranchers and some of the, like the savory Salatin folks come on the show and talk
*  about kind of that practice versus kind of your standard agricultural production methods and things
*  like that. You mean Joel Salatin? What is savory? What do you mean? Oh, like Alan Savory. So we've
*  had Alan Savory, Joel Salatin, Will Harris from White Oak Pastures on, Bobby Gill, he's part of
*  the Savory Institute. Come on and just kind of share with us like kind of where that stuff is at,
*  cause I think there's a lot of guesswork and unanswerable questions at this point with,
*  with some of that stuff. Cause we're projecting like, you know, way down the road with some of
*  this stuff. Are you talking about the difference between grain fed versus grass fed meat? Yeah.
*  And most specifically with those guys too, just like kind of what it's doing to the soil health
*  and the soil quality. So one thing that I've learned that was interesting was that, I mean,
*  we kind of start to like throw a lot of these different like quote unquote regenerative type
*  practices into one like bucket or one category when in reality there's a lot of different
*  variants within them. So someone can say like, Oh, regenerative agriculture is going to save the
*  planet. And then someone will go dig up a bunch of studies that show like, well, no, it actually
*  doesn't do anything. And then like, yeah, I'm confused in that because Chris Kresser is all in
*  on this regenerative agricultural thing, but is there, is there real evidence that you can have a
*  zero carbon gain? Yeah. I mean, it's a, cause that's the, that's the, the, the net positive.
*  The idea is that if you use regenerative agriculture, meaning the animals graze there,
*  there's, you're not talking about monocrop environments that these cows graze on open
*  fields of grass and then they shit all over the place. And then, you know, that, that shit becomes
*  manure and that this actually helps the plant life grow and all this stuff sort of,
*  it all becomes a part of a cycle. And that this regenerative practice is actually, instead of
*  raising the carbon footprint, it actually makes a carbon neutral footprint. Yeah. Yeah. And I think
*  where sometimes it gets confusing is if you go and you just look at studies on regenerative
*  agriculture, you get a lot of mixed information. So what I was told, and I'm still kind of going
*  down this rabbit hole and the way I like to look at all these types of things is I try to like,
*  look at one side of the story and then look to the other side and see where the counters are to that
*  and just kind of go back and forth until you hit a dead end. And then, you know, if you hit a dead
*  end, like that's where you're at for now, until you've something else gets introduced. And where
*  I got to now is, I think it was maybe Will Harris told us this, that when you're looking for these
*  studies on kind of what practice is going to be good in terms of like soil regeneration, you have
*  to look up adaptive multipatic grazing. Because if you look up like holistic or regenerative
*  agriculture, you're going to see, to get a whole mess of like different ranges or different types
*  of it. And some are effective, some aren't. So it's really hard to kind of piece out, you know,
*  who's got the accurate stuff and not. And I mean, I think ultimately some of this stuff is that we
*  just don't know yet. And what was the one that's most, what did you just say? Adaptive multipatic
*  grazing. And what does that mean? It just means like you're instead of kind of your, your, it's
*  a rotational grazing from what I understand, but you're kind of moving the herd along to these
*  different paddocks. And then they're like, you know, they're doing their thing in a, what would
*  you consider like a natural way, like it would have been before we came in and shot all the buffalo
*  and all that stuff. And then they're rotating it. So the way I've been under, I've understood it,
*  like the more of those paddocks you can get, the better, because then you're letting the soil and
*  the, and everything in there like really heal and, and develop that deep root system,
*  as well as some of that microbiome, like all the insects and things that would be in there
*  and all that stuff. So you would need massive amounts of land and massive amounts of areas for
*  them to graze. I think, yeah, I mean, I think you would need, I think the more, the better
*  is probably the way to look at it, but hopefully the soil biologists aren't cringing. They must
*  be cringing. I'm sure they are. And we apologize in advance. But like-
*  The interesting thing though is like, I mean, I think there's a lot of work to be done in looking
*  into this and finding out the best way to maybe utilize it. But the thought, the part that I
*  thought was really interesting is with the Will Harris, White Oak Pastures thing, they just,
*  I think this study is maybe overutilized by, by like the, the pro regenerative or multi-paddock
*  group to a degree, because it's like, it's what they have.
*  And it's what they're looking for. They're looking for a specific answer, meaning this is good.
*  This is the way we found a way where you can eat meat and not feel bad.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And it's, the thing that's compelling about that study to me is the way it kind of
*  happened was essentially what happened was Will Harris and White Oak Pastures, they were, they
*  were raising, raising animals for, for Epic Bar. Like that, that was one of their buyers. And Epic
*  Bar got acquired by, I think it was General Mills. And so General Mills looked at what Epic Bar
*  was claiming when they were the independent and they were saying like, our stuff is regenerative.
*  Ours, you know, you eat, you buy our product and you're giving back versus taking kind of a mindset.
*  And I think General Mills was skeptical about that. So they spent, I think it was like $80,000 to go
*  in and have a study done on, on Will Harris' White Oak's pasture to really see if they could back that
*  claim up. And they went in and they did the study and it actually showed like a net carbon
*  sequestration versus like, they weren't even neutral. They actually pulled in more than they
*  put out. So this is from Epic's particular type of farming that they, that you-
*  Well, at least that White Oak's pasture. So, I mean, again, that's one specific situation or one
*  specific environment or area. So I think where people run into maybe a potential problem is,
*  can we extrapolate that forward to other areas? Are we going to get that same result or is it
*  going to be different? Right. That's what's important to, I mean, and it really is important
*  to look at that honestly, because even though you do have this one area, is that because of the
*  environment where this farm is taking place? Is it because of the particular soil quality? Like,
*  what are the factors that allow them to have, so it's, it actually takes carbon out of the atmosphere,
*  like a certain percentage. So instead of adding carbon, it actually removes some.
*  Kyle Soria Yeah, because I guess the way it was described to me is that the inputs of that type
*  of system are so low that like you're not, like, because if you look at just a normal, like,
*  agricultural setup, you know, you have all these inputs of like manure and all these other things
*  that are going to add to that, that net effect or that negative effect of animal agriculture.
*  So when you reduce the inputs down to next to nothing, because your inputs are all kind of just
*  manpower, where you're moving these things around and letting the natural course of things happen
*  over time. That's where you can maybe minimize some of these, like, I guess what you maybe call
*  it, like a tertiary damage of animal agriculture. But, you know, I think, I think we probably have
*  a lot to learn and stuff with that stuff, too. But it's, it's one of those things when I think
*  about it, it's like, it, hopefully, we're spending a lot of time looking at that stuff, because
*  if they're right about the number of harvests we have left, I think what do they estimate? We have
*  about 60 harvests left. I mean, clearly, regardless of whether you're vegan, carnivore, or somewhere in
*  between, you know, we need quality soil, right? Right. What about hydroponic? Because I know that
*  there are some large scale hydroponic operations that are growing vegetables and things on those
*  lines. And some people think that there's a real promise in that because you're not, you're not
*  using soil at all. You're not using, you're not devastating the already depleted ground soil. And
*  you also don't need to do all the, the harmful things that are involved in monocrop agriculture,
*  right? Like the, the devastation on the wildlife, the displacement of wildlife, pesticides,
*  combines that are indiscriminately, indiscriminately chewing up small rodents and bugs
*  and rabbits and anything else that gets caught in their blades. Yeah, yeah. You know, that'd be
*  interesting. I don't know a whole lot about it other than what it is. So, I mean, I'm all for
*  solutions. Yeah, somebody sent me a link to something that, some indication that there,
*  there might be some promise in hydroponic agriculture. But, so, but the thing about
*  this whole idea was the name of the farm where that this was done, where there's the white oak
*  pastures. Is that sustainable like nationally? Forget about globally, but even nationally in
*  terms of like the, the needs that people have for, for beef? I mean, we, we use so much beef in this
*  country. Yeah, I don't know for sure like what the scalability of that would be. My guess is like
*  at this point it would be, because it's pretty small, like even from a percentage standpoint of
*  what is being, or how much of that type of a process is being used. It's like a single percentage
*  or something like that. So, all grass fed meat, right? All grass fed meat is like less than 3%.
*  Yeah. So, it seems like we'd have a long ways to go. But I mean, I guess the, the counter to that
*  would also be we're essentially going back to what we would have been doing historically. And so,
*  it's not necessarily like reinventing the wheel as much as it is just saying, okay, what we did
*  here obviously is not sustainable or potentially not sustainable. So, let's look at, well, what,
*  what did we do to get back to where we were before? I guess maybe is the way to look at that. But,
*  How did you get linked up with Sean? Because Sean is such a polarizing figure.
*  Yeah.
*  Because he's the carnivore go-to guy and he's like a full on carnivore zealot as it were.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he doesn't even, he thinks vegetables are bad for him.
*  So, I think Sean sometimes gets misrepresented and part of it is just like, you know,
*  way he interacts on social media and stuff. But he's, I met Sean like before he, I think,
*  went full carnivore, but on Twitter. I mean, I thought he was an interesting person, not because
*  of what he ate so much.
*  What was he doing back then? What was he eating?
*  He was kind of more like high fat, low carb, I think. Something pretty similar to what I'm doing.
*  Maybe less carbohydrates since his activity levels are like really short and fast.
*  And, you know, I just thought he was an interesting person because of his background. I mean, he's
*  you know, a highlands game athlete, professional rugby player. He's doing this high intensity.
*  He's a gigantic dude.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's twice my size. So it's like, my thought is like, okay,
*  here's a guy who has a similar nutrition plan that I do, but he's doing the exact opposite
*  athlete type stuff. He's twice the size of me. We're kind of two ends of the spectrum from like
*  an athletic standpoint. So, like, I was just interested in kind of like, you know,
*  what he was doing and what he was up to. And that's kind of why we started the podcast together.
*  But yeah, I mean, when you, one of the things that Sean always says on the podcast, I think is
*  kind of a better reflection on is he'll say, I don't, the only thing I know for certain is that
*  I'm wrong about something. So it's like, you know, it gets, I think it gets tough for someone like
*  him who gets identified as the, like the face of the carnivore movement. Because then like,
*  you get all the positive and the negative coming your way too. And I mean, you can feed into that.
*  But I mean, when we, when we record our podcasts and stuff, I mean, he's a very open-minded person.
*  We're, we're, we're looking for answers and we're asking questions and things like that. And it's,
*  it's, it's, you know, it's a learning experience, I think for me anyway. So
*  Pete Slauson Well, he clearly enjoys fucking with vegans.
*  Sean O'Toole Well, yeah. And it's
*  Pete Slauson He's been on this fruitarian kick lately,
*  which is kind of hilarious. I didn't know there was that many of those people out there.
*  And one of them just died. One fruitarian doctor died during a fast.
*  Sean O'Toole Oh, really?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. And Sean was talking about it on his YouTube channel.
*  Sean O'Toole Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson There's people out there that think that you
*  could just get by by only eating fruit. Jesus Christ, folks.
*  Sean O'Toole You know, I've got a theory with like social
*  media and that stuff in general is that like, for a lot of the, a lot of the people who are most
*  active on it, it's like they're, they either take it 100% serious, or it's like kind of a joke or a
*  game. And then when those two polar ants meet, it's that's where you get the big kind of like,
*  like blow up interactions and then, and then it becomes a like, kind of a game of like, well,
*  the vegan told me that like I should die or something like that. So then I'm going to go
*  tell that vegan that, you know, this, that, and it goes back and forth, back and forth, back and
*  forth.
*  Pete Slauson So stupid. This is such a waste of time.
*  Sean O'Toole Well, the most interesting, the one I always get a kick out of though,
*  along those lines is someone will come up with like a picture of like, here's, here's the human's,
*  you know, jaw system and this clearly means we're, we're frugivores. And then someone will say,
*  well, look at the, the digestive track of a human being. It is clearly designed more to be eating
*  meat or animal products. And you know, they go back and forth with different like parts of the
*  human anatomy to try to like prove that we're vegetarian or vegan, fruitarian or whatever.
*  Pete Slauson The arguments are so stupid.
*  Sean O'Toole Yeah. And then I'm thinking the whole time,
*  I'm like, so what we have here is people who can have, have specific traits that are good for eating
*  fruits and vegetables and some specific traits that are good for eating animal products.
*  So, we're omnivores.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it's biologically, it's been established.
*  Sean O'Toole Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson There's no real controversy. The controversy is fake.
*  Particularly from the vegans where they say that we're herbivores and our jaws are designed to
*  crush, you know, roots and shit. Like, no, we had tools and fire for fucking hundreds of thousands
*  of years, you knuckleheads.
*  Sean O'Toole You know who, one of my favorite podcasts
*  we've done was with this guy, Dr. Bill Schindler. He's an archaeologist out of, I think it was
*  Washington University. And he's such a cool dude. He like, told, well, he said something that was
*  really resonated with me where he said, you know, humans, we're unique in that, like, we've,
*  like, over time developed ways to use like tools and things like that to liberate nutrients.
*  So, to look at anything in its raw state is kind of the missed the point of why humans are the way
*  they are.
*  Pete Slauson Sure. Well, like lentils.
*  Sean O'Toole Mm hmm.
*  Pete Slauson Like, I've seen this argument that human beings aren't supposed to eat meat because
*  if we were, we'd be able to just rip it apart and eat it with our own teeth and go eat a squirrel
*  with your face. Well, guess what? You can eat a squirrel with your face if you're so inclined.
*  If you really wanted to do that, you could do it without tools. You know what you can't do? You
*  can't eat a lot of beans without cooking them. Like, we've figured things out, folks. I mean,
*  cassava, in the jungle, they figured out that you have to cook this stuff and strain it. And
*  it's a primary staple of the diets of many people that live in the jungle.
*  Sean O'Toole Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson And it's fucking toxic as shit if you don't do that. I mean, it literally produces
*  cyanide. Cyanide is produced by cassava, which is like one of their primary foods. They just
*  figured it out. Just like you figured out you have to boil lentils. Just like you figured out you
*  have to cook beans. I mean, you can't eat most of these things that we eat are not good to eat if
*  you just eat them in their raw state. Some things like fruits are, some vegetables are. But some
*  just are not. And this is the same with meat and this idea that you're supposed to be where we're
*  clearly an herbivore because of the fact that we're not supposed to be killing animals with
*  our teeth. That's so dumb. We kill animals with tools. And we've done it for so long that our
*  bodies have adapted. We've adapted to the fact that we have clothes. That's why we're not covered
*  in hair, you fucking idiots. This is real clear, obvious stuff. People who live in the coldest
*  climates in the world aren't covered in hair. You know?
*  Yeah. You know, and it was interesting because like what you're saying too, when we had Bill on
*  the show, he's got this unique experience where he's actually gone in and visited these indigenous
*  tribes that have been relatively untouched by modern society to basically with the one question
*  of like, well, how do you eat? So he's been, he's seen like a variety of different stuff. I think
*  he even had a show on National Geographic for a while that looked into some of this, but he,
*  like just to show you the polarization of what humans can kind of do, he went and he visited
*  Samburo, which is a branch of the Maasai over in Africa. You know, they're basically drinking
*  blood and milk for a huge portion of their nutrition. And you know, so you have this tribe
*  that's basically on a primarily animal-based nutrition plan and they're super healthy. He
*  said that they were maybe one of the most healthy groups of people he's seen from just like a
*  physical stature, like tooth health and that sort of thing. But then he also went down to,
*  I think it was in South America, I can't remember the name of the tribe, but they found a way to
*  basically liberate nutrients from a poisonous potato. And-
*  Pete Slauson Cassava.
*  Jared Slauson Is that what it was? Maybe it was cassava?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
*  Jared Slauson Oh, okay.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, so I think it was, maybe it was cassava.
*  Pete Slauson Maybe there's other ones as well.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson I think there is a purple, some weird purple potato that has a similar sort of a
*  toxic profile.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah. And what he said was this tribe that ate basically mostly potatoes,
*  what they would do is they'd literally dig like a pit and put like, some like, thousands of pounds
*  of these potatoes in there and let them sit there and like ferment, I guess, for like up to six
*  months. And then they would actually make this clay that they would use and because there was
*  still a toxin or something in there that they needed to kind of prevent from like interacting.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, this is something totally different.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, so they take this clay and there's a potato and when they dip the potato
*  in this clay, it like binds to that toxin so it becomes, it doesn't become an issue when you eat
*  it. So like by itself, that potato could potentially kill you, I guess, but with the clay,
*  it doesn't. And so I was like-
*  Pete Slauson How the fuck did they figure that out?
*  Jared Slauson That's what I want to know. I'm just thinking like,
*  how much trial and error goes into that? It's like, oh, this guy dropped dead, this guy dropped,
*  oh, this guy lived, I guess.
*  Pete Slauson There's so many things like that in the jungle. You just have to really wonder,
*  how do they develop all these different medicines and all these different ways of eating things?
*  Jared Slauson And it's just fascinating when like you're,
*  I guess when your only goal when you wake up in the morning is to find your next meal
*  and kind of build enough around so that you can kind of survive, like you put a lot of time and
*  energy into it. But yeah, it is interesting to think like how they all got passed along from
*  generation to generation and how it got fine tuned to where it is today. But I think it's cool to
*  look at that stuff when it just comes to your own nutrition too and kind of when you understand like
*  it's less about like this food is bad for me or this particular food item is bad for me across the
*  board and this one is great for me across the board, more so about, well, this is what this food
*  does well, this is what this one does well, so let's find like you mix and match to where you
*  get the profile that you're looking for.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I think the problem is what we were saying before is that people are entering
*  into these conversations with this goal that they want to achieve, this goal being plants are bad
*  for you or meat is bad for you or we're supposed to be only eating meat or we're supposed to be only
*  eating plants and here's why and you know, you have this confirmation bias, you're not looking
*  at any other piece of evidence and particularly the biological variability of human beings is
*  pretty incredible. I mean, I can eat peanuts all day long. If you're allergic to peanuts,
*  you're dead if you eat one. I mean, it's, we're strange creatures and what is this changing?
*  What do you got here, Jamie? The ancient, oh, here it is, the ancient Andean tradition of eating clay
*  may have helped to protect health.
*  Jared Polin I think it goes back to ancient Egypt. I was just trying to find out how far back this
*  goes and you can still buy clay dust right now. That's what I was just kind of looking at up to.
*  Pete Slauson So eating dirt is good for you.
*  Jared Polin Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson So they found a way to like package the dust and…
*  Jared Polin Right.
*  Pete Slauson Peruvian clay dust.
*  Jared Polin This is a whole history on potatoes and how it changes the world and like…
*  Pete Slauson Wild potatoes are laced with solanine and tomatine, toxic compounds believed to defend
*  plants against attacks from dangerous organisms like fungi, bacteria, and human beings. We are
*  dangerous organisms. Cooking often breaks down such chemical defenses but solanine and tomatine
*  are unaffected by heat in the mountains. Wow, say that word. Guanaco and Vicuña?
*  Jared Polin Like llamas.
*  Pete Slauson Wild relatives of the llama. Lick clay before eating poisonous plants. The fucking
*  llamas figured it out. The toxins stick, more technically absorb, to the fine clay particles
*  in the animal's stomachs passing through the digestive system without affecting it.
*  Mimicking this process, mountain peoples apparently learned to dunk wild potatoes in a gravy made of
*  clay and water. Eventually, they bred less toxic potatoes, though some of the old poisonous
*  varieties remain flavored for their resistance to… favored for their resistance to frost.
*  Clay dust is still sold in Peruvian and Bolivian markets to accompany them. Wow.
*  Jared Polin That's interesting.
*  Pete Slauson That's crazy. But it tastes like shit, though.
*  Still dirt. Still eating dirt with potatoes. But look, people do what they gotta do to stay alive.
*  We're just so fortunate we don't have to do that. You know, you can go to a crossroads and
*  have a nice vegan meal if you want to. You're not really worried about staying alive anymore.
*  We're worried…
*  Jared Polin Well, taste…
*  Primarily about… yeah, about… well, you know, people are worried about the environment. They're
*  worried about the health consequences of certain diets and the environmental consequences of
*  certain diets and, you know, and these people… this is what I've really gotten into after Chris
*  Kresser was on the podcast recently debunking the game changers when he was talking about
*  the positive net benefits of regenerative farming. I don't think that's clearly been established
*  worldwide or in large scale. Like, in terms of… and maybe it can be…
*  Jared Polin Like, can we do it and feed…
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Jared Polin Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, can we feed the entire country on that? I mean, I don't…
*  Jared Polin Yeah, you know, I think that's… I mean,
*  that's the million dollar question right now too, right? Like, well, how are we gonna
*  feed however many they're predicting? Like, how are we gonna feed the 10 billion people we're
*  gonna see in X number of years? And I think it's interesting and it's certainly worth thinking
*  about. But like, it's also like, well, how far do we keep kicking that ball down the road before
*  we find ourselves in a situation where like, you know, then what's the next question? 15 billion,
*  20 billion, and so on and so forth. And eventually, like, you know, we just overpopulate the world and
*  it ends really badly for us. Pete Slauson
*  Well, diseases usually follow overpopulation. I think the real key for us, I think is going to be
*  and I think this is within our lifetime, is going to be lab-created meat. And I think they're really
*  close to doing that. And I think if you have some sort of ethical, lab-created, nutritious meat where
*  you don't have to worry about suffering or death, if this has been established, then we open up a
*  whole new avenue of exploration. Because now you can say, okay, all these people that are vegan for
*  this moral and ethical sort of dilemma that they have with animal agriculture, killing animals,
*  suffering, let's take all that out. Now you can eat lab-created meat that has absolutely no suffering
*  attached to it. Let's find out how healthy things really are. And let's find out how many people
*  stay vegan and how many people revert to more omnivorous diet, which, I mean, there's,
*  this is something that vegans hate to hear, but it is a fact. 84% of people who start a vegan diet
*  quit. Now, is that because of taste? Is that because of, and then there's the argument that,
*  well, people that do it over a long period of time, you get a higher retention rate. That's
*  fine. But 84% still is the number. I mean, it doesn't matter if you get a high retention rate
*  for people that have doing it more than two years or more than three years. Like, if you stick with
*  it, you can do it. No, they're just more committed. But the reality is 84% quit. This is what's been
*  firmly established. What would the number be if there was ethical, humane, lab-created meat that
*  had no suffering attached to it at all? It's just science-based. It's just made with compounds and,
*  whatever they use to create this stuff. That would be interesting. It'd be interesting to find out,
*  could we eliminate large-scale animal agriculture in favor of lab-created meat? And what, if any,
*  environmental factors would there be that would be negative that were attached to lab-created meat?
*  Because you've got to think, whenever you're making anything, right, industrial, large-scale,
*  you're going to have waste. What is that waste? Can that waste be mitigated? Can they figure out
*  some sort of a way to have some sort of net positive effect where that waste is utilized
*  in some sort of a form where it actually can contribute to the natural processes of soil
*  regeneration and manure and composting and things along those lines? Yeah. No, I think it's interesting
*  and we're in an interesting time for sure. It'll be interesting to see where they get with that and
*  everything else with that. You brought up an interesting point too, not to keep going down
*  the rabbit hole, but the other thing that I thought really interesting was when you look at waste
*  components. I feel like we're not maybe looking at that as much as we should be when we're talking
*  about trying to feed a bunch of people. It's like, well, maybe we should start with what we're
*  throwing away that we wouldn't have to. Oh, yeah. And I think, at first I just thought, well,
*  there's a lot of food thrown away at restaurants. There's a lot of stuff that's thrown away just
*  because it doesn't meet standards for the grocery store. It's like, let's start there.
*  And I actually had asked Dr. Schindler about that. He actually did a study with some of his grad
*  students where they looked at, I think they took 30 white tail deer and they processed it down to
*  the very last potential calorie to find out how much is wasted even in a deer that, say you go
*  and you shoot a deer and then you take it to the process and get it all done. He said it was between,
*  I think it was between like 13 to 30 days worth of human nutrition that gets wasted
*  in a single white tail deer. Whoa. So like, well, here's the problem with that idea. A waste
*  is only if you do something with it, if you leave it in the field, there's no waste. Right. Like if
*  you just killed a deer, it's not, it just left it there. There's no waste. You're feeding animals.
*  Right. I mean, they're going to absolutely destroy that thing. It's going to be gone
*  in a short period of time, including the bones. They'll eat the bones. And if they don't eat the
*  bones, the bones will eventually deteriorate and become part of the soil. This is what happens
*  when animals die. Sure. So I guess maybe the way to look at then is like, what are we, if we're
*  looking to just, if our objective is to feed as many people as possible and we're maximizing the
*  amount of nutrients we can acquire from a specific thing, like we're leaving a lot on the table or
*  we're giving a lot to different areas, like different animals and things that would be.
*  Well, we're doing it wrong. You know, we're putting our waste in bags and then we're throwing it into
*  the ground fills. I mean, it landfills. Have you seen, they did this aerial study of Los Angeles.
*  They're trying to find out where most of the methane comes from. They were trying to figure
*  out it's fucking landfills, man. Landfills are disgusting. And this is not how it's supposed to
*  be. It's supposed to be animals are supposed to have access to what's left over. I mean,
*  this is what would happen if a bear killed a moose, right? If a bear killed a moose,
*  it's going to consume a big portion of the body and then it's going to leave whatever's left. And
*  then rodents and vultures and then eventually insects and bacteria are going to break it down.
*  And this is a natural cycle of life for animals. This is how it's supposed to be. What we do is we
*  take it, we cut it up, we eat some of it, we throw some of it away, we put that in a plastic bag,
*  we zip tie it, we dig a fucking hole in the ground and we throw that bag in there. It's ludicrous.
*  We know better. We do know better. We understand the whole process of these things breaking down
*  in the wild and what happens to them. We understand that there's animals, that their entire diet
*  consists of eating animals that other animals have killed and they leave some of it behind.
*  We're supposed to leave it behind. It's supposed to be a part of the whole cycle of life.
*  We were supposed to compost. All these things are supposed to be natural. When I was a kid,
*  my mom and my stepdad were part of this cooperative farm thing and we started composting.
*  And we didn't do it for very long because we eventually wound up moving and we stopped being
*  a part of this thing. But I thought it was really interesting because I was a little kid. I was
*  thinking like, oh, I never thought of that before. You take your food waste and you separate it from
*  like paper. You know, give your paper waste and then you have like leftover tomatoes or something
*  like that. And all that would go into one specific bin and that bin would go into this big thing.
*  It was like, it was made with like chicken wire and leaves and you had a lid over it and like it
*  was a wood box and you would throw everything in there and it would all sort of rot and compost.
*  And then you would take that stuff and you would use it in the garden. And this is how composting
*  is done. This is how fertilizer is made and this is what you're supposed to do. This is like small
*  scale regenerative farming. And what we're doing is assholes. We take our food, we put it in
*  fucking bags, we zip tie it shut and we chuck it in the ground. It's dumb. It's a really dumb way
*  of doing things. I just feel like that is something that we could really leverage at the educational
*  level. Like, you know, we've got schools where we were housing these kids and like, you know,
*  one of the biggest hurdles I think is like we got them indoors sitting in desks for seven, eight
*  hours a day and then we, why not get them out and learn that and do that? And we have these
*  mini little like regenerative areas. Then you learn it and then it doesn't get forgotten when
*  you're an adult as easily. Well, we're so enamored with this idea of working. You know, we're so
*  enamored with this idea of getting a job. We're so enamored with this idea of the structure of
*  civilization as it stands in 2019 is the way to go. So we're teaching kids how to complete
*  this life that they're born into the way it's established for their parents, the way it's
*  established for their neighborhood. Get in your car, drive to work, work all day, come home,
*  you know, eat what you can, throw the rest of the garbage, go back to work in the morning. And this
*  is nonsense. This is not how you have to do it. You don't have to do anything. There's a bunch
*  of different ways to live this life and there's only a hundred years if you're lucky. So this
*  thing that we're setting up, we're setting up kids to essentially be as miserable as everybody
*  else before them doing the exact same thing that everybody else has done. Like maybe you can get
*  lucky, like I have been or like you've been and you find something that you actually enjoy doing.
*  Sure.
*  Then you get lucky. Like, oh my God, you know, Zach found a job that he really loves and he got
*  really good at it. And now he actually has joy in what he does. But there's a lot of different
*  places in this country alone where you can live and you could do things in a non-traditional
*  manner and you can get by and you'll probably be healthier and happier than someone that gets stuck
*  in the same goddamn civilization cycle, this industrialized cycle that we're all in.
*  And we don't teach kids that. What we teach kids is that here's history, here's math, get your SATs
*  in, get the score, go to the college that you want, get a job. And this is the standard path
*  that seems to be rewarded. And this is what, and if you say, well, I'm going to drop out and find
*  myself, oh, good luck, loser. You know, you're going to fuck up your life. You know, what are
*  you doing, man? You're not even going to college. Jesus Christ. And it's very unfortunate that we
*  have this incredibly rigid system. And it really makes people feel like, made me feel like a failure.
*  I didn't fit into the system. I just, because I have ADD or whatever emotional issues, whatever
*  I had, I just could not sit still in class and concentrate. I had way too much fucking energy.
*  This is just, this was just not for me. I was twiddling my thumbs and tapping the floor and
*  looking at the clock. When that fucking thing hit, I was gone. And I didn't want to do home.
*  I literally didn't do any homework my entire high school career. I didn't do any. I just got by
*  being smart enough to pass tests by learning what I learned in class and not putting in any fucking
*  extra effort. I just wanted to get out and I found something that I was good at. I figured it out.
*  I found, I got lucky that I did that. But for a lot of people, they just live these lives
*  of frustration, you know, and they never do find a thing. And they're not taught to find a thing.
*  And there's also, I think there's a great satisfaction to working on something that you enjoy
*  whether it's working with your hands or working on something that's creative
*  and working with the land. You know, you talk to people that run their own little organic farms.
*  Like I know this couple that runs an organic farm and man, when they talk about their food,
*  they talk about the vegetables they grow and the stuff they grow, they like beam.
*  Pete They're excited about it.
*  They're excited. It's a natural, there's a gravity that we have towards that. It's a
*  natural human reward to be able to cultivate your own food. If you can make a salad out of some
*  stuff that you grew yourself, man, that feels amazing. It really does. And there's people that
*  could be making a living doing that and they're never encouraged to do so and they might be way
*  happier than selling insurance.
*  Jared Yeah. Yeah, no, I agree.
*  And you can feed other people too, man. That's the other thing. Like if you could figure out a way
*  to run an organic garden and you do compost, you don't use pesticides, you do everything organic
*  and everything is regenerative and you actually can feed people, my God, like how good would you
*  feel?
*  Pete Pretty satisfying.
*  Jared Yes. Yeah. I would think really satisfying. It's not for everybody,
*  but it's got to be for somebody. And they're not being, no one's teaching you that in school.
*  Pete Right. Yeah.
*  Jared You have to be one of those outside the box thinkers because school is essentially set up for
*  scale, right? It's set up for you got 500 kids, you got to turn them in and not losers.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared How do I get 500 kids to not be a loser? Well, just standard path, you know, like standard
*  American diets, like standard American education, these like standard paths that will work for
*  X amount of people. You get 10 people, seven of them won't be losers if you just
*  shove them into this machine and pump them out in this fucking form.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Jared It's a bummer.
*  Pete Uh-huh. Now here we're getting education advice from the ultra marathon runner.
*  Yeah, but you're a good guy to get education advice from because…
*  Jared Well, I was a teacher for five years, so.
*  Pete Well, it's also you're a successful guy at an unusual thing. You know, you found a thing
*  that you really excel at that you actually enjoy. And that is for so many people, the ultimate goal
*  of life. Like, you can make a lot of money in this life, but you will not be as happy,
*  and it's really contrary to like capitalist ideas. Like, we were taught to think that the more money
*  you make, the happier you'll be. That's definitely not true. But you will make more money if you're
*  happier with what you do, which sounds like a contradiction. But it's not. You'll excel.
*  And if you're excelling, whatever you're doing is profitable. Obviously, there's some things
*  that you can excel at that are just, there's no fucking way to make a lot of money as a bowler.
*  If you're like, I'm really into bowling, well, you're kind of fucked. Because it's just one of
*  those things that nobody gives a shit about.
*  Pete But if you find something else you're interested in too.
*  Jared Yeah, it would be nice if you found something that actually paid the bills. But
*  if you can find something that you enjoy, you'll have an infinitely happier life. It's just, you
*  can do that. You just have to find those, you have to explore those things. And I think that's where
*  we fail kids. We fail kids in giving them this landscape of possibilities that actually does
*  exist. I think there's a landscape of possibilities for what you can do. And everyone is definitely,
*  I don't want to be an ultra marathon runner, man. If you and I were competing, I'm fucked, okay?
*  I'm not going to win. I'm not going to excel. I'm built like a chimp. I'm not the guy that's
*  supposed to be running 200 miles. It's just your realm. And it's also, it's not what, I don't desire
*  to do that. Conversely, if you had to become a stand-up comedian, you'd probably be like, well,
*  fuck this. I don't want to do any thinking about things that's funny. And the first time you bomb,
*  you're like, what am I doing with my life? And it's, everybody has a different personality and
*  these different personalities and these different interests and desires. They take different paths.
*  And I think we need to open that up to people more and just sort of in some way, encourage people
*  to seek more, to seek, to genuinely try to find the things that interest you. Maybe you should be
*  a fly fishing guide. Maybe you should be a guy who makes homemade mugs out of exotic hardwood.
*  Maybe you're a knife maker. Maybe you're a person who, maybe you should make fucking
*  dream catchers. I don't know. Don't make dream catchers. Does anybody really like dream catchers?
*  Those are like something you buy and then you put it on the wall and you go, what the fuck am I
*  doing? I'm like pretending I'm in Native America or something. But there's things you can do, man.
*  You just have to find that thing. And I think that's so hard for people. And that's why people,
*  when they find someone like yourself that's doing this unusual unorthodox thing and you're
*  extremely successful at it, it becomes so attractive to people to hear your story.
*  2.30
*  Yeah. And I think it's, I would have never guessed I'd be doing what I'm doing now 10 years ago. So
*  it's equally surprising to me, I think sometimes. But it is interesting when you think about just
*  where you thought you would maybe be and then where you end up and all that stuff in between.
*  And ultimately, I think if you, I think you want to be smart about stuff. Like I didn't necessarily
*  just quit my job and say, I'm going to be an ultra marathon runner. You kind of have like a
*  few different options available or you just keep options open to like, for me personally,
*  I like to coach too. So I'm going to do some of that and that helps supplement things. And then
*  podcasting has always been a fun thing to do. So historically I always go on podcasts. And then
*  a couple of years ago, it was like, well, if it's this much fun to go on them, it must be fun to
*  do them too. So starting these other, I think when people start kind of really exploring where
*  their curiosities are, you find these different avenues too. And it just kind of snowballs a
*  little bit as opposed to being, maybe you start out making the dream catcher and then you become
*  something else.
*  3.00
*  Right, right. You just get really into feathers. Did you ever think about doing something like,
*  do you get revelations post-training? Do you, because one of the things that I always have
*  after like really good hard workouts, first of all, I'm always filled with gratitude. I'm always
*  like really thankful after long, hard workouts. And I've thought about doing this thing called
*  the gratitude series, where I do a podcast like immediately after like really hard workouts and
*  just talk about my feelings. I mean, it sounds fucking corny and self-indulgent, but realistically
*  I think there's some lessons that I learned off of really hard workouts. You know, where it's like
*  at the end of it, you know, when it's all done, first of all, there's always this feeling like
*  eight out of 10 times, I don't want to work out. Really eight out of 10. I work out 10 out of 10,
*  but eight out of 10, I'm like, fuck this.
*  4.00
*  You're always happy.
*  5.00
*  Always, always. And that's the hump, man. That fucking hump of just shut that part of your brain
*  up and just start moving. And then once you start moving, you start breaking a sweat. Once you start
*  breaking a sweat, it becomes easier. It starts feeling good. Then you start getting some
*  satisfaction like, ooh, I almost didn't do this today. Here I am doing it. And then sometimes
*  it's fucking, you know, sometimes I'm looking at a three mile run, which is nothing for you,
*  but a mile in, I'm like, fuck, two more to go. Jesus Christ. And I'm running hills and shit.
*  But when it's over, it's like, yes, I did it. You know, when I get back to the car and I'm
*  saying hi to people, hey, what's up? How are you doing? Waving to the neighbors,
*  dog's exhausted. I'm happy. Everybody's pumped. You know, it's like, and I feel good. I feel warm.
*  I feel friendly. I feel loving. I feel, you know, I want to call people and tell them I care about
*  them. It's like, it's like, there's moments like post-workout in particular, where you just feel
*  really good. And I think life is sometimes about getting over those periods of feeling kind of
*  shitty or low energy or lethargic or unrested or whatever the fuck it is and just pushing through
*  that because you know the territory. You've been there before and then developing a habit of being
*  able to do that and being able to know and have faith in the process and understand that this,
*  yeah, yeah, yeah. I know you don't want to do it. Shut the fuck up and go. Just go. And then once
*  you do go, you always feel better. Yeah, no, I a hundred percent agree. And I think in my own
*  training, like I get that from a lot of different workouts. But the one that I really love is like,
*  when I get closer to a race and I like what I was saying before you start dialing things in to be
*  more specific to the activity you're trying to prepare for, I'll do a phase of training where
*  I'm running kind of in an area of about like 150 to 155 beats per minute. So I can go like on a,
*  it's just fast enough where I feel like I'm really kind of like working. But it's also slow enough
*  where I can go for quite a while so I can like log a really big run. And when I was training for
*  this last race at the Pettit Center, I had a training cycle where I hit, I had a four week block
*  where I had one deload a week, which is just basically a reduction of volume and intensity
*  Why is it called deload? Because I'm like reducing volume and intensity. And the other three though
*  were build up ones. I had like 130 mile a week, somewhere right around 130 and then 250 mile weeks.
*  And they were just like basically loaded with like kind of just faster than or right about kind of
*  a hundred mile intensity. So, you know, I would do, and you can maybe pull it up. I think I have a
*  picture on my Instagram page of the, I did these key workouts where I'd go to a track and I would
*  just do loops around the track. And it'd be like anywhere between 27 to like 32 miles at that kind
*  of intensity. And you just get into like a flow and a rhythm and it's once you kind of get moving,
*  it feels great. And afterwards, yeah, you feel great the whole rest of the day and you just want
*  to kind of go out and do it again. You almost have to be careful not to do too much at a certain point.
*  Who structures those? Do you structure them yourself?
*  Yeah. Yeah. To kind of go back to what we were talking about in the beginning,
*  like when I structure a plan, ideally I start out, I start out with a good base,
*  a good aerobic base, which I typically kind of retain almost year round. I'll take like off
*  season, but I like to follow principle where I'll let myself kind of lose some of that peak fitness,
*  just so it's sustainable. Cause staying at your peak fitness level is not sustainable.
*  So I let myself get like just out of shape enough so that I'm not always at that level.
*  And then I start kind of building in the structure towards the race itself, which starts with those
*  shorter, faster intervals since they're further away. And then I get closer and closer to the race
*  where I'm doing things that are more specific. So like the next step would be, I'd be doing some
*  longer intervals or kind of like what you consider like an anaerobic threshold type workout, which
*  generally speaking is about like your max intensity. If you did like a 60 minute all out
*  time trial and then, you know, that's still not specific to a hundred miles because I'm out there
*  for 11 hours. So I'm, I'm kind of still moving closer to that slower race pace. Yeah. And it's
*  I mean, it just follows the principle of, you know, hitting all the systems of training like
*  you would in any other periodized endurance plan, but always keeping that compass of the stuff you do
*  for the, or the intensity of the race itself is the type of work you should be doing closest to it.
*  So you're really just optimizing when you're closer to the race itself.
*  How do you know what your peak fitness is? Like when you say that you want to,
*  you can't really maintain the peak fitness. You want to back off a little bit so that you can
*  just keep your training running. How do you know where that is and how do you know that you cannot
*  expand that? And then, yeah, no, that's a great question. That's somewhat subjective too. I mean,
*  you can analyze things if you want to go into like heart rate variability type things. If you,
*  but that's a little bit more on the micro level for me personally, like usually I'll get to a
*  point where like I'll do a race and you can just kind of tell like I'm exhausted from that. And I
*  like to think of it kind of two-folded where like physical recovery and mental recovery.
*  So if I do a big race and afterwards, like I can't even like bring myself to think of another big
*  training block. I know I need to like let myself kind of get a little bit out of that fitness state,
*  that peak fitness state and just kind of reset or hit the reset button.
*  So this is just from years and years of training.
*  Yeah, there's trial and error. And you make mistakes. I mean, in the past, you know,
*  a lot of times I'll do one, I think I got one more race left for me and then it goes badly.
*  So, right, right. Now, what is a long day? Like say if you're getting prepared for this 100-mile
*  race and you know, you're going to have to run for 11 plus hours. What's a long day for you?
*  Yeah. So the longest run I did for this particular one was three and a half hours.
*  It was, I think 32 miles or something somewhere in that neighborhood. I'll do, I'll do, I usually
*  don't push up much past five hours in my own training. If I'm going to do much more than that,
*  I'll just jump in a race. Like the nice thing about Phoenix is there's a race company called
*  Air Viper and they put on like 30 some ultra events every year. So it's like, you can basically,
*  almost every weekend, pretty much. Yeah. That's crazy. So like the guy who raced
*  directed Jamil, he'll let me jump in events when I want to. And so sometimes I'll, if I'm going to
*  do something like say I want to, I'm preparing for a hundred mile and I want to get a really long day,
*  like a seven, eight hour session in, you know, he, I'll just pick like a, like a hundred K type
*  event or like, you know, a 50 mile or type event and just do that at like, I like to say like,
*  I try and those are, you know, those are training tools. So I don't want to necessarily race it all
*  out. But if you can kind of keep yourself at like maybe 80% of what you're capable of, you can get
*  that good long stimulus, but not necessarily beat yourself up so much that it takes away from the
*  race you're preparing for. And so 50 miles would take you or how long would that take you? It
*  depends on the course. Like I just did a 50 mile or actually about a week and a half ago,
*  the JFK 50 mile and that took me five hours and 42 minutes. And that course is kind of, it's got,
*  you go over the Appalachian mountains for about 60 miles and you get on a really flat tow path for
*  about a marathon and then some rolling street hills. So that's not as fast as you can find.
*  You can find, I mean, you can go on a track. How much elevation are you going up and down?
*  That one was about 3000 feet. So it is, but the funny thing about ultra marathon, especially in
*  North America is like, you know, the trails are where a lot of, you know, there's a lot of interest
*  there. So 3000 for 50 is actually considered a relatively flat, fast course. Whoa. You know,
*  it's hilarious. It's really interesting too, cause like some of the, I live just about two hours
*  south of Flagstaff and I mean, there's a group of ultra marathon guys who train up there and they,
*  I got a lot of inspiration from, from two of them specifically for this last race that they
*  did at the Pettit center. One guy's name is Jim Walmsley and he's for my money,
*  probably the best ultra marathoner we have certainly in North America, if not the world.
*  I mean, he, he's got the course record at the Western States, 100, which is the most tested
*  hundred miler in North America. He's got the course record at the Lake Sonoma 50 mile by a pretty big
*  margin. He's actually got the two fastest times, but the next closest person is like 18 minutes
*  behind or something like that. And then he's also got the course record at the JFK 50 mile,
*  the one I just was mentioning before. And these three events are three of the most tested courses
*  that we've had and he's got the course records at all of them and he can probably go faster.
*  So, I mean, some of his training is like, he'll do like 150 mile a week sometimes with like
*  30,000 feet of climbing and descending. And the kicker is one of his training partners,
*  Jared Hazen. So if Jim is the best ultra runner North America has from the male side,
*  Jared Hazen is by far the most underrated. So this guy, he ran the Western States 100 this year.
*  Jim finished first, Jared finished second. Jim broke his course record by running 14 hours and
*  nine minutes on a course that has 17,000 feet of climbing and 23,000 feet of descent.
*  05.00 He ran a hundred miles with that much in 14 hours?
*  Yeah, in Western States, it's considered a running course for the most part too. Like
*  there's crazier ones that get way worse from a climbing and descending standpoint.
*  Like Moab.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, we have to use trekking sticks.
*  Yeah, yeah. So Jared though, Jared, so Jim, he had actually broken the course record the year
*  before and he took like, I think it was like 16 or 17 minutes off the old course record,
*  ran 14 and a half hours. This last next year, he broke his course record with the 14.09. Jared
*  came in second in, I think it was 14.23 or 26, just behind Jim, basically pushing him all day.
*  So any other time Jared would have won that race except for that year. And it would have been like,
*  you know, a huge story for him. And, you know, it just, I mean, it was an amazing performance
*  from those two guys and just watching kind of their training and then their performances,
*  because I was out there crewing and pacing my wife, it was like a huge motivator for me when I
*  kind of got into the training buildup for that race at the Pennant Center. So.
*  Wow.
*  It's just funny with ultra marathon because you have such a variety. I think we talked about this
*  a bit the last time as I mean, you can have like these 50k races that are like, I mean,
*  there's 50k races that have 10,000 feet of climbing and descending. And then you can have
*  these six day events that are on a 400 meter track.
*  Right. Which is much different. Yeah. You are doing something really bonkers right now, right?
*  You're attempting to run across the entire country and to break the record.
*  Yeah. So this is kind of in its infancy a bit from the planning stages. So it probably won't
*  happen in the immediate future, but someone you're very familiar with actually Justin Wren.
*  Yeah.
*  He's got the fight for their God and I was actually on the phone with him last night. And
*  one thing I've kind of been interested in since I started ultra running is this route. It's a
*  3,100 mile route. Basically it goes from San Francisco to New York and it's been done by,
*  quite a few people both walking, running, Pete Koselnick, he's got the course record. I know
*  he averaged like 70 miles a day. Yeah. So it's like, it's a pretty insane route and I've always
*  been interested in doing it. And I just haven't really been motivated, I guess, to really attempt
*  it or I just didn't, I guess I just really didn't know when I would do it. I just kind of idea I
*  would. And then last year, one of my sponsors, the F-bomb, those nut butter sachets.
*  I love those. But my friend RZA and John L. Rollins, they believe that the name should be changed.
*  They believe nut butter has a negative connotation to heterosexual males who
*  think that it sounds like something comes out of your dick. Any thoughts?
*  A name change would maybe be good. Well, I guess in their defense, there's this called F-bomb,
*  not nut butter, right? So. Right. Right. In general.
*  F-bomb's better, right? It's a better name. Yeah. Good stuff. I love their stuff.
*  Yeah. No, they make a great product and they had actually proposed last year,
*  I think they just were maybe spitballing a little bit, but they're like, hey, would you be ever
*  interested in doing that? Like go running, you know, doing that cross country route.
*  And I was like, yeah, I've been actually wanting to do that at some point. I just
*  haven't gotten around to actually planning it out.
*  How funny is that as a statement? Yeah, I've been wanting to run 3,100 miles across the fucking
*  continent and try to beat the record, which averaged 60 to 70 miles a day.
*  God damn, dude. How would you prepare for that?
*  Yeah. You know, I mean, I'd be in super uncharted territory because I've just
*  haven't done anything like that before. So it would be difficult. You'd be a lot of learning
*  on the fly. I think really the big key thing there is you're managing a lot of stuff with that. Like
*  you want to make sure you're sleeping well throughout that. Cause obviously if you're
*  not sleeping well, it could end badly for you pretty soon. So then I think you just end up
*  trying to do as much specific things as you can to prepare without going overboard. So it's a lot
*  of time on feet. I mean, you can imagine the pace is going to be incredibly slow. There's probably
*  going to be like walking breaks. I'm not going to be like, you know, certainly not going to be
*  running six 48 per mile pace, but my, my, my first thought is like, I'll probably target like a 12 to
*  14 hour range per day. And, uh, whatever I get out of that 12 to 14 days or hours is what I get.
*  And then that gives me kind of the flexibility to have like at least 10 hours of buffer to kind of
*  like prep and sleep and get ready for the next day. Do you know Eddie Ezard is comedian? Are you
*  aware of what he did? When he ran the entire length of the UK, the outside of it with no training,
*  right? He's an animal man. He really is a special person, really is a special person. I remember,
*  only knowing of him as a comedian. Um, and you know, had seen him do a lot of standup before.
*  And then I watched this documentary where he's running. I mean, how many miles, how many different
*  marathons was it was like 26, 27 and 27 days, 27 marathons, 27 days. He did wind up taking one day
*  off or his feet were literally mangled blisters. I can only imagine he wasn't in shape, which is
*  fucking crazy. He's a sheer willpower. I mean, just to do one marathon when you're not in shape,
*  I just can't imagine the, the, the, just the fucking sheer amount of just will, just pure will
*  that it takes to do something like that and to just keep pushing left, right, left, right,
*  left, right, left, right. Even though everything, your head, your brain, your feet, everything,
*  stop, stop, stop. Fuck you. Left, right, left, right, left, right. I mean, he ran
*  how many thousand miles was it? The entire length of the UK all over the outside.
*  Another one too though. He did 43 marathons. Oh Christ. He did one in South Africa, right?
*  43 and 51 days was his first one. And then 27 and 27 days was the second one.
*  43, 43 fucking marathons. The article in 2009 comedian,
*  Eliella was celebrating after finishing his 43rd marathon in 51 days.
*  He's really, really interesting guy. Yeah. I mean, he's, he's Eddie Izzard, but he's a cross
*  dresser. So he's like, it's, he comes out as transgender, I think, but not really because
*  he likes women and he likes women as a man. He just likes dressing as a woman. He's just a really
*  unique guy, but he owns it. You know what I'm saying? Like he is who he is. Sub five hour
*  marathon. The connection is aimed at finishing on a sub five hour marathons, miss his target by 30
*  seconds. Give it to him. Yeah. Yeah. Let's round down in that case. Give an honorary 459.
*  Such a fucking interesting, interesting, thoughtful, intelligent person. Really enjoyed
*  talking to him. But when he's talking about these marathons, you're like, good Lord, man.
*  Like it's hard enough for someone to do who's like you, like for a guy like you to run 40,
*  what, how many marathons? 40 what? What are you saying? A lot, let's say 40. For you to run 40
*  marathons in 40 days is fucking bonkers, right? Yeah. That'd be a, that'd be a bigger training
*  block than I've ever done for sure. That's crazy. And you're a fucking world record holder. You've
*  got a goddamn standup comedian out there. Right. Yeah. It's amazing what people can do when they
*  decide they're going to do it. Yes. Yes. But yeah, I mean, I think with, for, for this particular run,
*  you know, I probably would have kept punting it down the road in, you know, had I not talked to
*  Justin Wren, to be honest with you, like, you know, when you do something like that, like part of the
*  reason I think you do that is for me anyway, is when I see like endurance, ultra endurance sport,
*  too, it can be a very selfish sport because you're, you know, you're putting in tons of training.
*  Race day is like an all day effort with tons of people helping you out. Like they're taking time
*  out of their schedule, their day to come out there, crew pace, essentially, like be your,
*  your support system while you're out there kind of trying to, you know, do all these things.
*  So, you know, part of it is like, I want to try to give back in a, in a, in a way as well, as opposed
*  to just always going out and racing for my own, my own sake. And what will be done? How will it,
*  will you have sponsors like? Yeah, hopefully what we'll do is I was talking to Justin.
*  Can we sponsor you? Absolutely. Really? Yeah.
*  We wear like a JRE logo on one of your shirts or something. No doubt about it. Yeah. All right.
*  We're in. Let's do it. Awesome. We got, we got one sponsor on board. Here we go. Yeah. Hell yeah.
*  But yeah. So like when I talked to Justin, I mean, Justin is, I mean, you know, Justin,
*  while he's been on the show, that guy, and I think it was on here that I heard his podcast for the
*  first time. I know I heard him tell, I guess what you would call his origin story here. And I think
*  I heard it again on like the mind pump media guys podcast. And it's when I described just listening
*  to Justin Renn's podcast or his interviews to people, I try to say like, well, it kind of comes
*  in these stages where he tells his background story of like his experience with bullying.
*  And at first you just, your heart just sinks for the guy. You're thinking like, well, how could anyone
*  have to go through that? I would never want him to go through that. And you kind of transition into
*  this phase of like, you kind of get nervous and anxious because you're thinking like, well,
*  who did I say something mean to when I was younger or who did I, who did I potentially affect in a
*  negative way? And then it's like, then you just want to try to do something to support. And,
*  you know, it's, it's really, when you look at someone like Justin Renn, it's, it's mind boggling
*  to me that this guy isn't like an internationally known hero or leader yet anyway. Well, he's
*  becoming, he's getting big. He's getting big. I mean, the only thing that's holding him back is
*  he keeps getting sick. Yeah. Well, and that's just it. He's got a fucking crazy, you know,
*  his parasites he's got now. They don't even know what they are. He picked up some parasites in the
*  Congo. They can't even identify them specifically. And it's, he's really suffering health-wise.
*  And you would never know talking to him. Like he just goes about it. Like the guy's gotten
*  malaria. Like most people would probably say, okay, I went over to Africa. I got malaria. I helped
*  some people out. I'm good. I'm good. Now, now someone, you know, we'll raise some money for
*  this charity and we'll send it over to him or something like that. No, he keeps going back and
*  keeps getting malaria three times. Yeah. Yeah. And now he's got the unknown parasite. So like,
*  when I think of like what we, I think maybe like, I mean, Justin Renn is like next level when it
*  comes to like a leader, I think. And I think in the current, especially in the current climate,
*  like, you know, our leaders today tend to be, you know, people like celebrities, athletes,
*  and then politicians and things like that. And it's like, you look around and it can be
*  very underwhelming about just like, you know, some of like, like how badly are like, how badly are
*  people actually trying to help people and how, how much, how many of these like politicians actually
*  care about poor people? How many of them actually care about someone who's disenfranchised or how
*  much, how many of them actually care about- Right. Why are they doing it? Are they doing it to just
*  get elected or do they actually care? Well, Justin, it's just care. Yes. It's all care.
*  There's no worry at all about ulterior motives. They don't exist. There's no ulterior motive
*  to sleep on a dirt floor in a grass shack with the pygmies like he's done for months at a time.
*  He's just doing it for love. Yeah. Yeah. So I think like when, when I look at like,
*  I think people want to help and I think people want to do things that are good for humanity,
*  but oftentimes they don't necessarily have that example to kind of like to lead the way.
*  They look into a void in some cases and I think Justin is the type of person who,
*  you know, if the more people we can get to know about him, his story and what he's trying to do
*  on the wells and the farms and with the pygmy as well as his new branch on anti-bullying,
*  the better. So when I reached out to him, I was actually like kind of surprised, like I shot him
*  a note on I think Instagram and Twitter and I thought like he's probably not going to see it
*  because he's not following me. And he responded in like less than a couple hours. Like he followed
*  me, responded back and he's just like, this is so awesome. I feel super honored that you'd want to,
*  you know, help out in some way. And it's like, he's just always looking for opportunities to help
*  like promote this great cause. So then, you know, when I got that response from him, it was like
*  clarification of what I think I, some I already knew about the guy just from listening to him
*  on your show and others that, you know, he's really in this for a big reason. And if, if,
*  if we need a fast track, this cross country event to bring him some, some awareness, we'll,
*  we'll see what we can do. But he's in everything he does. He does to help and promote other people.
*  Even when I was trying to talk to him about his parasite, I had to get him on track. He's like,
*  you got to interview my doctor and fuck your doctor. What's going on, man. What's happening
*  with you? Cause I worry about the guy because he's so selfless when he's talking about like
*  blacking out and all this like, like after training, they got to get him in the shower
*  because he's shivering and he's pale white. I'm like, bro, what is going on with you? Like,
*  what is this? And he's like, Oh, I got to meet my doctor. He's amazing. Like stop,
*  stop with the fucking doctor. I got to want to get, what is happening? He doesn't want to talk
*  about himself. It's amazing. He's the most selfless person I've ever, ever talked to. He's talking
*  about fighting again, right? He's getting over these incredible bouts of antibiotics that,
*  you know, weaken your ligaments, right? Like when you take Cipro or any of these like super intense
*  antibiotics, one of the side effects is a lot of times people get injured, like your ligaments get
*  injured because apparently there's a weakening effect, which is really kind of, it's really
*  fascinating when you think about the human body as an overall organism and that it's really an
*  ecosystem and that when you flood antibiotics into that ecosystem to try to prevent disease from
*  destroying it, you also have these unintended side effects. And one of them is weakened ligaments.
*  And there's a lot of, there's a correlation between people getting staph infection and then
*  blowing out knees, ACLs, you know, tendons and things along those lines afterwards. So both of
*  his shoulders are fucked, you know, and this is post antibiotics and yet he's still talking about
*  fighting so he can bring more awareness to the pygmies. I'm like, bro, please stop. Just get your
*  shoulders fixed. Whatever you got going on, let's, let's heal that up first. And then also find out
*  what the fuck this parasite is. Like you don't even know what this, didn't even know what this is.
*  He's not even thinking about himself. He's like, if I can get in and get a fight in by the end of
*  the year, I'm like the end of the year, man, it's fucking December. Like stop it. You're not getting
*  in by the end of the year. You're not getting in the beginning of 2020. Let's heal up. We got to
*  we want you healthy. He's such a rare, totally selfless person. And he's such a powerful force
*  for good for those people's, the people that live in the Congo and what he's done for them.
*  I mean, I don't know how many wells they've built so far, but they've made an alliance with the
*  cash app, which is one of my sponsors. So every time someone downloads the cash app, when they
*  use the code Joe Rogan, whether it's for Google, for Android, or for iPhone, for an iPhone, for
*  Apple, you get $10 goes to this cause. So they've raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and they're
*  building wells right now. It's just this amazing thing that he's done. And he's just like, you feel
*  like a piece of shit. Like when you're around him, you're like, why am I not this nice? He's so nice.
*  It's like, it wasn't enough for him to find people who were hard off. He had to go and find the most
*  forgotten, most hard off people on the planet. Right. It's like so many people in Africa have
*  it rough. You're like, no, no, no. Who's got the roughest? The tiny folks that live. And on top of
*  that, the guy's a world-class mixed martial artist. I mean, he really is. He's one of the best heavy
*  weights in the world. And how much better would he be if he was selfish and spent all of his time
*  training and not getting malaria three times, not having this unknown parasite that they think might
*  be in his fucking brain. I mean, they don't even know what it's, I was just reading this story
*  about some guy who was having seizures and it turns out he had all these worms in his brain.
*  And I'm like, and I was thinking about Justin, it was from uncooked pork from this guy. And Justin,
*  they think the problem with the Congo is it's so remote and you don't get a lot of people
*  that go there and get diseases and then come back. So they might not, they don't even know
*  what this is. It might be something that no one's ever got before and then made it back to Western
*  civilization to be examined. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Wow. What the hell, man. Yeah. And you would never
*  know talking to him. No, he just doesn't want to talk about it. Yeah. Let's talk about his friend.
*  Hey, you got to get my friend on the podcast. He's really sweet. He's a great guy. He makes kites.
*  Like what? What the fuck are you talking about? Each kite is going to generate X amount of dollars.
*  Or no. You need a bottle of Justin Ren and feed it to everyone, I guess. Well, you know,
*  it's an interesting, not just an interesting, it's a, it's a, a beautiful sort of expression
*  of what can happen to a person when they experience deep pain and sadness and then they find a way out
*  and then they find a way to help other people. And that's sort of what he's done. You know,
*  his childhood was really rough and he came out of that a super kind person as opposed to being
*  angry and mean. I mean, this is what we need more in the world, right? We need more people building
*  people up and helping and less people tearing people down and hating. I mean, so much of,
*  so much of what social media is used for and so much of what the internet is used for is hate,
*  is anger. There's so much anger, you know, and to see someone like Justin, this rare soul that has
*  found a way to almost universal. I mean, like everything he does is channeled towards good,
*  all of it, you know, including kicking people's asses, which is like, how do you make that good?
*  You found it. You found a way to make kicking people's asses a good thing. It's beautiful.
*  I'm really honored to be his friend. So he's one of my, you know, the rarest people that I know.
*  Yeah, no doubt. No, it's been cool to hear his story and, you know, I think, thanks to you,
*  he's probably got a much bigger audience too. So, um,
*  So what are you thinking about in terms of the timeline?
*  Well, so if, if I go and try to get close to or right around the record for that, it's,
*  you know, about a 40 day ish timeframe, give or take. So you're really, I think the biggest
*  hurdle or planning thing is to find the timeline where you're going to run into the least amount
*  of weather issues because you're going across the country. So you're going over the Sierras
*  and you're going through the, you know, the middle of the country and then all that stuff. So
*  obviously you don't want to be going over mountain passes in the middle of winter,
*  which you probably don't also want to be going through the Midwest in the middle of the summer.
*  So some of us can be kind of planning around, around that. There's, there's probably like some
*  good opportunities in the spring and the fall that kind of catch that window of moderate temps
*  versus extremes. What's the gentleman that did it before? Uh, Pete Kostelman. Do you know Pete?
*  Yeah. Yeah. There he is. Man runs from San Francisco to New York in record time. Look at that guy.
*  He's still dazed. Pete's also like, what the fuck did I do? You want to hear something crazy
*  about Pete though? So he did that. And then, uh, that wasn't enough because he, I think this was
*  year ago or two years ago, he went up in Alaska and went from Alaska down to the Southern tip of
*  Florida all by himself with just like one of those push strollers. And he averaged like,
*  I think it was like 50 miles a day or something like that. So yeah, folks, if he went from Alaska
*  to Florida, yeah, yeah. He did a, I forget what they called it. So that's his food. His food's in
*  the stroller. Yeah. Uh huh. He was stuck, bro. You know, it was funny. It was, I, I was kind of
*  following him while he did it. That's so crazy. He's got a baby stroller with food in it. What a crazy
*  idea. He, uh, he did, uh, when I was following him, like, you know, he was logging all his runs
*  on Strava. So it was hilarious to see like these, these weeks after weeks where it's like 50 mile
*  day, 50 mile day, 50 mile day, like, you know, like 350, 400 mile weeks and stuff like that.
*  And then if you like zoomed in on his routes, you could see like he'd be on this route and
*  all of a sudden you see him deviate a little bit and you'd zoom in and be like, oh, there's a
*  grocery store there. That's why he turned right there. To fill up his baby cart with food.
*  Where'd he keep his money? I don't know. I, the baby car probably. Yeah. I'm trying to steal that
*  baby cart. Where'd he sleep? Uh, I think he stayed at hotels if I'm not mistaken. I'd have to, I'd
*  have to look back. So bring the baby cart up the stairs. Yeah. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Uh, there's
*  crazy people out there, man. There's different kinds of humans, right? Like you have this idea
*  of like what a person is capable of and you see someone like that and you go, okay,
*  I gotta rethink this. People are capable of way more. Yeah. Yeah. It's nuts when you think
*  about it. As soon as you think you find limitations, then all of a sudden someone goes out and does,
*  does something crazier or bigger or better. And guy took a baby stroller from Alaska to Florida.
*  What the fuck, man? Um, did you talk to him at all about this idea? I haven't yet. No. I mean,
*  it's been, are you going to? Yeah, I'll definitely reach out to him. He'll, he'll be good about it.
*  I think he's a nice guy. I know Pete. So how many people have done this run? I don't even know.
*  It's been, it's a documented route. So, uh, it's been done, done. You could probably Google it and
*  find out. And, uh, but yeah, it's, it's probably, it's more than you'd think. It just really usually
*  comes down and actually, you know, Justin worked with someone earlier who did it walking. I think,
*  I think maybe it was a slightly different route, uh, but it was basically the same premise. And,
*  uh, he, he walked like some 20 some miles a day or something like that and was raising,
*  raising funds and awareness for Fight for the Forgotten too. So, uh, we'll maybe talk to him
*  a bit too. So, um, the idea is late summer, early fall, something like that. Yeah, that's probably
*  ideal. I think you want to try to catch, uh, you want to get away from winter, but you also want
*  to be done before the worst part of summer. Right. With the global warming, do you factor that in?
*  Depends how fast it ends up coming. The route might be shorter by the time I get around to doing it.
*  If the coast is coming in though. So sometime around this time next year, it should be completed.
*  Is that the idea? Um, maybe my thought is it's probably got to either be about like, you know,
*  a 10 month like start point or 18. So I could either do it now, or I guess it'd be a little
*  less than 18, uh, but by finishing. So I would either maybe try to do it like this fall,
*  or if I don't have enough in place by then target kind of the end of winter for 2021.
*  And what would change? What would make you decide to do it 2021 versus 2020?
*  Uh, just, just, I mean, I'm trying to respect how much like planning it's going to take. And
*  I haven't really started that yet. So I don't want to like necessarily get, find out like, okay,
*  let's say I just put a date on the, on the calendar right away and then find out, oh,
*  I need to like, there's a lot more resources I have to try to acquire to make this happen.
*  And this in terms of logistics, like food, mostly logistics, getting everything just organized
*  enough to, uh, cause I don't want to screw it up. Uh, so there's that too. And then also planning
*  around my own race schedule to a degree too. So, uh, um, obviously this will probably, this will
*  take the place of an, the way I look at, uh, like seasons of racing is just kind of two key ones.
*  You have like your spring, early summer, and you're kind of late summer, fall slash winter
*  seasons. That's kind of two. Uh, so I'll basically just sacrifice one of those seasons for this.
*  And I probably won't, I mean, I don't really know what to expect cause I've never done anything
*  quite like this before, but, um, I'm planning on dedicating one of those seasons towards that
*  exclusively. So Jamie's nodding over here. He's got something digging through this article.
*  Pretty interesting. So it started here, but distance walking was a huge spectator sport.
*  In the late 19th century, they would bet money that like you couldn't do it.
*  For instance, people followed it like it was the world series.
*  So it continued on until the great depression, world war two, probably because people didn't
*  have enough time to waste their time doing this. And then it picked back up in the late 20th
*  century. And that's when you had to prove what you were doing.
*  Look at this. The first known transcontinental journey took place in 1896 by a mother daughter
*  duo who needing to raise money to save their farm in Spokane County, Washington, responded
*  to a $10,000 public wager that no one could make it by foot across the country. Helga and Clara
*  Espy left home with $10 between them, as well as a compass, a knife, a curling iron, and a Smith
*  and Wesson revolver. Don't fuck with those ladies. They'll curl your hair and shoot you in the dick.
*  They made it to New York City seven months later, but for reasons unknown, did not receive any
*  reward for their toils on their way home. Helga and Clara took the train. What the fuck? Why didn't
*  they get paid? Someone fucked them out of their money, probably. Someone fucked them out of their
*  money. Some jackass. Yeah. So it started again, picked that back up again in like the sixties.
*  And in 1980, somebody that was doing it had his team scramble to get witness signatures the whole
*  way across so he could prove that he did it. When he did it and the amount of time that he did it.
*  Yeah. I mean, people cheat on marathons, right? They jump in cars and marathons and make it on
*  the train. There was a guy, I think, before Pete broke the record that I think got caught cheating
*  trying to do it. Cause I mean, you got to document stuff pretty detailed and it's crazy. Like, I mean,
*  you'd think it would be enough just to track it on your watch and upload it. Right. But like,
*  you know, people do goofy things. Like they get in the back of the RV, I guess, and drive really slow.
*  But people who are really good at like looking at those GPX files can look and see like, oh,
*  that's not a run. That's, you know, they can see these variances and paces or consistencies
*  that wouldn't be uniform with running or something like that. Oh, interesting. Well,
*  maybe this should be some sort of a video recording of it. Like if you have a GoPro in your head.
*  I want to do a live feed and just have it on all the- Is that possible? Satellite streaming?
*  Yeah. There's probably a way to do it. But- Yeah, that would be dope. Listen, man, we're in. We'll
*  help you. Whatever we could do. Sounds like a very worthy cause and it's a crazy undertaking.
*  And we'd be happy to promote it too and let everybody know and have people
*  fucking honk their horn and drive by you. We're going to Dairy Queen. See you later, Zach.
*  As long as they want to like hand off a nice ribeye or something.
*  Yeah. What are you going to eat along the way? How are you going to do- What do you like? What
*  kind of food would you consume? Yeah. So kind of maybe go full circle. Well, we started before
*  where we kind of talk about kind of what I periodize with carbohydrates and stuff like that,
*  where I think there is a point where the distance is long enough where like a strict ketogenic diet
*  is maybe more applicable. I think it's very pretty well established. Like if you'd follow a strict
*  ketogenic diet or a zero carb diet and try to perform in some of these typical endurance events,
*  it's going to come at a performance cost unless you have some weird like outlying type situation.
*  And I mean, Trent Stellingworth looked at, he's a guy up in Canada who works with a lot of the
*  sports performance stuff. And he did some studies that actually looks at like, if you do, if you go
*  super strict keto or zero carb, you get really fat adapted. You get really good at burning fat,
*  but it comes at a cost of your ability to burn exogenous glucose. So like if I went zero carb
*  for like a year and then I tried to take in my fueling strategy that I do now, my body would
*  probably reject it. Or at least I would have to be like, like really, really conservative with how
*  much I used. Have you talked to Dom DiAgostino about this stuff? Not personally though. Do you
*  know him? Yeah, I know, I know I follow him and stuff. I'm actually going to be presenting at his
*  metabolic health summit in, I believe it's in end of January, early February. He's a very,
*  very interesting guy because he's a super legit fact-based scientist who's also a power athlete,
*  and ketogenic like for a long, long time now. Try to get him on board for this attempt. But like
*  what I'm trying to say with that is like, he'd probably help you. Yeah. I mean, he'd be a great
*  resource for sure. But like for something like this, like my intensity is going to be so low
*  that like I don't technically need to be taking in exogenous glucose for something like that.
*  So it might actually behoove me to be as fat adapted as I can get versus what I'm normally
*  doing is I'm trying to get as fat adapted as I need to be, but not necessarily so far that
*  it comes at the compromise of being able to do my in-race nutrition fueling plan. I was always
*  into the impression that your body always knows what to do with glucose, but that it has to be
*  fat adapted. So that's not the case necessarily. I think you probably can to a degree, but what
*  happens is like you down-regulate, like I can't speak to the science perfectly, but Trent
*  Stallinworth did a bunch of research where it basically it down-regulates the mechanism that
*  allows you to take in glucose and utilize it in a meaningful way. So like, you know, most people
*  can tolerate probably somewhere between maybe 60 to 90 grams of glucose per hour during some of
*  these events. Whereas like if you went on a strict zero carb diet and try to do 60 to 90 grams of
*  sports drink or fuel or something like that, like I don't think your body could clear it because it
*  would have down-regulated your body's capability to do that. So I mean, folks who are interested
*  should look at Trent Stallinworth's work. He would be able to describe it in much better detail
*  than I can. So you would just go on a real super heavy fat diet? I think so. That's what I'm
*  thinking about. I wouldn't necessarily- Just avocados, coconut oil, meat. Yeah, just mainline
*  those F bombs. Yeah, just get as much fat as your body can. I think a lot of fat and a lot of protein
*  would be the name of the game for something that that's that low and that slow intensity.
*  And you would try for how many miles a day? Well, Pete did it in 70. So I feel like it would be
*  cool to try to challenge his attempt. But who knows? How many hours was he doing a day?
*  I don't know. That's a good question. I'd have to look back and see what he was doing. I don't know
*  if it was consistently the same every day. So maybe that's where my plan would deviate. And I
*  probably am going to learn along the way and maybe change things. But I do kind of like, at least on
*  paper, that idea of targeting a 12 to 14 hour window so that I have at least 10 hours to kind
*  of like refuel and sleep and stay on top of that stuff. And what that'll likely mean is like,
*  maybe there'll be some days where I go well past 70 miles. Maybe there'll be some days where I go
*  well under. And you just hope that you average to get the record. But the record is kind of
*  secondary. I'm going to stick- If I fall off, if it's clear when I get to the Midwest that I'm not
*  going to hit Pete's record, we're going to just try to keep the main goal in mind of bringing
*  awareness to fight for the forgotten. Beautiful. Well, listen, we're in. You let us know. We'll help
*  you. We'll pump it up. We'll sponsor you. Whatever we need to do. Let's make it happen. Awesome,
*  man. Thank you. Thanks, Zach. Thanks for being here. Yeah. Hey, do you mind if I share my social
*  media real quick? Please. I was just going to ask you that. Oh, cool. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt
*  you. No, please. Yeah. I mean, you can find me on my website at ZachBitter, Z-A-C-H-B-I-T-T-E-R.com.
*  Social media is Instagram at ZachBitter and Twitter at ZBitter. All that stuff can be
*  found on my website though. ZachBitter, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks, brother. Appreciate it, man.
*  Awesome. Thanks, everyone. See you soon. Bye.
