# Joe Rogan Experience #1514 - Joe De Sena
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCSDF0RNuXY)
*  Thanks for doing this. My pleasure. Hello Joe. How are you? We're rolling. What's going on man? Nice to meet you. Thanks for having me.
*  So the kettlebell, you bring this fucking thing everywhere you go. Literally everywhere? I do. I lived overseas and I started it.
*  You know why I started it? I had a 696 pound guy come to the farm six years ago and he wanted to help losing weight.
*  And I helped him over 18 months get down to 265 pounds. Wow. And one of the methods I used to motivate him was I said,
*  As you lose weight, I'll carry weight. And eventually I was carrying a 100 pound sandbag. Fast forward and we can get into it.
*  I moved overseas with my family and I tried to carry that 100 pound sandbag because I had made that commitment to them.
*  And they wouldn't let it through TSA. So when I landed in Asia, I asked my wife, I said, hey, could you order a 20 pound, it's stupid that I'm carrying a sandbag.
*  Can you order a 20 pound kettlebell? I'll just carry a 20 pound around so I'm not a complete fraud.
*  And she confused pounds with kilograms and I ended up with a 44 pounder and it just became my shtick, my thing.
*  So when you say you carry it everywhere, you go everywhere with it. I go everywhere with it.
*  So during the pandemic, I haven't, I wouldn't carry it if we were going to a grocery store.
*  But if I'm traveling to see you or I'm going anywhere in the world, kettlebells come with me, Vegas, anywhere.
*  Do you take it as a carry on?
*  It depends on the country. We operate in a lot of countries and every country treats it differently.
*  So some US flights, they'll let me carry it on, which is strange. Others, they asked me to check it.
*  You know, they won't let you bring a pool cue on a plane.
*  Yeah, they say it's like a weapon. Well, how is that not like a weapon?
*  Well, my answer to them is you'd have to be pretty fucking strong.
*  You're pretty fucking strong. You could smash somebody with one of those things.
*  No, but they've let me bring it on planes. China doesn't mind at all.
*  India, in India, you're going to love this. They asked me to put it in someone else's luggage.
*  So in other words, somebody had just dropped off their luggage. I'm checking the kettlebell.
*  Stick it in that blue suitcase. Get it when you get to the other end.
*  You don't even know who the person is?
*  I don't even know who the person is.
*  Oh, that's insane.
*  So I get there and I have to explain to this person in India why I'm opening their suitcase to get my kettlebell.
*  Do they speak English, the person you're speaking to?
*  This particular case, no.
*  So what did they say when you pulled a fucking kettlebell out?
*  They were confused. They don't know. But if you act with authority, they just assume maybe I work for the airline or who knows.
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious. That's so ridiculous. That's that standard behavior in India?
*  Well, uh...
*  How many times have you been over there?
*  I've been to India twice. It's happened twice in India.
*  Same thing?
*  Same thing.
*  Put it in somebody else's bag.
*  Somebody else's bag. In the Middle East, they give me a sentence which I can't recall, but it basically says it's going to be up to God if this comes out the other end.
*  Really?
*  For real. They've lost a dozen of them in the United States. In the United States, once, you're going to love this.
*  I get to JFK and there are two stories in the baggage claim.
*  So I go to the large luggage area because I'm hoping that's where the kettlebell is where it should be.
*  But I hear some noise on the conveyor belt above me.
*  Sure enough, the fucking kettlebell comes flying down the steep ramp.
*  Oh my God.
*  Almost takes out a TSA, you know, a customs officer.
*  Dents all, I'm embarrassed to say, dents all the stainless steel, right?
*  But I walk over embarrassed, pick up the kettlebell and walk out.
*  I bought a bowling ball bag.
*  That's what I need.
*  Like with a roller on it.
*  I bought one of those for a kettlebell, but I was like, what am I doing?
*  I stopped. I stopped. It's just too much of a pain in the ass because I don't like to check luggage.
*  I don't like to check luggage.
*  I like to carry my shit.
*  I like to carry it. Japan, the woman will wrap it perfectly as if it's like a dive of chocolate.
*  Wrap it and cardboard, tape it, put a little handle and then in high heel shoes,
*  she'll carry it a hundred yards like she's sweating and carefully place it in location.
*  So they're very detail oriented.
*  That's a different culture over there.
*  Different culture.
*  Yeah.
*  They have like one of the lowest death rates and lowest problems with COVID.
*  Like they're one of the countries that handled it the best.
*  And we're trying to figure out why.
*  And I think it's probably they're really good at following rules, very disciplined.
*  They wear masks all the time when they're sick.
*  They were. So I lived there for a year.
*  And during COVID, I put together this phone call that happened every morning.
*  I called it the warrior call 527 a.m.
*  And I had all our teams from 40 plus countries get on the call.
*  Thirty minutes. Give me an update from Japan.
*  Give me an update from China. Give me an update from France.
*  I mean, they did not fuck about.
*  And you know, they're not shaking hands in Japan.
*  Right. They've got the bow.
*  Taxi drivers are wearing gloves.
*  They don't mess around.
*  So no surprise that they killed it right away.
*  It's so interesting how human beings that, you know,
*  basically not much different other than they're from a different climate,
*  you know, different genes.
*  But it's just amazing how differently they live.
*  It's it's a very different culture.
*  It's amazing how they all have like when I was in Japan,
*  I've only been once.
*  But when I was in Tokyo, I was like, everyone is so polite.
*  Like you're walking down the street and it's like there's no garbage anywhere.
*  It's very clean. But yes, yet it's very packed.
*  There's a lot of people and everyone is very friendly.
*  Like it's like the way they handle everything.
*  Everything is very polite, very orderly.
*  One thing I found interesting,
*  I couldn't go to the gym unless I went back to my hotel room and I was like,
*  I'm not going to the gym unless I went back to my hotel room and put a long sleeve shirt on.
*  No tattoos.
*  Yeah, they wouldn't let me out.
*  I'm like, I'm not your cousin.
*  You're a mafia.
*  You're a mafia.
*  Yeah, they wouldn't let me show.
*  You cannot have any visible tattoos,
*  at least in the gym that I was working out at.
*  No, it's everywhere.
*  And, you know, there's simple little things they did to affect human behavior.
*  Like we couldn't find garbage cans on the street like you would in New York or somewhere else.
*  You're putting yourself in a situation where you can't dispose of the garbage, right?
*  So now you're sticking it in your pocket.
*  So within a month, you're not creating garbage anymore because it's a pain in the ass, right?
*  You're figuring out how to use less and get rid of less.
*  So they've changed behavior.
*  Subways are spotless.
*  Yeah, I didn't watch, I didn't actually get on any of the Subways, but everything was spotless.
*  It was weird.
*  And people are thin.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  They smoke a little too much.
*  They smoke a lot.
*  They drink a lot too, which is weird.
*  They drink a lot.
*  But they don't really get fat.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Very unusual culture.
*  And if you follow back to the warrior culture, the samurai, and their long history of martial arts,
*  it's really kind of amazing that this island had so much innovation and so much mastery of hand-to-hand combat,
*  of swordsmanship, of sword making.
*  I mean, it's pretty incredible culture.
*  They're the Germans, we like to say, of Asia.
*  Ah, that's a good way of putting it.
*  They are tight.
*  Yeah.
*  So what were you doing over there?
*  Why were you there for a year?
*  So after I helped that guy lose that weight, the company-
*  How did you do that, by the way?
*  He lost 400 pounds?
*  Yeah.
*  Close to it?
*  Close to it.
*  In a year?
*  18 months.
*  That's amazing.
*  It was amazing.
*  You're not going to be, we may be at odds on this, but I went, and I'll tell you why,
*  we went raw fruits and vegetables only, and here's a guy that was eating eight egg McMuffins a day for breakfast
*  and two two-liter Sprites.
*  Geez.
*  Right? So he gets, he balloons to 696 pounds.
*  How long did it take him to get that big?
*  To get back to-
*  No, as big as he was.
*  Oh, you know-
*  Was he always big?
*  Yeah, when he left, he said, he was crying, he said to me,
*  this is the first time, as far as I can remember, where I fit in one airplane seat.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So this was over a long period of time.
*  But he, we did raw fruits and vegetables, and then we did, we started with a 10-mile hike every day.
*  10 miles every day?
*  Every day, and then it went to 20.
*  It went to 10 in the morning, 10 at night, raw fruits and vegetables.
*  We got to a point where he was losing two to three pounds a day.
*  That 10 in 10, that's a long hike in a lot of time.
*  Like, how much time was that taking him every day?
*  He gave up work, he worked for Comcast, they were kind enough to say, you're on leave,
*  I covered the expenses, which was like two stalks of celery and a glass of water every day.
*  It wasn't much of an expense.
*  And he spent the whole day, basically, hiking.
*  So he hiked all day, and what kept him motivated?
*  Just this idea that he was going to lose weight at the other end?
*  I took his keys, I took his wallet, and he had no plan.
*  Like, what was he going to do? How was he going to get out?
*  Where was this?
*  We have a farm in Vermont, so we basically had him on lock and key.
*  How did you know this guy before this?
*  I got a phone call that somebody had just finished one of our Spartan events
*  that was extremely overweight and showed me the photo.
*  And I said, get in touch with this guy right away.
*  This is our Jared. This is our subway star.
*  You don't want to say Jared now.
*  That's right. You remember.
*  So I got in touch with him and he said, game on.
*  Wow. That's amazing.
*  So he completed the race at 600 pounds?
*  He was tricked. He was told that it was a 5K walk.
*  So normally that 5K Spartan would take, let's say, 90 minutes for the average person.
*  He took seven hours.
*  So tricked into it, fought through it, probably would have never come back.
*  But then I found out about him, called him and said,
*  hey, you're invited to the farm. I want to help you.
*  We documented it. We actually filmed it.
*  Wow. So you didn't know this guy at all before this?
*  Didn't know him.
*  That's incredible. So you just looked at it as, okay, this is a project.
*  Yeah, I tend to, I like broken wingers.
*  I like helping folks that, you know, I had, I grew up in Queens in Howard Beach
*  and it was for whatever reason organized crime capital of the world.
*  And this is going to sound crazy, but my neighbor was one of the big bosses.
*  And one day when I was pre-teens, he said to me, you know, the best thing we could do on this earth.
*  I said, why? He said, help people.
*  He's the guy that killed people for a living.
*  And because that was his perspective was he was a protector, right?
*  He would help people even though from the outside we know what they really do.
*  But it stuck with me. You got to help people.
*  So this was one of those people I helped.
*  Isn't it crazy that sometimes even people that are just, you would look at them,
*  they're like, they're bad people. They have some good advice.
*  Like even morons can occasionally say something like, huh, all right.
*  I got that.
*  You know, like every now and then, like even a real fool will say something
*  that makes a whole lot of sense.
*  He changed my life. This guy, he, he, he said to me, my parents were going through a divorce.
*  I'm 12 years old and he, he wants to help me.
*  So he says, come over. You're going to clean our swimming pool for us.
*  I don't pay you $35 a week.
*  So I come over on Saturday morning. He says, all right, the first lesson, sit me down for lessons.
*  First lesson is if you're going to come at 8 a.m., you show up 7 45.
*  Right on time is late.
*  Great lesson for life.
*  Second lesson is if I'm paying you to clean the pool, I want you to straighten up the shed,
*  straighten up all the lawn furniture, clean the windows, do whatever the fuck you have to do,
*  but make it so that when I get home, I can't live without you.
*  You are irreplaceable as far as a service provider.
*  And number three, never ask for money.
*  You'll get paid if you do a good job.
*  And it just stuck with me for life.
*  And really, really good lessons from an, like you say, like a most unlikely source of advice.
*  Well, you know, not all mob people are bad people.
*  That sounds like a crazy thing to say, but, you know, I've known quite a few of them in my life
*  and some of them were genuinely good guys.
*  They were just in a fucked up line of work.
*  A fucked up line of work.
*  Well, you know, a lot of them thought of themselves as soldiers.
*  You know, they really did. They thought of themselves as soldiers in an ancient war that, you know,
*  we're not going to understand.
*  You know, we're not talking about people that are, you know, shaking people down for money.
*  I'm talking about, you know, people who were doing work for other organized crime.
*  And they looked at the government as criminals as well.
*  They were like, they're all criminals.
*  Wall Street, you don't think they're fucking criminals?
*  That was the exact, as a young person growing up in that,
*  that was the exact narrative I heard as I was being indoctrinated.
*  Yeah.
*  That the government was just as bad. They killed people.
*  These guys is what they were saying to me.
*  Wall Street does it with a pen.
*  What the fuck are you looking at?
*  Cops plan evidence.
*  Yeah.
*  So, so, um...
*  I'm not defending them.
*  No, but that was their...
*  It's good that the mob's not around, but they did a great job with Vegas.
*  They did a good job with Vegas.
*  They ran Vegas very nice.
*  This guy ended up giving me 700 customers by the time I graduated college that were...
*  Oh, so you had a whole pool cleaning business by then?
*  I had a giant business, Knock on Wood, that were mostly connected to...
*  And I became friends with all these guys.
*  Wow.
*  And could just go on anybody's... It was pretty unbelievable.
*  It's pretty surreal thinking back.
*  And I wanted, I want, like, who wouldn't want to be that?
*  You're a young kid. You're in this neighborhood.
*  They got money, respect, beautiful cars.
*  Like, I want to be that.
*  That's the problem with that and, you know,
*  with young kids growing up around gang members or drug dealers,
*  like, you look at that and you're like,
*  they have things that I don't have and they live this life,
*  they get respect from people, they're feared.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it looks attractive.
*  And one of the bosses' wives said to me one day,
*  because I was alluding to, like, how do I get my...
*  Make my bones?
*  And she said, I had red hair, light skin, everybody else had dark hair, dark skin.
*  And this isn't for you.
*  This isn't for you. You stick with cleaning pools.
*  This is from the wife.
*  Oh, good for her.
*  One of the bosses. So, yeah, that kind of set me straight.
*  So this guy, you find this guy, he's 600 plus pounds.
*  You whittle him down to, what did you say, 260?
*  265.
*  He's a big fella already, must be, right?
*  Yeah, you got to see that.
*  I probably could find the photo of the pants that he wore coming in
*  versus the pants he left with.
*  I mean, you could fit three people in a pair of pants.
*  How did you organize his diet?
*  So I didn't tell you.
*  When I was a kid, on one hand was raviolis, ghanolis, and guns.
*  On the other hand, my mom got into yoga, meditation, health food.
*  She was like Bohemian, crunchy.
*  So while you were working for the mom, your mom was a yoga?
*  My mom had monks in the living room.
*  Very embarrassing.
*  And the reason that happened was because her mom died of cancer,
*  and she walked into a health food store to kind of figure things out.
*  This is like in the 70s.
*  It's probably one health food store in New York at the time.
*  There's no yoga journals, no Whole Foods.
*  People don't even know what a health food store is now.
*  When you say health food store, they'll look at you like,
*  what are you talking about? Health food?
*  There was incense burning. That's exactly right.
*  So she walks in.
*  There happens to be an elderly yogi that just landed in JFK from India
*  in the health food store.
*  She strikes up a conversation with this yogi, changes her whole life, right?
*  Comes home, throws away sausage, peppers, eggplant, parts, all out of the house.
*  Parents get divorced for obvious reasons.
*  She's going to go in a different direction.
*  And I am trying my best for the next 10 years to have my friends not come over
*  because I'm embarrassed, right?
*  There's like Indian pictures on the wall.
*  There's beads. There's chanting.
*  There's monks.
*  And I want to be a gangster.
*  And so, yeah, so anyway, so she maybe through just repetition
*  would just instill this idea that you got to eat healthy.
*  You know, you got to get on raw foods. We're going to go vegan.
*  All the things that are somewhat popular now.
*  And you got to do yoga.
*  And you got to sweat every day.
*  Cold showers way before Wim Hof.
*  Like she was into the cold showers.
*  Really?
*  Oh my God. This was like proper food combining.
*  This idea of intermittent fasting.
*  My mom fasted for 30 days.
*  Okay? This is back in the 70s.
*  While meditating.
*  So anyway.
*  What was that like? You were at home while she was doing that?
*  Yeah. My grandfather, her father had to come to the house
*  and rip her out of the room because he thought she was going to die.
*  Like she was getting thin.
*  She was sitting meditating.
*  She was pretty extreme.
*  And so I had to balance these two things.
*  And so, yeah, I guess what I do now is a little tough guy, a little yoga.
*  I guess that's what it is.
*  But this guy's diet.
*  Yeah. So it came from my mom.
*  But you're dealing with a man who obviously has an extreme health condition.
*  He's morbidly obese.
*  Like how do you know how many calories to give him?
*  What's healthy? What's safe?
*  Like how do you know how to proceed there?
*  So if there's doctors listening, they're probably going to say that I'm crazy.
*  But, and then I'll answer the question more succinctly.
*  Mom introduced me to a guy named Dr. Fred Bishi.
*  You could look him up.
*  He's 92 now.
*  He decides 55 years ago that he's only going to eat raw fruits and vegetables.
*  That's it.
*  There's an Italian guy that was a weightlifter.
*  He's only going to eat raw fruits and veggies.
*  And he's going to test on himself like a guinea pig, does it work or doesn't it work?
*  Is this the best diet or not?
*  I'm just going to test it on myself, he says.
*  And what he finds is that he feels better, all the things that people agree or don't agree with.
*  So I wasn't necessarily knowing that and meeting Dr. Bishi and seeing my mom.
*  I wasn't necessarily into like how many calories it was just like if you eat good healthy food,
*  less ultra processed food, you're not going to starve yourself.
*  Eat what you need. You could eat 40 salads.
*  I don't really care. Where's my message to the guy?
*  But you're not going to.
*  You get tired of salad, right?
*  Once you're tired of salad, then you want the other thing.
*  Then you want to go have a cookie.
*  But if you only eat salad, you're never going to overeat salad.
*  So all he's eating is fruits and salads.
*  Fruits and veggies, that's it.
*  Just everything raw?
*  Everything raw, not cooked.
*  Because the theory was if you cook it, you kill it.
*  And I don't know how many months into it we are, but he's probably down to 350 pounds, 400 pounds.
*  And he says to me, I got to go to the doctor.
*  And I said, what are you talking about?
*  I got to get my liver levels checked.
*  You're not a doctor.
*  I'm really worried. You got me on this ridiculous diet.
*  And I looked at him and I said, you stupid motherfucker.
*  I said, you were eating eight egg McMuffins every day and drinking two two liter sprites.
*  How many times did you get your liver levels checked when you were doing that?
*  You're worried about eating fruits and vegetables that that's fucking up your liver?
*  Anyway, I talked him out of it.
*  And he stuck it out.
*  But we would have battles like that.
*  Sure, he was in agony.
*  Oh, pain. Serious pain.
*  Losing that much body.
*  Well, your body's probably freaking the fuck out.
*  Like, we can't do this.
*  I mean, think of sustainable.
*  This is like a 300.
*  This is a 720 degree turn for him from from what he was.
*  Did you ever hear about that guy?
*  We brought it up a few times.
*  Was it in the 60s?
*  Jamie, the guy who he fasted for a whole year.
*  He did just vitamin drips and he was enormously obese.
*  And he just did vitamin drips and fasted for a whole year.
*  But the crazy thing about it was he didn't get stretched out.
*  His body absorbed the skin.
*  I mean, maybe it's just his personal genetics.
*  You know, like some women, they get pregnant, they have massive stretch marks.
*  Other women, they snap right back like a rubber band.
*  It's there's no rhyme or reason.
*  It seems to be genetic.
*  But this man who was really fat, he lost all this weight, but he lost it everywhere.
*  Like his skin came back normal sized.
*  He didn't have to have any of his skin removed.
*  I would I would bet if it wasn't genetic and unique to him, I've done very long distance races where we had limited food.
*  And I've read about people that have been stuck at sea, let's say for 72 days and their teeth get extremely white and their skin get, you know, if they're not getting sunburned, gets beautiful.
*  I think I think I'm speculating I'm not a doctor.
*  Your body eats any excess.
*  So that I'm making that up.
*  I don't know if that's right.
*  I think that might be it.
*  Because I mean, if you if obviously we're both morons.
*  But if you think about this guy's skin, that's the thing that always happened.
*  I mean, I've had friends that lost a ton of weight and they would have these big flaps of skin.
*  He had it and they wanted to get it removed.
*  But this guy didn't.
*  This guy, his whole body shrunk.
*  Was this Dom DiAgostino told us about this or was this someone?
*  I recall I heard but I'm looking for pictures to see.
*  I heard about it.
*  Yeah, I heard about it.
*  But that was the fascinating part of the story to me was like, whoa, like this guy, not only did he live off of his fat and IV vitamin drips.
*  That's what he took for a whole year.
*  So he lived off of his fat.
*  His body had, you know, hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fat to lose.
*  He lost it all.
*  But that his skin shrank was fascinating to me.
*  I'm like, man, if we could convince people to try that.
*  But again, I don't know if that's the healthiest way to do it.
*  I mean, what kind of long term damage you're doing, if any.
*  So I'm a believer, again, no scientific.
*  I go back to like ancient times and I say to myself, we never had an abundance of food.
*  You and I couldn't walk into a grocery store and have access to if we had food, we had food.
*  And so I would think our stomachs and our digestive system needs time.
*  It's not used to just constantly taking food on demand.
*  Wake up, coffee, doughnut.
*  I don't think our stomachs are made for that.
*  So I don't know about fasting for a whole year.
*  That's a different, right.
*  But also you have to get to that crazy state to be able to do that.
*  You've already abused your body to the point where you're hundreds and hundreds of pounds overweight.
*  That's not normal anyway.
*  That's tough.
*  That doesn't even like you want to go back to hunters and gatherers.
*  That wasn't even possible.
*  No, no.
*  No, they wouldn't have been able to do that.
*  And he was probably laying in a bed and probably not very active.
*  Right, probably.
*  Yeah.
*  So this guy, you just say you're just going to eat as much salad as you want and as much fruit as you want.
*  But that's it.
*  That's it.
*  And just by doing that on these long walks.
*  And how long are these walks taken?
*  You're doing 10 mile hike.
*  Well, in the beginning, as you could imagine, those were really long hikes.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And he was probably, you know, two miles an hour, so five hours to get that done.
*  But as he lost weight and he got more fit, he hustled.
*  And on the farm, on our farm in Vermont, it's hilly.
*  So I could either send them through the fields, which we did in the beginning.
*  But eventually now he's climbing mountains too.
*  And then I started adding weight.
*  Now he's got to carry a little 10 pound sandbag and a 20 pound sandbag.
*  So we just kept upping the ante as his body adapted to what we were doing to him.
*  And he just kept, boom, kept taking off weight.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And so after 18 months, did you let him have a cake?
*  No, did not let him have a cake.
*  But I'll tell you what, somebody heard about what I did.
*  And this guy shows up, number two, we'll call him.
*  And he's 300 pounds and he wants to get to 200.
*  And I said, all right, head up the mountain.
*  You're going to sleep in the cabin because I just went through all that time with the other guy.
*  And we're going to be much more efficient here.
*  First week, you're only eating apples and clean out your system.
*  I gave him a giant bushel of apples, put them on top of the mountain.
*  30 days, we had him down to 200 pounds.
*  And what?
*  30 days, 100 pounds and 30 days.
*  That seems scary.
*  Scary hiking, raw fruits and vegetables.
*  And here's a guy that was set in Terry, a truck driver, not really moving around much, eating shit foods.
*  I mean, it's not rocket science, right?
*  You eat shit food, you're not active, you're gaining weight.
*  You eat good food, you're very active.
*  You lose weight.
*  And his girlfriend picks him up after 30 days and they fucking leave the farm, unbeknownst to me, and they go straight to Ben and Jerry's.
*  And he put on like 18 fucking pounds in a day.
*  So, I mean, there's psychological issues that I, that's not what I'm fixing.
*  I'm doing the physical part.
*  Well, I got to think that a person willing to do 18 months, is that what you said with that gentleman?
*  He hung in for a while.
*  He hung in for a while.
*  The 18 months is just psychologically you're building up some pretty spectacular endurance.
*  Just raw fruits and vegetables for 18 months and hiking 20 hours a day.
*  I mean, you're putting some miles on your mind there.
*  I mean, that's strengthening that muscle of discipline in a way that he probably had never done in his whole life.
*  He got tough.
*  He finished a big event with us.
*  That was like the big moment for him at the end.
*  And got in a single seat in an airplane when he left.
*  Got a girlfriend.
*  Like stuff started to come together for him.
*  So does he maintain?
*  He was at 265 at our best.
*  And my latest understanding is 350.
*  He bounced back.
*  Oh, that's not good.
*  Better than 696.
*  Yeah, but 100 leads to 200.
*  What did he do differently?
*  I mean, you come off the raw fruits and veggies and you stop walking 20 miles a day.
*  Slip a cake in here and there.
*  Yeah.
*  That's got to suck though.
*  Like you get them down to like this really amazing weight.
*  You got to, I mean, what am I going to do?
*  I can't keep all these people on the farm.
*  There's nothing you can do.
*  No, but still.
*  You get them there and then they got to fly.
*  They got to do it.
*  Yeah, it sucks that you got that far.
*  And then you see them put 100 pounds.
*  How long did it take them to put 100 pounds on?
*  I'm sure it was 90, 100 days.
*  But they snap back.
*  I mean, it's that pendulum swing, right?
*  Like, oh my God, I get regular food now.
*  I don't have to hike as much anymore.
*  I mean, I'm a believer.
*  I don't know if you are.
*  I'm a believer.
*  The number one motivator for human beings is the avoidance of discomfort, right?
*  Because if we didn't avoid discomfort, we'd freeze in the snow.
*  We'd fall off a cliff.
*  We'd get in cold.
*  So we're always constantly, even subconsciously, avoiding discomfort.
*  And to be healthy, you got to be uncomfortable.
*  You got to train.
*  You got to eat health.
*  Those are hard things to do.
*  Go to bed early, not drink as much.
*  And so unless somebody is holding you accountable or unless you're like, obviously you're a high performer.
*  I'm a bit of a maniac in that, like I'm more uncomfortable if I'm not optimal, if I'm not being my best.
*  Right.
*  But most people, that's not the case.
*  No, you have to kind of make your mind into your mind has to seek discomfort.
*  It has to seek these difficult tasks.
*  You have to enjoy it.
*  And you have to figure out a way to make your mind enjoy those things.
*  And some people comes easy and some people doesn't.
*  Some people, some people takes a long time.
*  I always tell people the best thing you could ever do is force yourself to a schedule.
*  Just write it down.
*  Today I have to do an hour on the treadmill.
*  I have to do an hour no matter what.
*  Even if you're fucking walking on it, you're doing an hour on a treadmill.
*  The next time you're going to do it, just make, okay, you did an hour and this is the amount of miles you got in.
*  Next time you're going to add three miles.
*  Put an extra three miles in that one hour.
*  And just keep doing things like that.
*  Write down, today I'm going to do 100 pushups and I'm going to do 100 sit ups and I'm going to do 100 chin ups.
*  That's today.
*  And then force yourself.
*  Force yourself to adhere to a schedule.
*  Make a Monday, Wednesday, Friday workout schedule.
*  Give yourself some time off.
*  Don't even crush yourself to the point where you can't do it.
*  Make it so that you really appreciate those Tuesdays and Thursdays.
*  But on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, you're going to fucking get after it and this is what you're going to do.
*  Most people just try to go work out.
*  And you're kind of aimless and you show up and you pick up the jump rope and you jump a little rope.
*  Maybe you hit the heavy bag a little bit.
*  Maybe you do some curls.
*  But you don't really have an aim.
*  That's why people like to hire trainers because a trainer will tell you what to do.
*  Well, you can tell yourself what to do if you don't have money for a trainer.
*  You don't even have to have fucking equipment.
*  You know, with bodyweight squats, sit ups, chin ups, push ups, you can kick your fucking ass.
*  You could give yourself a brutal full bodyweight workout and you could find these for free on YouTube.
*  There's a ton of them.
*  There's a ton of these bodyweight workouts you could do.
*  Just force yourself.
*  Write it down.
*  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
*  I'm going to do 100 pushups.
*  I'm going to do 100 chin ups.
*  I'm going to do 100 sit ups.
*  Even if it takes me all fucking day, even if I have to do 10 and 10 and 10 and keep going all day, just that's what you do.
*  Do 10 pushups, take a break for 20 minutes, do another 10.
*  But get those 100 in.
*  Here's a question I have for you.
*  I agree with you 100 percent.
*  Bodyweight and discipline.
*  Yeah.
*  But you were a fighter.
*  Tell me if you agree with this.
*  In the 70s, I remember as a young kid seeing Rocky.
*  Yeah.
*  That was my introduction to, for many kids actually in America, that was our introduction to fighting.
*  And for whatever reason, at a very young age, it was intriguing to me that a person, a fighter, would get out of shape and then get in shape.
*  Yeah.
*  Why wouldn't they just stay in shape the whole time?
*  Yeah.
*  It's a discipline issue.
*  It's also like a lot of fighters are wild people.
*  You know, one of the things that fuels them is not just this desire to compete.
*  They're wild.
*  They like to get fucked up.
*  They like to drink.
*  They like to party.
*  They like to womanize.
*  They like to go out on the town and be the fucking man.
*  You know, and they get fat.
*  Like Roberto Duran was famous for that.
*  Right.
*  He'd get real fat in between fights.
*  And then you'd have to lose weight.
*  And just, you know, that there's guys that don't like Bernard Hopkins never, never gained weight.
*  And he was super disciplined and always ate really clean and was a elite athlete deep into his 40s.
*  I mean, he was a world champion deep into his 40s.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is very unusual for a boxer.
*  And so my question is, is it makes sense why they go in and out and they don't maintain it?
*  But then the very disciplined fighters would perform better, I would imagine, right?
*  Because then, yeah, for the most part, yeah.
*  Do you think, because this is the way I call it the Spartan paradox, right?
*  And you probably have a better name for it from all the years of fighting.
*  But like, if you have a date on the calendar, the Spartans knew they're going to battle.
*  If you know you got a fight coming up, you'll do those pushups, those squats, right?
*  And those crunches.
*  Some guys will.
*  But if you know you got a battle coming.
*  Okay, I'll give you an example.
*  Andy Ruiz.
*  Okay.
*  Andy Ruiz, he comes in last minute, knocks out Anthony Joshua, becomes the heavyweight champion of the world.
*  First Mexican heavyweight champion of the world.
*  He's a fucking hero.
*  Gets fat as fuck, balloons up to 280.
*  This is while training for the next fight.
*  Weighs in at 280.
*  Loses the rematch.
*  Knows it was coming.
*  Got rid of his trainer, had all sorts of fucking problems in camp, partied too much.
*  Knew it was coming.
*  Knew the date was coming.
*  Wouldn't do the work.
*  Wouldn't do the work.
*  Just was living the lifestyle.
*  Just got too wrapped up in the fact that he was the champ and too wrapped up in partying.
*  And next thing you know, he lost the title.
*  And now, you know, he's faced with this very difficult task of trying to get a fight for the title now.
*  Because he's a dangerous fighter still.
*  But people, he's not really the draw that he could have been.
*  If he had beat Joshua the second time, he's a superstar.
*  He's up there with Tyson Fury.
*  You got cocky.
*  Well, whatever it was, man.
*  He got lost in the lifestyle.
*  The lifestyle gets a lot of these guys.
*  You're hanging out with a lot of your buddies that you came up with.
*  Maybe you got a buddy who drives you around.
*  Maybe you got another buddy who does security.
*  And they like to party.
*  And there's girls.
*  And there's maybe a little bit of cocaine.
*  A little bit of alcohol.
*  Next thing you know, you're fat again.
*  And this is, it's real common.
*  It's real common.
*  Would you say, at least I see it in our community, is for the most part, most people, if they know they got something hard coming, they'll wake up a little earlier.
*  It's a good motivator, but some people cram for tests.
*  Some people push it.
*  Like if you tell someone they have a fight in three months, some people start drinking water right now.
*  And they start eating healthy right now.
*  And they write down a schedule.
*  They start monitoring their heart rate.
*  Maybe they get a whoop strap and start checking what their heart rate variability is, make sure they're recovering from their workouts correctly and do it scientifically.
*  Other people go, three months.
*  All right, we're going to party for a month.
*  And then two months, I'm going to get after it.
*  And then two months into it, look, I only need six weeks.
*  Let's go to fucking Cancun.
*  Let's go do this.
*  Let's go.
*  And then they say, I'll be fine.
*  I'll fuck this motherfucker up no matter what.
*  And then come fight time, they know they didn't put in enough work and they're nervous.
*  And so they tuck shit at the weigh-ins.
*  They try to push the guy.
*  They try to fuck with his head.
*  You know, did you see all this insecurity come out?
*  The psychological aspect of fighting is it's a crazy battle.
*  And oftentimes that psychological aspect of it is either reinforced by discipline or the opposite.
*  Like, if you know you don't have any discipline, like, it plays on your psyche and it fucks with you.
*  And it really gives guys tremendous anxiety.
*  There's a lot of very, very talented fighters that, for whatever reason, are just not very disciplined.
*  It's really common.
*  Sometimes the most physically talented guys, it came a little too easy for them.
*  Maybe they have some unique gifts.
*  Maybe they're very fast or maybe they hit very hard.
*  And those things are really kind of genetic, like, especially hitting hard.
*  And you could take a kid who is just starting out and he can hit harder than a guy who has been fighting for 10 years.
*  It's weird.
*  It's just the way you're built.
*  It's just the way you're built.
*  And some guys just have it and some guys will never have it.
*  They could be world champions.
*  They could be fighting 10, 15 years and then retire and never have a real one-punch knockout power.
*  And other guys are born with it.
*  You get a guy first day of the gym.
*  He hits the pads.
*  And like, holy shit.
*  And other guys don't.
*  And some of those guys with the power, sometimes they just fuck off.
*  Sometimes they're not disciplined.
*  Sometimes the guys who don't have the power, they work harder.
*  And they develop a better, more well-rounded skill set to compensate for the fact they don't have that one-punch knockout power.
*  Would you say, I have an opinion, but would you say the athlete, doesn't matter if it's boxing or whatever, right, that has both?
*  That has the genetics and that just...
*  That's a Michael Jordan.
*  That's a Roy Jones Jr.
*  That's a spectacular athlete, but is also super intelligent.
*  Disciplined.
*  You need intelligence, too.
*  People look at intelligence, unfortunately, like book smart.
*  And by book smart, I don't mean someone who's intelligent, who's uneducated, is not capable of being book smart.
*  Because most of them are.
*  But Mike Tyson is a great example.
*  Mike Tyson is a very intelligent guy.
*  And when you talk to him about boxing history, when you talk to him about the history of philosophy, when he starts talking about great warriors and Marcus Aurelius and some of the books that he's read, he's very intelligent.
*  But he's intelligent figuring out how to fuck people up.
*  You can't get that good at heavyweight boxing just on physical talent, which clearly he had, and just on genetics, which also...
*  He was 190 pounds and he was 13.
*  When he was 13, Teddy Atlas told me he took him to these smokers and they wouldn't believe it.
*  They're like, how is that kid?
*  He's like, he's 13.
*  He's like, get the fuck out of here.
*  He's like, OK, 16.
*  And so he put him in there with 16 year olds and he would knock them out cold because he was just incredible.
*  Yes. And he had focus and drive.
*  But those that that perfect unicorn is a person who's obsessed, but also extremely intelligent and gifted.
*  That's the unicorn.
*  That's John Jones.
*  That's Roy Jones Jr.
*  That's Michael Jordan.
*  That's these freaks.
*  You know, that when you see them, you like...
*  Gretzky.
*  Yes. Where they're everything.
*  They have the whole thing.
*  The whole package.
*  They have the passion for the sport.
*  They have this insane dedication and they also have incredible talent.
*  Yeah. So...
*  Those are the goats.
*  Yeah, those are the goats.
*  So I graduate high school and I want to go back to the neighborhood.
*  I don't want to go to college, right?
*  Because for obvious reasons, I want to be around these guys and I got this business that's doing great.
*  And a friend of mine says...
*  Because my mom moved to Ithaca, New York to get me away from the neighborhood when they got divorced.
*  So a friend of mine in Ithaca says, why don't we go to Cornell?
*  Cornell is in Ithaca.
*  And I said, how the fuck would we go to Cornell?
*  My grades suck.
*  I'm not planning on going to college.
*  I got this business.
*  He said, my dad's a professor.
*  He'll get us in.
*  So coming from the neighborhood I came from, that made sense.
*  We got a guy that's going to get us into college.
*  So we both apply.
*  We do great on the application.
*  We do great in the interview.
*  Neither of us get in.
*  But now I'm interested, right?
*  When somebody pushes back and says, no, you're not allowed to come here, now you want in.
*  It wasn't even my intention to go to college, but now I want to go.
*  So...
*  Because they said no, right?
*  So I say to him, and this ties to what you were just saying, I say to him,
*  well, fuck, if we're going to do it, why don't I spend the summer going to St. John's in Queens
*  while I'm doing my pool business and learn how to study?
*  Because I've never studied.
*  Buckle down, get serious, get disciplined.
*  He says, screw that, we're going to go to Vegas.
*  Why don't we go to Vegas, give up your business, go to Vegas, we'll party all summer,
*  and then we'll buckle down in September when we get here.
*  Why would we waste the summer?
*  This is our last summer.
*  So we diverge.
*  And I study and I run my business and he goes to Vegas.
*  And we both come back and we reapply.
*  We do well that semester.
*  We're allowed to go, it's called extramural, allowed to take three classes,
*  non-matriculated in the school, and then apply.
*  We both do it, and they don't accept us.
*  So he diverts, he goes to Vegas, he goes to UNLV.
*  And I stay and I say, fuck this, I'm doing it again.
*  And I do it a second time, I do it a third time, finally fourth time.
*  They accept me and I pound my chest and I tell people this story, right?
*  Look how great I am, I was disciplined unlike him who went to...
*  He became a giant medical marijuana guy in Vegas.
*  And I'm fucking laying barbed wire for a living.
*  So maybe, maybe discipline in that guy, I don't know.
*  Well, you know, sometimes people find a path that suits their personality.
*  Like oftentimes people confuse discipline with focus.
*  And this is why that's important.
*  There are things that some people can excel at because they're focused on them
*  and because they're drawn to it and they have an incredible passion for it.
*  Versus like you tell a guy like, hey, you know, you're going to study to be an electrical engineer.
*  And it's like, I don't want to be a fucking electrical engineer.
*  Well, you got to have discipline.
*  And so they don't have the drive and they don't get excited about it and they don't do.
*  But if you tell that guy, whatever, you're going to be a golfer and he fucking loves golf
*  and he's practicing every day and he becomes a professional golfer.
*  And you say, well, I thought that guy didn't have any discipline.
*  Well, it's not that he didn't have any discipline.
*  He's just not interested in that other thing.
*  I was never a disciplined kid, but I would find things that I loved and I was obsessed.
*  And I always felt embarrassed by it because people would say, oh, your son, like to my mom,
*  your son is so disciplined.
*  And she'd be like, my son's fucking crazy.
*  Like, he's not disciplined.
*  He finds these things and that's all he does all day long.
*  Like, it's not really discipline because he doesn't clean his room.
*  He's fucking lazy.
*  There's all sorts of shit he's supposed to do.
*  I never did my homework.
*  There's all the.
*  But if I had a thing that I was into, I was obsessed.
*  You're crazy about it.
*  But it would bother me that I didn't really have discipline.
*  Like if I had jobs that I had to do, I didn't do a good job with them, like construction jobs that I had.
*  But when it came to martial arts.
*  How did you find those things, though?
*  How did you find those things?
*  Did you stumble upon them?
*  I just got lucky.
*  Just got luck.
*  Martial arts, I just got lucky.
*  And it clicked with me like almost immediately.
*  I became obsessed.
*  You know, and I wanted to be, I wanted to excel at it.
*  And so I was just doing it all day long.
*  And it was kind of stunning from my family because they didn't even know I had that in me.
*  Like they thought that I was just going to be this ne'er do well, you know, because I just really could.
*  You know, because I just really couldn't concentrate on these jobs that I would have.
*  I just, I was bored.
*  But when I wasn't bored, I was very excited by things.
*  I think for whatever reason, whether it's my genetics or my upbringing, I just had a very weird personality that didn't fit in with normal work.
*  I was allergic to the idea of having a nine to five.
*  I've never been in an office.
*  Like I've never worked in a place where I was about around a bunch of people.
*  Never, never had one.
*  I just deliver newspapers.
*  I worked on construction sites.
*  I drove limos.
*  And then I became a comic and I taught Taekwondo along the way.
*  But that's it.
*  I luckily dodged that bullet.
*  But that was the fear.
*  Like there was something in me that was like, I can't fucking do that.
*  I would go to visit my mom at work.
*  I would see people that were working in an office.
*  I'm like, I can't fucking do this.
*  Just repulsed you.
*  It was like I was in a sewer.
*  I would be in there.
*  I'd be like, I got to get out of here.
*  These people, there's no fucking light in here.
*  They're all wearing ties.
*  They're all wearing slippery-soled shoes.
*  And you got to listen to this.
*  Jack Off was in the corner office.
*  Like what the fuck kind of life is this?
*  It just felt constricting.
*  Like there was no oxygen.
*  Like I had to get out of the room.
*  Like, oh, oh.
*  You have ADD?
*  I'm sure I have it.
*  100%.
*  I don't have it.
*  I don't know if that's real.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I don't know what that means.
*  Well, I read a great book.
*  And now it's called The Edison Gene.
*  And I've never been clinically diagnosed, but I definitely have it.
*  And you'd know if you like, we probably have.
*  I think I probably have it.
*  We probably both have it.
*  And so he argues, the author argues in The Edison Gene, that really it's not a thing.
*  What it is is a hunter-gatherer gene that's a remnant gene.
*  He says, we were all hunter-gatherers.
*  And as a hunter-gatherer, we have to scan the environment.
*  We're looking for threats.
*  We're looking for things to eat.
*  Right.
*  And so you're all over the place.
*  But then when that deer comes out, you're on, just like you found martial arts.
*  And you were on, right?
*  But otherwise, you're kind of scanning the environment and you're not really interested.
*  And then you're interested.
*  And then we became an agrarian society.
*  And now we're planting seeds and we're sitting there drinking coffee and we got the suits on, right?
*  And we're a little more proper.
*  But some people still have that hunter-gatherer gene.
*  And you're like, I don't want to fucking sit around and wait for shit to grow.
*  I want to make shit happen.
*  I want to go after stuff.
*  So that's his argument.
*  And I suspect that's what you're talking about.
*  Well, see, here's where I diverged there because I think gathering and farming and stuff is kind of exciting.
*  Like growing things and watching food come out of the ground and processing that food or harvesting that food and then eating it.
*  Like eating a salad that you grew yourself.
*  There's something very rewarding.
*  A thousand percent agree with that.
*  Very rewarding about that.
*  But sitting still.
*  Right. That's not rewarding.
*  What's not rewarding to me is being compliant to a bunch of other people.
*  You've got some weird rigid rules and you're under fluorescent lighting and you're in some strange environment that's not natural.
*  What I think is the people that adapt to that world, that nine to five world, are more compliant.
*  They're more willing.
*  German. Japanese.
*  But I don't even, yeah, maybe in some way.
*  But I don't know.
*  Those tendencies.
*  I don't know whether it's cultural.
*  But there's something about the human beings that are willing to do that office work.
*  They're willing to go and abide by the rules of human resources.
*  That just, there's no, I have none of that in me.
*  To me it's just, that's like death.
*  Here's the question though.
*  People that are listening to this, I found, I don't know if you agree with this, there were a ton of kids along the way growing up as I was building my business that would say, I'm not into this.
*  I'm not into that.
*  Kind of like you described yourself.
*  And they don't do anything because they're looking for that thing.
*  And I would argue, do something.
*  Do fucking something until you find that thing.
*  I've never been that kid though.
*  I've always been into things.
*  I was into art.
*  Or I was into something.
*  I always found things that I was interested in.
*  Just none of them seemed like they were normal things that other people wanted to do for a living.
*  Like the path, like a career path.
*  But I think that there's a lot of people that don't have any, there's no one, they're not modeling their life after someone that they see that they admire.
*  Someone that's successful.
*  Someone that is doing something that they enjoy and love.
*  Sometimes kids have to see that.
*  And if their parents are living a bullshit life and their neighbors are living a bullshit life and most of their family lives a bullshit life, they just fucking lay around.
*  And then they seek refuge in drugs or video games or something that stimulates them.
*  And video games are a real problem.
*  They're a real problem.
*  You know why?
*  Because they're fucking fun.
*  Addictive.
*  Yeah.
*  Well I have a real problem with them.
*  And you do them and they're real exciting but you don't get anywhere.
*  It's like you could do, like martial arts, right?
*  You could learn Jiu-Jitsu.
*  You could get obsessed by Jiu-Jitsu.
*  And then three years later you're like an elite Jiu-Jitsu athlete.
*  Like you're entering in competitions.
*  You're a purple belt.
*  You're moving up.
*  Yeah. You're doing well.
*  You're thinking like I might be able to open my own school one day.
*  You got confidence.
*  Yeah. If I have a hundred students and those hundred students are paying me X amount of dollars per month, I can make a living.
*  Holy shit.
*  I can have a, this would be amazing.
*  And then you see your Jiu-Jitsu school and your Jiu-Jitsu instructor has all these students and drives a Mercedes and he's got a nice family.
*  And like that's the future.
*  This way you're doing something exciting and fun and you don't, or you could just be playing fucking video games.
*  Three years later you could be that same kid just playing video games, waiting for the next, whatever the fuck game is, you know, next Xbox game to come out and you're going to waste your time.
*  You have children.
*  I have children.
*  And it's a big battle in the house.
*  Yes.
*  And my kids, I don't know if you're going through this, but my kids are now saying, well, dad, this guy made all this money with this video game.
*  He's a man.
*  That's real too.
*  That's real too now.
*  So like that's one in a billion kid.
*  I don't know if it's one in a billion, but you know, look, I heard the same argument about comedy.
*  You know, my own parents were like, do you know how few people make it as a comedian?
*  I was like, okay, does anybody make it?
*  Somebody makes it, right?
*  They figure out how to do it.
*  They make a living.
*  I'm going to do that.
*  Just stop.
*  I know what I'm doing.
*  I was real lucky that my parents were not around very much, so I didn't get much advice.
*  So I figured it out myself.
*  So there was no one telling me I couldn't do it.
*  So Greenfield.
*  I yeah, I just I was like, I'm going to find my way through this.
*  And since no one's telling me it's impossible, no one's telling me I can't occasionally I would hear someone say, what are the odds?
*  I'm like, listen, this fucking loser.
*  That's my thought was always like, that guy's a loser.
*  Like if you think like that, you're a loser.
*  But there are kids that make a lot of fucking money playing video games.
*  But the thing is, like you have to be adaptable.
*  You have to be able to play multiple video games because the one video game that you get really good at, what are the odds?
*  That's going to be around five years from now.
*  You know, like what's the big one now?
*  Like Fortnite is that they make money off of that?
*  Yeah.
*  And then there's Call of Duty.
*  They make money off that.
*  What's the big money?
*  Starcraft used to be the big one, right?
*  That League of Legends Counter-Strike.
*  Counter-Strike is still the Half-Life mod.
*  Variations of it have come out, but it's still basically the same exact game.
*  They don't make money off Quake though, right?
*  Not really.
*  Nah, really.
*  One or two guys do, I think.
*  Yeah.
*  See, you got to pick the right game.
*  You know, you can be obsessed with the wrong game.
*  What are you going to do?
*  Spend five, 10 hours a day in the house?
*  You have to.
*  You would have to.
*  I'd vomit if I could.
*  Let's go down this road.
*  Can I read you?
*  Sure.
*  A text.
*  You're going to die with this one.
*  Okay.
*  I, a month ago, about a month ago, I said, listen, school's out, all the kids are playing
*  video games.
*  I'm going to hold a camp on the farm, kind of like what I did with the guy that was having.
*  I'm going to invite friends and family's kids because nobody's going to send me kids that
*  don't know me.
*  It's going to be a fucking badass camp, 14 days of hell, no video games, no phones, and
*  we are just going to crush these kids and turn them into little soldiers.
*  How old are these kids you're talking about?
*  I had my seven-year-old daughter all the way up to an 18-year-old.
*  I have four children, so seven to 18, most of them 11 and 13.
*  Is this their idea or their parents' idea?
*  I get the idea and I reach out to a bunch of friends and family and I said, I want to
*  hold this camp, call it from the end of June through mid-July.
*  Who's in?
*  They're my older kids.
*  You're going to keep the kids there?
*  I'm going to keep the kids on the farm.
*  I'm going to feed them.
*  It's on me, but I'm going to turn them into, it'll be fun.
*  I'm embellishing a little bit when I use some of these words like fun.
*  Really what I want to do is turn them into warriors and get them off the frigging phones.
*  Selfishly, for me, selfishly I want my kids to be like, it's hard for me to do this to
*  another 16 kids around, 18 kids around, everybody gets sucked up in the vortex.
*  So anyway, first day, unbeknownst to me, we left their phones in their rooms.
*  And unbeknownst to me, every night when they got done with their work, they would then
*  get on the phones, of course they would, I just wasn't thinking about it, and start texting
*  the parents.
*  Get me the fuck out of here.
*  This guy's fucking nuts, right?
*  But I don't know that's happening.
*  My wife's not there, I got our four children, I got 18 other kids, and the texts that are
*  going back to the parents those first three days, I'm going to read you one.
*  But they're going nonstop.
*  And they eventually get to my wife.
*  She then immediately races to Vermont, like, what are you doing?
*  This is not even your business.
*  Why are you doing this?
*  People are going to hate us.
*  We can't do this.
*  So I'm fighting with her.
*  I'm fighting with the kids' parents, because now I'm five days in and I'm saying, listen,
*  our four kids are going to finish.
*  The Descent of kids are going to finish this.
*  Well, what is, you set up a schedule?
*  So I got an Olympic wrestler living with us, a guy named Andy Rovat, who just happens to
*  live with us, which is a story.
*  I've got a Mountain Warfare school veteran who's there in Vermont.
*  And I've got this woman we call the seed huntress.
*  So she's more like my mom, Bohemian, this and that.
*  And those three people are going to provide expertise along with my insanity of, all right,
*  we're going up and down the mountain.
*  We're carrying rocks.
*  We're going to ice cold water.
*  And we're going to run it like buds, basically, the kids, the girls and the boys.
*  So at the end of it, I get texts from the parents that say, do you know, let me send
*  you some of the texts I was receiving while you were there, Joe.
*  So this is the parent.
*  How's it going?
*  So this 15 year old son, kid responds, awful.
*  Parent says, Joe said you're doing great.
*  Kid says, this might be the worst experience of my entire life.
*  It's literally like we're in the military.
*  Parents not taking the bait.
*  Parents says, there's got to be something good about it.
*  Kid says, literally nothing.
*  Parent says, is it harder than a seven minute Peloton ride?
*  He just won't take the fucking bait.
*  Kid says, dad, you try carrying 35 pound rocks up and down the mountain all day.
*  Dad says, come on, no funny stories.
*  Kid says, when they get mad at us, they stick us in a freezing cold river until somebody
*  cries.
*  No, and the counselors are terrible.
*  Dad says, what else did you do today?
*  That sounds like a dad who knows his son needs this.
*  Yeah, you know, and this is the right kind of dad.
*  I didn't have experience ever before dealing with parents that wouldn't let their kid struggle
*  a little bit.
*  Right.
*  And so I happened to have a dad.
*  This dad didn't come after me.
*  The other parents were all coming after me like, oh, we don't want psychological damage.
*  You should release the kids.
*  Your wife's got to come there and stop this.
*  Dad, I spent 45 minutes keeping my legs off the ground six inches today.
*  Dad says, it'll be great for your six pack.
*  Kid says, dad, this place sucks.
*  You never have enough water.
*  You never have enough food.
*  I almost passed out today.
*  Are you and mom hearing me?
*  Dad says, don't be a pussy.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I like the dad.
*  Kid says, if you or mom spent one day in these conditions, you would both be dead.
*  Dad says, you need to embrace it.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Hang on.
*  I'm going to read you the word.
*  Maybe the dad just said, fuck you.
*  I'll do it with you.
*  It gets better because at the end, I did have the dad.
*  I had the parents come.
*  Dad finally says, do you want us to call Joe?
*  Call Joe.
*  He'll lighten up on you.
*  Kid says, you clearly never met this guy.
*  He is a psychopath.
*  This is an illegal camp run by a crazy person.
*  This is a 15-year-old kid who has tricked kids to come here to do farm work for him,
*  manual labor, and he punishes us whenever he feels like it.
*  If you or mom were here, you would understand that.
*  You put your son in a dangerous situation, but instead you're sitting on a fancy couch
*  in our home laughing at our son's serious health concerns.
*  Wow.
*  Needless to say, the kid thanked me at the end.
*  How long was he there for?
*  14 days.
*  14 days to hell.
*  He's five days in when he's five days in.
*  I could read.
*  I got dozens.
*  How did he turn around in the next nine?
*  You know what?
*  Nine.
*  Our message to them, well, we took the phones once I got the tip off.
*  We took the phones and there was no way out.
*  The message to them was, when you can't change your situation, you change yourself.
*  You're fucking stuck here.
*  Figure it out.
*  What I just read to makes it sound a lot worse than it actually was.
*  He's probably being dramatic.
*  He was being dramatic.
*  It's hard work, but kids need it.
*  You're not getting that in the basement.
*  They need to understand that you can struggle.
*  You can realize that sometimes when things are really hard to do, you think, oh my God,
*  I got to stop doing this.
*  But once you do it and you complete it, you have a satisfaction, this sense of satisfaction
*  that you did something really difficult that is irreplaceable.
*  Some kids never get that and they just stay fat and stupid their whole life.
*  Some kids, they get these little lessons and then they realize you can push yourself and
*  you can get somewhere.
*  Some kids get real lucky and they get involved in sports or martial arts early.
*  One of the best benefits of sports is you realize that through hard work, you get improvement.
*  Through improvement, you get success.
*  Through success, you get that big dopamine rush.
*  You get that good feeling.
*  Confidence.
*  You get confidence.
*  You get this knowledge.
*  You get the girl.
*  Yeah, you get, sometimes I didn't, but you get this knowledge that you can do something
*  that's difficult and you can overcome even though it feels like you can't.
*  That's one of the beautiful things about the belt system of martial arts.
*  You start off as a beginner.
*  You start off as a white belt.
*  Then as things go on, you get a new belt.
*  When your instructor takes your old belt off and ties your new one off, your new one on,
*  you have this amazing feeling of accomplishment.
*  Wow.
*  Then you know that there's a goal.
*  At the end of the rainbow is a black belt.
*  I might get to be a black belt someday.
*  It's gamified.
*  Yeah, it's real possible.
*  Then you know other people that do get their black belt.
*  You're like, wow, what's it like?
*  You see people that are a little bit ahead of you in the race.
*  This is incredible.
*  You have people to model.
*  Other successful people to model.
*  You see those black belts in the corporate.
*  You see disciplined people.
*  When you talk about cold showers, when I was a kid, there was a black belt.
*  When I was just starting out, his name was Bob Caffarella.
*  When I was a white belt, he was a black belt.
*  He was living at the school.
*  We lived in Boston.
*  It was cold as fuck in the winter.
*  This guy would take cold showers.
*  We were all terrified of him anyway.
*  He would get in that shower.
*  I just couldn't believe he could do it because it was so cold.
*  This was after training.
*  He would just get in there and he wouldn't even budge.
*  Just sit there and breathe.
*  I tried it one time.
*  I got in there.
*  I turned that water on cold.
*  I stepped in there.
*  I was like, fuck this.
*  I got out and I ran into the locker room and everyone was laughing.
*  I was like, how is he doing that?
*  Some people, you learn from them.
*  You see these people that can over- Now I take regular cold showers.
*  Now I do cryotherapy.
*  I get in 250 degrees below zero and I stand there for three minutes.
*  I wait 10 minutes.
*  I go back in there again.
*  You learn how to overcome.
*  You learn how to deal with that.
*  You learn you wouldn't die.
*  You also learn that it's not that bad.
*  It's an opportunity to go inward.
*  It's an opportunity to focus your energy and your thoughts on the deepest aspects, the
*  deepest center of your mind and think about your breathing and think about that.
*  Don't think about the fact, oh my God, it's so cold.
*  Oh my God, it's so hot.
*  I'm dishonest.
*  I got to get out of there.
*  Instead of thinking about that, just think about your breathing.
*  Just go deep.
*  Close your eyes.
*  Go deep to the center of your mind and stay there.
*  Just stay there.
*  Quiet down.
*  Yeah.
*  You learn how to do that or you don't or you stay fat, you stay stupid, you stay lazy.
*  But maybe you never had that chance.
*  Maybe.
*  That's why I wanted the kids there because they'll never get that.
*  Like you said, if they're not in a sport or whatever.
*  When I found when all these texts were coming in and my wife wanted to divorce me and all
*  this shit was happening just three, four weeks ago, I got in touch with a neurosurgeon and
*  I said, would you talk to the kids?
*  And the neurosurgeon said, which I didn't know, you probably know this.
*  He said, kids, when you take on something hard, it could be a cold shower, it could
*  be this 14 day crazy camp with Joe, the belt system.
*  If you don't finish it, it leaves a physical gap in the brain.
*  Literally, we could see as a neurosurgeon that the wires are unconnected because you
*  never finished it.
*  But when you finish it, it leaves like train tracks.
*  And so the more tracks you could lay, like you were laying them as you were getting the
*  belt system, right?
*  The advantage, you're going to have an advantage over your competitors.
*  So I thought that was interesting.
*  Like kids need to do hard shit.
*  And they need to finish what they start.
*  I think adults do too.
*  I think everybody does.
*  But kids need to learn it.
*  And many kids today don't learn it.
*  It is sad.
*  I think sports are really the best way for kids to learn it.
*  Sports are the best way because there's something about physical pursuits where you have to
*  motivate, the mind has to force the body to plow through discomfort.
*  It's a different kind of mental strength.
*  And there's mental strength in terms of like your ability to sit down and be disciplined
*  and study and do homework assignments and complete projects and do complex problems
*  and problem solving.
*  There's mental strength in that too.
*  But there's also the strength of the mind telling the body who the fucking boss is.
*  I love that sentence.
*  That's what it is.
*  You're like, no, bitch.
*  Your body's like, we got to stop.
*  Fuck you.
*  We're doing this.
*  Fuck you.
*  You almost like you have to have two people in your brain.
*  You have to have this general and you have to have a soldier.
*  And the general is like, listen motherfucker, we know what we're doing here.
*  We're going to get this done.
*  This is what we're doing today.
*  You got a list of shit on that paper.
*  It's got to get done.
*  It's 98 degrees outside and you're going to do it out here in the sun.
*  You got plenty of water.
*  Let's go.
*  I agree with that.
*  CT obviously, people like that have that.
*  Well he's the one, we should tell everybody, he's the one who brought us together, CT Fletcher.
*  He also broke your kettlebell.
*  He also broke my kettlebell today.
*  He threw your kettlebell and you had to get it welded today.
*  Literally, I show up at his place this morning to get some advice.
*  I'm going to be talking to Joe Rogan.
*  You've met him.
*  Can you give me some advice?
*  He grabs the kettlebell, throws it like a tennis ball.
*  It's pretty hard to throw this thing like a tennis ball.
*  He's a tank.
*  Breaks it.
*  Thank God there's a welding shop.
*  Because you had said to me in a text, hey make sure you bring the kettlebell.
*  So I'm like, I'm going to show up with a broken fucking kettlebell.
*  Well it would be a funny story if you showed up with a broken one, but it's cool that you
*  got it welded.
*  No, but he's a general and a soldier.
*  He's an animal.
*  Well CT is one of the most inspirational people online and one of the most inspirational people
*  I've ever met.
*  If you watch any of his videos, he's just a special person.
*  You want to talk about a guy who's gone through a journey after open heart surgery and having
*  his heart replaced.
*  Now he has a new person's heart.
*  I still think he doesn't know whose heart it is, right?
*  He said he thought it was an Asian woman.
*  He told me elderly woman I got from him.
*  Which is crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  Knowing the size of his biceps.
*  The workout he puts me, this morning he says we're going to do this, what the hell did
*  he call it, random selection.
*  Get on the tricep push down, which I don't do.
*  I do body weight stuff.
*  I'm just going to decide, Joe, every 10 reps what weight I'm changing it to.
*  He just kept changing it.
*  We get to 100 reps, my triceps are on fire.
*  He said just so you know, when I was training to be world champion, I would start with 300
*  reps as a warm up.
*  He's just an animal.
*  His arms are ridiculous.
*  Still to this day, he thinks he's lost muscle size.
*  How do you know?
*  Fucking big your arms are.
*  He's a big boy.
*  He's enormous.
*  When he was younger, he was really enormous.
*  But he had a terrible diet, unfortunately.
*  The Burger King or McDonald's and the fries.
*  A lot of shakes.
*  A lot of shakes.
*  Fries and shakes and just a lot of sugar and nonsense and bullshit.
*  When he was power lifting, when he was enormous, he was just eating whatever the fuck you felt
*  like eating.
*  Getting after it.
*  You're a hunter.
*  Yeah.
*  So I got a hunting story.
*  Okay.
*  So I'm not a farm boy at all, but I meet my wife, like I said, 2000.
*  We buy the farm in Vermont.
*  Why did you decide to buy a farm in Vermont?
*  You know, I so.
*  Where were you living at the time?
*  So I will go back.
*  So I built the swimming pool business, turned into a little bit of a construction company,
*  somehow fight my way, graduate college and meet a guy at Cornell who says, what are you
*  doing when you graduate?
*  I said, I'm going back to the neighborhood.
*  And he says, well, you're a fucking idiot.
*  He goes, you got to go to Wall Street.
*  I don't know anything about Wall Street.
*  I remember the 87 crash.
*  I figured people don't make money there anymore.
*  He says, it's just like the neighborhood, only they do it with a pen instead of a gun.
*  You got to go.
*  You got to go to Wall Street.
*  So he pushes me there and I land on Wall Street.
*  I get a job.
*  I eventually build a business.
*  I had a nice run.
*  And just like you, I didn't want to be at a desk.
*  I didn't like it.
*  I didn't feel good.
*  I started to gain weight.
*  The folks around me, we were making a lot of money, but folks had psychological problems
*  I couldn't fix.
*  Like, I can't believe John next to me got $50,000 more bonus than I did.
*  We're making more money than we deserve.
*  Are you fucking crazy?
*  Like, are you kidding me?
*  Right?
*  Like they had problems I couldn't fix.
*  So I was dying to get out of there.
*  I had a picture of a red barn on my desk.
*  I just wanted to go to a farm.
*  I don't know why.
*  I just wanted to leave.
*  I sold the business, found a farm in Vermont, covered bridge.
*  I did the whole thing and meet my wife and we buy this farm.
*  And got a tractor.
*  How long have you been doing this?
*  So 2000.
*  So 20 years ago, bought the farm.
*  And you just decide Vermont on what?
*  Vermont's gorgeous.
*  I was on a, I didn't know anything.
*  I knew Queens.
*  My wife, the girl I met was from Boston.
*  I didn't really, you know, if you're in Queens, you know Connecticut.
*  I didn't really know Vermont.
*  I'd skied in Vermont.
*  You probably skied in Vermont.
*  And I never have.
*  You never went?
*  I did some gigs up there though.
*  Okay.
*  I was doing stand up.
*  It's beautiful.
*  It's cold as fuck.
*  It's cold as fuck.
*  And so we had gone on a date, my wife and I, to a friend in Idaho.
*  We went out to Idaho for like a snowshoeing thing.
*  And on the way back, I saw this real estate magazine in the plane and it had homes and
*  ranches in Jackson Hole, which you got to be pretty wealthy to buy anything in Jackson
*  Crazy numbers.
*  There was one ad in that magazine that said a farmhouse in Vermont covered bridge, mountain,
*  horses, 420 grand.
*  I was like, why I gotta go to Vermont?
*  She's in Boston.
*  I'm in New York.
*  It's a lot cheaper than fucking Jackson Hole.
*  So no one's up there too.
*  No one's up there.
*  So we bought the place and we settled in, sold the business in New York and started
*  making kids.
*  I bought some Scottish Highlander cows and started to learn.
*  So those are those weird hairy cows?
*  Big hairy cows, the big horns, epic looking.
*  Why'd you get those?
*  They're beautiful.
*  They're just gorgeous.
*  Just for that reason?
*  Yeah, no reason.
*  There's like wooly mammoths.
*  Just want to have cool looking cows?
*  Yeah, like everybody's got a regular cow.
*  Let's get these cows.
*  How did you get those?
*  I just talked to a guy or another guy and he had five fucking Scottish Highlanders.
*  Then we had goats and chickens and trying to figure it all out.
*  One day the chickens came.
*  The chickens come in a post office.
*  They deliver them.
*  I used to have chickens.
*  What do you do with them?
*  I got 155 chickens.
*  You got 150?
*  So I had all these little chicks.
*  Wow, that's a lot of eggs.
*  That's a lot of eggs.
*  Did you get roosters too?
*  I got roosters.
*  I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.
*  I could just order more animals.
*  I don't know.
*  We're a farm.
*  You're supposed to have animals.
*  So anyway, I'm doing all this work to the farm.
*  Fixing up the old structures and stuff.
*  I need somebody to do excavation because the winter's coming and we're going to flood the
*  basement if I don't change the elevation of land a little bit, get the water to run away
*  when it snows.
*  But I can't find anybody to do excavation because they're telling me it's hunting season.
*  I don't hunt.
*  I don't know anything about hunting.
*  I said somebody's got to want a fucking job.
*  In Queens you get any.
*  Somebody's looking for work.
*  You've got to find somebody.
*  So a guy says to me, look, I'll rent you an excavator, a machine, and I think I've got
*  a guy that'll not go hunting and he'll run the machine.
*  One guy.
*  One guy.
*  So I said, all right, send them to me.
*  So I rent the machine.
*  Fuck, I can't remember his name, but I'll remember his name.
*  But anyway, he's operating the machine.
*  This is a true story.
*  This story's going to be fucking crazy.
*  This is a Quentin Tarantino movie.
*  So the carpentry work on all the things I'm fixing up are done by some Slovakians that
*  a guy sent me.
*  I've got four Slovakians doing carpentry work in the background.
*  I've now got Jeff is his name.
*  I got this guy, Jeff, that's running the excavator.
*  My wife just gave birth to our first child on the farm and we're like three weeks in
*  with our first new baby.
*  My mother-in-law is coming over to watch the baby and my wife and I are going to go to
*  for the first time in a while.
*  We're going to be able to get out of the house.
*  Slovakians doing carpentry, Jeff doing excavation, mom's going to watch the baby.
*  We're going to dinner.
*  Pull up in front of the house, 5 p.m., I'm going to grab my wife.
*  Jeff, the excavator, runs out to the front and sees me sweating profusely.
*  I said, what's up?
*  He said, motherfucker, he's pacing back and forth.
*  He says, you didn't let me go hunting.
*  He goes, I've hunted my whole life.
*  Okay, get out with it.
*  I got to get my wife.
*  I'm going to dinner.
*  He said, I couldn't help myself.
*  I was operating the machine in the backyard and a deer ran by.
*  I fucking jumped off the machine.
*  I tackled it and killed it with a handsaw.
*  What?
*  Okay.
*  So again, I'm just telling you what he told me.
*  So what's the problem?
*  I'm saying, assuming the story is true, why are you sweating?
*  I didn't tell you.
*  I'm on probation.
*  Hunting season ended yesterday.
*  If somebody sees the deer is not tagged, I don't know what any of this means.
*  I'm going to get arrested.
*  I'm going to bury the deer in the backyard.
*  I said, dude, I said, um, kill the deer with a hand saw.
*  So, so, so later on, the story from the local said, if that happened, the deer was probably
*  wounded because it was just and hunting season just ended.
*  It's probably moving slow if he did that.
*  But you're going to love the story.
*  It gets more interesting.
*  I'm going to bury it in the backyard.
*  Don't bury the fucking deer.
*  I got to take my wife to dinner.
*  Put it in the bucket of the backhoe, right?
*  Lift it up off the ground.
*  I'll call a neighbor.
*  I'm sure nobody caught a deer.
*  That's to show you how much I know about, right?
*  Caught a deer, right?
*  Right.
*  Nobody, right?
*  Nobody caught a deer.
*  They'll want one.
*  I'll just give it away.
*  Wife gets in the car.
*  I'm driving to dinner and I call Dave Fisher.
*  I'm remembering the name, my neighbor.
*  And I said, Hey, Dave, um, I got a deer in the bucket on my backyard.
*  You know, I'm not going to get into how it got there.
*  Do you?
*  I said, well, it's a pretty warm night.
*  Should you get it now?
*  No, I'll get in the morning.
*  Perfect.
*  Problem solved.
*  Go to dinner with my wife, come back, go to bed, wake up in the morning.
*  No deer in the backhoe.
*  Everything's great.
*  I go to the general store.
*  There's only one general store in our town.
*  It's the only place to eat.
*  Go into the general store and the manager of the general store says, Hey, Joe, you want
*  some venison for lunch?
*  I said, how do we have, how is there venison?
*  Never had venison.
*  He says, you never believe it.
*  He says late last night, the Slovakians were done doing the carpentry.
*  They walked past the backhoe.
*  They found a dead deer in the backhoe.
*  They dragged it here a mile.
*  They dragged it to the general store, gutted it and it's now in the freezer.
*  I said, this is not even believable.
*  This fucking story is crazy.
*  I said, I don't want any venison.
*  And if Dave Fisher, the neighbor happens to come in, um, do not tell him about this because
*  now I don't know if I'm like, I don't know the law with this, right?
*  You're supposed to have a tag deer, not tag deer.
*  Fast forward.
*  It's now Christmas time, right?
*  Hunting season was November.
*  It's now Christmas time and, um, I am stuck in New York during a snowstorm.
*  I call a car service that I used to use when I was on Wall Street.
*  There are a bunch of Turkish guys.
*  They speak with very little English.
*  You do want to drive me up to Vermont.
*  It's like a five hour drive with the snowstorm might be eight hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Tony, Tony will take you.
*  It drives me up.
*  We're 15 minutes from the farm.
*  He says, Joe, anywhere to get any deer up here?
*  I said, I can't even believe this fucking guy's asking me this.
*  I said, uh, go to the general store, go see the manager.
*  There's deer in the bay.
*  He'll cut you a piece.
*  Right?
*  Again, I don't know how, right?
*  A week later, it's Christmas.
*  It's the only time the Slovakians take off.
*  They're taking two weeks off.
*  They surround me in my garage and they're talking.
*  They don't speak English.
*  I called my friend in New York.
*  I said, you got to translate.
*  I don't know if they want to raise.
*  I don't know if they don't want to work for us anymore.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  He says, um, they want to know where the fuck their deer is.
*  I said, what are you talking about?
*  I call Michael at the general store.
*  I said, Mike, what happened to the deer?
*  He says, what do you mean?
*  The Turkish guy came.
*  He said he could have the deer.
*  We loaded the whole deer in his trunk, frozen.
*  He drove it back to New York.
*  Oh boy.
*  Fucking crazy story.
*  I gave, I gave the address of the Turkish guy to the Slovakians.
*  I never, I never heard from the Turkish guy again.
*  I have no idea.
*  Probably shouldn't be saying it on the largest podcast in the world.
*  Slovakian guys went after the Turkish guy for one deer.
*  For one deer.
*  So that's my, that's my only hunting story ever.
*  He could have a piece of deer and he took the whole, the hoofs, the fucking head, everything.
*  Oh boy.
*  And they had dragged it a mile to the store from the backhoe.
*  And what about the neighbor who you told that was in the backhoe?
*  Did he ever ask?
*  Dave Fisher never asked again.
*  Dave Fisher never asked again.
*  Jeff, Jeff, the operator, never to be seen again.
*  The guy who killed him.
*  Never to be seen again.
*  I don't buy that story.
*  Unless it was really fucked up.
*  There's no way you're catching a deer with your bare hands.
*  Which is what the locals said.
*  It was probably shot.
*  Yeah.
*  It was probably wounded.
*  The only time that could happen is if the animals in the rut.
*  Sometimes when they're in the rut, the males go so crazy that there's a video, it's a crazy
*  video of a guy is in a blind.
*  He's in a hunting blind and this buck is so out of it that he actually taps his antlers
*  with the arrow.
*  He's got an arrow in his hand.
*  He taps him like tap, tap and the buck's like, he's just so out of it because they're so
*  horny.
*  They lose their fucking mind.
*  It's very rare that they behave like this, but they could work themselves up into such
*  a frenzy that they're like, they're like hallucinating.
*  They don't know what the fuck's going on.
*  They're not scared of danger.
*  Maybe it was a very horny deer.
*  They get really crazy.
*  I doubt it that this guy's going to kill it with a handsaw.
*  He sounds crazy.
*  The whole thing was crazy.
*  The whole thing doesn't make any sense.
*  Hunter wouldn't, you're not bloodthirsty.
*  You're going to jump on a deer with a saw.
*  You use a goddamn rifle.
*  The fact that this guy waited till the day after hunting season was over and knew it
*  and still killed it with a saw, that doesn't make any sense.
*  None of it makes any sense.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why it would be a good movie.
*  It would be a good Coen Brothers movie.
*  It would be a good Coen Brothers movie.
*  Yeah.
*  That would be a good movie.
*  Well, I bet a place like Vermont, you get a lot of those sort of Coen Brothers movies.
*  It's very Funny Farm.
*  Remember Funny Farm?
*  No.
*  There was a movie with Chevy Chase where he lived in Vermont.
*  Oh, that was Vermont too?
*  Cue the Deer.
*  Remember that?
*  How do people feel about Bernie Sanders up there?
*  I mean, it's very divided.
*  There's the third generation Vermonter, hardworking farmer, and then there's all the New York,
*  New Jersey, Boston transplants, very hippie, crunchy.
*  And those are the ones like Bernie Sanders.
*  They love Bernie and I got to be careful what I say.
*  But I would say this, I don't know what your feeling is on this, but I would say it's much
*  better when people work for a living.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think it is too.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I definitely think it's much better when people work for a living.
*  I think what Bernie wants is people to earn a living wage for their work.
*  I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what he wants.
*  Well, I don't think he wants to give people free money.
*  I think he wants people to be able to earn a living.
*  And he thinks that there's a lot of greedy Wall Street people that are essentially stealing
*  money.
*  We were definitely overpaid for our job, no doubt about it.
*  I mean, the whole place is crazy.
*  So I agree with that.
*  But the other side of it, I think there's always the pendulum swings too far.
*  is in Vermont.
*  And again, I'm going to piss a ton of people off here.
*  There's a lot of free stuff, free cheese, free phones, free this.
*  I've had a lot of stories where people say to me, I haven't had this experience myself
*  where there's negative selection, where folks will come to Vermont because of all those
*  free things.
*  And what do you mean by free?
*  Why are they?
*  There's support.
*  It's basically if you if you're below a certain level, a level of income, you get all the
*  support.
*  And I'm not against supporting people.
*  I mean, look, I opened my farm up to the whole world, to kids, to people that are having
*  trouble with weight.
*  But but I think you feel better when you earn it, kind of like you said with the belt system.
*  Like if you just walked into a and they just gave you a belt, you would certainly
*  true.
*  I only feel better when you earn things.
*  Yeah.
*  So so that's my that's my only issue.
*  So how did you get started?
*  How did you start the whole Spartan race thing?
*  So I'm on the farm.
*  I got one leg still in Wall Street, one leg on the farm selling the business.
*  I'm feeling overweight and out of shape.
*  Let's go way back.
*  My mom, mom introduces me to a thirty one hundred mile run in Queens, New York that
*  still exists today.
*  Thirty one hundred miles around a one mile loop.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah.
*  It's called the transcendence run.
*  Even before that had a different name.
*  Because she met the yogi and the yogi believed that human beings could do things much
*  greater than they think they can.
*  They're only held back by the limit of their mind.
*  And we're going to set up this running race, one mile loop, 50 to 60 days.
*  And you're just going to transcend the possible.
*  You're just going to go around and around and around.
*  About seven to eight people do it a year.
*  I did not do it as a kid.
*  I'm a very young kid, but I see it and it probably makes an imprint somewhere in my
*  brain.
*  Right.
*  I'm on Wall Street.
*  I'm getting out of that business.
*  I'm going to the farm, met my wife and I start racing myself.
*  I start doing all these crazy races around the world, not thirty one hundred miles, but
*  crazy stuff.
*  And I feel good.
*  Like you felt in the dojo.
*  Right.
*  Is that the right term?
*  Sure.
*  You can use that term.
*  Dojo.
*  And I feel alive.
*  Like I'm sweating and working and eating healthy and kind of like I have a I find that I have
*  a boxing match coming up and it's forcing me to train for it.
*  So right.
*  I'm waking up early or I'm not drinking.
*  I'm going to bed.
*  I'm doing all the things I'm supposed to do because I got a battle coming and I had so
*  much fun with it that I said I want to do this for other people.
*  I want to put on events and have them experience.
*  What I get to meet myself during those events.
*  I find out who I am.
*  I get to places where I just want water, food and shelter.
*  And I'm not worried about payroll and all the bullshit of life or deers being buried in my back.
*  Right.
*  I just I just want to just survive the next step.
*  And could I do this as a business?
*  This would feel really purposeful, kind of like you found your things and you felt good about.
*  And so put on the first race and it was like hell to get people there.
*  It's kind of like the kids camp.
*  I got to lie to people and say this is going to be fun.
*  It'll be like a barbecue, which it wasn't.
*  And I'm going to just I'm going to torture folks and put obstacles out there.
*  Be very military inspired.
*  Got a cool name, Spartan, and 500 people showed up and a thousand and fifteen hundred, then two thousand and ten thousand.
*  Then we're in one country, two countries, ten countries, eventually 45.
*  I was in a battle with a company called Tough Mudder, nonstop battle.
*  About what? Well, they we were we were both in the same industry.
*  Right. And they were they were having races on the same weekends.
*  I was having races. So if I'm out marketing and they're out, how do I convince people to come to my race and not their race in the same towns?
*  Same town, sometimes same location.
*  So if we announced the location, then they would announce a similar location the weekend before the weekend after it was like a.
*  So they were doing it on purpose.
*  Yeah, we were we were we were in a knockdown drag out fight.
*  That's so weird.
*  Yeah. For 10 for 10 plus years, it was in the media.
*  It was it was a big battle.
*  And that battle forced me to be better as a business owner.
*  Like, right. I had to be on my toes.
*  I had to I had to fight for us to survive.
*  And we ended up buying them and they're buying them pre covid, which was the absolute worst time
*  ever. Can't seem to get anything right.
*  But but yeah.
*  So so you bought them.
*  Do you incorporate any of what they do into what you do or did you just buy them and just assume them?
*  We bought them. And the way I look at it and you tell me what you think, the way I look at it is we want to be the LVMH.
*  The Louis Vuitton owns all these brands.
*  Vale Resorts owns all these ski locations.
*  We want to own all these different types of events that are basically the boxing matches for people.
*  And so you could sign up and buy a season pass and you just choose your poison.
*  I'm going to do this this month. I'm going to do that that month.
*  And so I don't want to they're not going to converge.
*  Tough Mudder is going to be its own thing, just like it was when we were fighting.
*  Spartan will be its own thing.
*  We've got a couple other brands in there, just trail runs, this thing called DECA.
*  And I'm really just trying to put dates on people's calendars, like a boxing match.
*  Just give them something to challenge themselves to train for.
*  And hopefully they're like the boxers you described that actually do the work.
*  Yeah. And and I'll get people healthier because there's something good about the fact that some boxers don't do
*  the work. You get to learn when a guy shows up at a world heavyweight title fight at 280 plus pounds.
*  And everybody goes, oh, boy, you young boxers go, don't be that guy.
*  You know, there's there's lessons in people's failures.
*  They're all there for you. It's all like there's there's knowledge out there, positive and negative.
*  You can learn a lot from people's fuck ups.
*  So you don't have to fuck up yourself.
*  I like that. I like that. I mean, you're right.
*  Now, I like lazy people.
*  Yeah. They make people that aren't lazy feel better.
*  They make them look better.
*  They make they make it more impressive.
*  You know, when you see a lazy person and then you see a guy like my friend, Jaco, Jaco Wulink, you go, OK, that guy's even more impressive.
*  Getting after I know people are just fuck ups and they find a reason to not do what they should do.
*  Isn't it so you tell me, isn't it so easy to stand head and shoulders above, like show up a little earlier?
*  Right. Go to bed a little or drink a little.
*  Like, it's not that hard.
*  It's not that hard to stand out to work hard.
*  No. But, you know, in creative endeavors, that's what's weird.
*  It's like creativity is a weird thing.
*  And there's some benefit in indulgence.
*  Creativity is weird.
*  Like some of the great artists, like here's a perfect example.
*  Stephen King, when he was at his best, was doing blow and drinking like a fucking case of beer a night.
*  That's when he was at his best when he wrote Carrie and Cujo and he was out of his fucking mind.
*  Apparently, he doesn't even remember writing Cujo.
*  Really?
*  Doesn't he remember writing it?
*  Yeah, he's just blasted out of his fucking mind.
*  But what what happens in that funk of that fog of cocaine and alcohol and nicotine and and just mashing those keys and just digging into the deep recesses of his mind?
*  I'm not convinced you could reach that on the natch.
*  I don't know if you can.
*  I think I mean, there is discipline in the fact that he sat down and did that work.
*  There's discipline in the fact that he was there, but he wasn't taking care of himself.
*  He wasn't drinking water and doing sit ups.
*  He that motherfucker would sit in front of that keyboard and torture himself with blow and write these masterpieces that to this day freak people the fuck out.
*  You read Carrie to this day.
*  You're like, who wrote this?
*  What is going on in this man's mind?
*  But you're not you're not suggesting we all do that.
*  You're just saying we got a tremendous benefit as a society because that guy did that.
*  I'm just saying that there's some it's hard.
*  There's no real when you're talking about creative things like Charles Bukowski is another example.
*  It's a fucking drunk man.
*  He wrote amazing shit.
*  But that guy would just lay around and drink and he would hit his girlfriend on camera like they were crazy.
*  He was a crazy man.
*  But you read some of his work and you're like, wow, this is genius shit.
*  There's something about that one undisciplined fucked up but purposeful life that reached millions.
*  So I don't think there's a hard fast rule.
*  I think activity and action are crucial.
*  Right. Inactivity is always bad.
*  Someone who's lazy, sits around, does nothing is always bad.
*  But when it comes to creative endeavors, sometimes indulgence, sometimes it's not a lack of discipline because the work still gets done.
*  But they're not taking care of themselves.
*  It's not self-care, but the results are spectacular.
*  Do you think it's the exception or the norm for those amazing like is it all is it all of them?
*  I think it's energy.
*  I think we look at it in terms of good and bad.
*  And sometimes you can't look at things and you can't.
*  Everything's not binary.
*  You know, like if you want to talk about a healthy person, right?
*  A person who's running, a person who's competing in athletic endeavors.
*  Well, that person has very specific requirements of their body.
*  Like, you know, you're going to run 3100 miles, man.
*  I mean, Jesus Christ, you're going to have to do that running.
*  You're going to have to you're going to have to be in shape if you do the Moab 240.
*  You know, you want to do that.
*  You want to run 240 miles through the fucking mountains.
*  But if you want to write a book, you don't necessarily have to do sit ups, you know,
*  you don't necessarily have to even be healthy.
*  And there's some people who just want to write a book and there's there's some weird energy to being drunk.
*  You know, there's weird energy to smoking cigarettes, there's weird energy to taking amphetamines,
*  there's weird energy to sitting in front of a computer and coming up with these ideas.
*  It's not good for the body, but sometimes the results, like sometimes people sacrifice health
*  and they sacrifice wellness in order to achieve creative goals.
*  I don't know if it's required, but I just know it's been done.
*  And the results for some people are amazing.
*  This is nothing I would ever encourage.
*  Certainly never encourage my kids to do it.
*  Certainly would never encourage good friends to do it.
*  But there's something about these people that have made some of the great works of art,
*  some of the great great works of literature.
*  You know, they weren't healthy.
*  No, but one of the things that's driven me crazy forever is is high level CEOs and business owners.
*  Same thing. Yeah, they might not have those big creative bursts.
*  But they're under stress.
*  They're eating shit food. My dad was one of those eating shit food, right?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Focused nonstop on the business.
*  Yeah.
*  They achieve, in some cases, tremendous success, but they're fucking dead.
*  I wonder if they would have achieved that success if they had been eating healthy and taking care of themselves.
*  And I wonder if they would have looked at things the same way.
*  Like, what is your ultimate goal?
*  Is your ultimate goal numbers in a bank account or is your ultimate goal to feel good?
*  Outlive your competition.
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  I mean, I mean, don't you want, I love this term health span, right?
*  From the moment you wake up, you're alive to the moment you die.
*  Just be healthy.
*  Right.
*  You don't want to like let the last 20 years in the hospital is not a, that's not a good one.
*  Right. Like relative health is interesting too.
*  You see a guy who's 90 and you know, he's running marathons like, wow, that's something to aspire to.
*  But if you were 30 and all of a sudden your body was that 90 year old marathon runner,
*  you'd be like, what the fuck happened to me?
*  Right.
*  You'd be, you'd hate it.
*  Right.
*  Like it's not really healthy.
*  No, it's just healthy for 90.
*  It's healthy for 90.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. I just want to feel good.
*  Yes.
*  I just want to feel good.
*  So, so I mean, I look at this 92 year old guy, Bishi, I told you about that's on the fruits and veggies.
*  He's like sharp.
*  He, his argument is, look, he goes on this diet, you're not getting biceps.
*  You're not going to look like CT, right?
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm going to outlive people.
*  But CT is vegan.
*  CT is all vegan now.
*  He doesn't like that word.
*  He told me this morning.
*  He said he likes that plant based.
*  Yeah.
*  Because the kids are all using that word now.
*  That's the new word plant based.
*  Yeah.
*  Is he eating only plants?
*  That's what he said.
*  He said he's vegan.
*  No, he's vegan, but he doesn't like the word.
*  Yes.
*  Oh, well, the word is it's attached to a lot of annoying people.
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  Which is what he said.
*  He said, if you use that word, you tend to like lean on other people to become vegans.
*  I don't give a fuck what other people do.
*  I'm, I'm trying to make sure this heart lasts.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's the way to go to make your heart last.
*  You know, there's a lot of variables.
*  And there's a lot of people that have differing opinions, a lot of experts that have different
*  opinions in terms of nutrients that you're not going to get.
*  And, you know, and how to get those nutrients and how to make sure that the protein that
*  you're getting is bioavailable and that you're getting a full suite of vitamins with everything,
*  you know, with all your meals and making sure all your bases are covered.
*  It's tricky.
*  Do you think?
*  It certainly could be done, though.
*  Well, do you think here's my thought on it.
*  And again, I had my mom pushing for 30 years, right?
*  The diet, which I was pushing back from because I wanted the raviolis and the meat.
*  If you're a 10th generation or 20th generation from a particular place on the planet that
*  ate a certain way for 20 generations and their survival of the fittest, right?
*  Like those that couldn't last on that diet, died off and like you're probably
*  have a predisposition to eat that way in that part of the world, I would think.
*  There's certainly a good argument for that.
*  Right.
*  There's a genetic argument for your diet in terms of, you know, they can do they can
*  sequence your genome and go over your history and subscribe or prescribe to you a diet that's
*  based on your ancestry.
*  It's controversial, you know, because it does in some ways.
*  Yeah, but it's all anecdotal, you know, and then also like different people.
*  That's the problem with biodiversity.
*  Like people of different needs.
*  Some people do great on just fish and rice and veggies.
*  Other people really, they need more protein.
*  They need more meat.
*  They survive better on a red meat based diet.
*  Some people, they survive better on just eggs and vegetables.
*  I mean, it's like, but I think the most important thing is you have to have your
*  nutritional bases covered.
*  This is so important, man.
*  There's so many people.
*  You mean checking all the boxes.
*  Yeah.
*  So many people go through life vitamin D deficient.
*  I mean, that is like one of the most common ones.
*  That's one of the big ones with COVID.
*  Yeah.
*  More than 80% of the people in multiple studies, 80% of the people that were in the ICU with
*  COVID had vitamin D deficient levels.
*  Which most of us, I think most of us have.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  Only 4% had sufficient levels.
*  Wow.
*  Which is crazy.
*  Right.
*  So, I mean, that doesn't, you know, correlation and causation.
*  It doesn't exactly mean that vitamin D is going to protect you, but it is.
*  It's crucial for health and it's a vitamin that's actually also, according to Dr. Rhonda
*  Patrick taught me this, that it's also a hormone.
*  You know, and it's, you know, it's something that, it's crucial.
*  And most people don't get it.
*  And if you stay inside all day, you definitely don't get it.
*  And African Americans have an even harder time getting it because their ancestors, yeah,
*  their ancestors developed all this melanin in their skin because they were constantly
*  exposed to sunlight and the melanin was there to protect you from the sunlight.
*  And they didn't have to worry about absorbing the vitamin D because they were out there
*  all the time.
*  Well, as the, you know, as people move into colder climates and climates that are cloudier,
*  that's why people got paler.
*  They got paler because your body became essentially like a fucking giant solar panel for vitamin D.
*  Because you couldn't get it.
*  You needed it.
*  Yeah.
*  You had to, like, look at the people that live in the places where it rains all the time.
*  They're white as fuck.
*  That's why.
*  I mean, it's real simple.
*  It's a survival mechanism for vitamin D.
*  For the one thing.
*  My doctor told me that when he was measuring people, he would measure black folks in New York
*  and some of them had undetectable levels of vitamin D, which is insane.
*  Wow.
*  Because you're in the winter, right?
*  You're covering your body completely.
*  You're not going outside and you're also not supplementing.
*  No.
*  So let's go into diet.
*  So for me, for me, I got into these crazy races and my diet that I believe, hopefully,
*  it wasn't just a mental thing, was more fruits and veggies.
*  And so if I made a food pyramid, the very top of the pyramid would be fish, eggs, and meat.
*  But just 15% of my diet, the rest was like avocado, salad.
*  And I performed fantastic on that diet.
*  That sounds great for you.
*  I mean, in fact-
*  But for me, for me.
*  And you tried different ways.
*  Exactly.
*  You tried like more meat, more fish, less meat, less vegetables.
*  I've tried it all.
*  And this is primarily fruits and vegetables for you.
*  Yeah.
*  Primarily fruits.
*  I would say more veggies.
*  Well, if you think about what you're doing, I mean, it makes sense, right?
*  You're doing a lot of endurance stuff.
*  And a lot of endurance stuff requires a lot of carbohydrates.
*  Also, you're getting a lot of vitamins from all those vegetables, a lot of minerals from
*  all those vegetables.
*  Yeah.
*  Makes sense.
*  And a little bit of meat.
*  And when I did an event in Fiji once, the Fijians are phenomenal rugby players.
*  And we were out in the, like literally in the jungle of Fiji.
*  And animals, these guys are like ripped.
*  And they got the machetes and barefoot.
*  And they're going from like, for them to go to see a friend in another village, it's like
*  a 15 mile hike.
*  And they would kill a cow.
*  They'd eat mostly vegetables, but they would kill a cow once every six months.
*  They eat it all.
*  They eat the eyeballs.
*  Nose and tail.
*  Yeah, everything.
*  Yeah.
*  And they would poke a hole in the cow's neck and like mix a little milk with the blood,
*  drink it up until a point where they killed it.
*  But I would say they were not, they were more veggies than, you know, they'd eat that cow
*  once every six months, but up till then it's like all veggies.
*  And they were, these guys like-
*  Was that because of necessity though?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, because that's what was available.
*  That's available.
*  Yeah.
*  They didn't have Whole Foods or a car or TV or anything.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's real clear that people evolved to adapt to their environments, like
*  whatever their environments were.
*  And if you were living in a plant rich environment and you ate most, look, there's a lot of people
*  that live in the jungles of South America that prefer monkeys.
*  That's like their favorite thing to eat.
*  Yeah.
*  My friend Steve Ronella actually went to Guyana and was hanging out with these tribes and they
*  would kill a monkey and they were so excited and they would smoke the monkey and cook it in a soup.
*  And that was their favorite thing to eat. They preferred it over everything.
*  You eat a monkey?
*  No, I've never eaten a monkey.
*  Yeah, I want a monkey.
*  I don't want to eat a primate.
*  My friend David Cho, who's an artist, was just in Africa and he was staying with a tribe and
*  their primary diet is baboons because they, he sent me some pictures.
*  I don't know if I can use them so I won't post them to you, but he sent me some pictures of
*  these people cooking up baboons. He said that they, people like miners and people that are out there
*  that have killed essentially so many animals in that area. They've depopulated that area so badly
*  that baboons are like the last thing left. So that's what this tribe hunts.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah, right? I don't want to eat a baboon.
*  I'll take a salad. You take a salad over a baboon.
*  Yeah, but if I was, if I needed to survive.
*  You do what you got to do.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to do what you got to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's go back to if you're okay with it.
*  Yeah, let's get out of this darkness.
*  Yeah, let's get out of that.
*  There's something dark about primates, right?
*  Right, yeah. Why is that?
*  Because it's our ancestors. We're related to them in some sort of a strange way.
*  It looks like cannibalism. Like I've read a lot about Native American history
*  and one of the more disturbing things is how prevalent cannibalism was
*  and how prevalent cannibalism was where they would kill their enemies and eat them
*  and roast them over the fire and, you know, and sometimes eat them while they're still alive.
*  You think that was part of like the reward?
*  I don't know, man. Some of it was just survival.
*  I mean, when you're talking about people that evolved first primarily without horses,
*  right? It's like without horses for who knows how many thousands of years until the Europeans came.
*  When the Europeans came, they taught them horseback riding and then they started stealing
*  horses and then they started raising horses and then they started getting better at riding
*  horses and doing battle on horses than any of the Europeans were. Like the Comanches were far
*  better on horseback than any. It's one of the main reasons why the West was so difficult to settle
*  because the Europeans, the settlers only had muskets, single shot, take you like, you know,
*  30 seconds to fucking reload, whereas the Comanches can unload 30 arrows in that time,
*  you know, in probably 30 seconds, probably more. They probably unload 40 or 50 arrows in 30 seconds.
*  Yeah, and you're dead. You're fucked. And they could fight on horseback. The Europeans hadn't
*  figured out how to fight on horseback. They would climb off the horse to aim the rifle and then
*  shoot it and then they'd have to reload and the Comanches just run up on them and shoot from
*  horseback. So the idea that these people who grew up in this place or evolved in this place where
*  they didn't have horses, they ate whatever the fuck they could. They came here on foot from Asia,
*  right? And a lot of them came through the Bering Strait. Like they ate whatever they could.
*  Yeah, right. It was survival.
*  And if you had a war with a neighboring tribe and you killed them, that's a lot of good meat.
*  We got a lot of meat there.
*  Yeah, what are you going to do? You're going to just let it rot? Or you could just eat them
*  and come up with some reason why you're stealing their soul or whatever it is, cook them over fire.
*  I got a saying that's fire ready aim rather than, you know, aim ready fire. And it sounds like you've
*  got a lot of knowledge in this area, but my thinking is aim ready fire came from like,
*  took 30 seconds to load. Like you don't want to miss that shot. Right. Right. But today
*  we've got the ability to like shoot a lot. If you use it as an example in business or whatever,
*  like fucking take shots, right? Whereas the mindset I think is slow down, aim,
*  but you never take the shot because you talk yourself out of it. I'm not going to start this
*  business. I'm not going to do this new job. I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to do that.
*  I just take lots of fucking shots.
*  Well, that seems like it's going to suit your personality though. Right. Yeah. I think some
*  people are more calculated and more German, perhaps more German slowly engineer this situation,
*  figure out how to do it right. And what what's feasible and what's not feasible. You know,
*  I think the idea that's important is action. Do things. Yes, actually do things to procrastinate
*  and sit around and debate things forever before anything gets done. Yeah. There's a, there's a
*  proper balance though of enough action and enough thinking. But if you, if you, if you get ready
*  and you're aiming, you don't tend to get into action. When I fire, right? When I, when I tell
*  somebody to fire first and commit to that event, that boxing, right? It sends, it sends things into
*  motion. Like all of a sudden now you're doing a bunch of shit because fuck you said you were
*  starting a business next month. Right. Right. Oh, I can see that. Yeah. Especially if you're not
*  doing anything currently. Yeah. The problem is like how much like the people that do too many
*  things, that's almost as bad as not doing enough things. That's fair. You get spread too thin.
*  I would be, if you, if you, if you were my coach, you'd say I do a little too many things. Do you
*  think you do too many things? I do too many things. Yeah. So what, what makes you know that,
*  but yet continue to do it? I just need, like, why would I possibly throw a kids camp in the
*  mix during COVID? I got 300 events. I got to reschedule across 45 countries. Do you test the
*  kids? Like, how'd you, how'd you do that? Nope. Just reached out to a bunch of men. That sounds terrible. You gotta test them, man. How come you didn't test them?
*  I, I, yeah, I fire ready aim. I am. But do you worry about health consequences? A bunch of kids getting sick?
*  We're making it sound much worse than it is. They woke up early, big deal, every fucking year. But I'm
*  not worried about that. I'm worried about they're all be together and they're all, I mean, we're in
*  a pandemic. Oh, test them that way. I'm sorry. I thought you meant, I thought you meant test them physically. Oh, no, no, no, I meant test them. Yes, of course. Yes. Okay.
*  I thought you meant like how many pushups did they do? No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I used it. I didn't,
*  wasn't very specific. We test the shit out of people here. Yeah. We get tested every week and we're
*  constantly tested. But when you did my test, when I came in, it was with a rusty knife. I thought that was a little weird.
*  That's how we do it now. We're tired. We're tired of doing it with clean utensils. What, what's your feeling on COVID?
*  Well, it's, it's clearly a real problem. I mean, clearly very contagious. And for some people, it's no big deal. They shake it off. Pro athletes seem to have very little problem with it. Like a lot of NBA players. Although I do know of one NBA player that got it. He's 28 years old. And he got it three months ago. And he still is not back
*  up to the endurance level that he was before he got it. And he's still having lung issues. Wow. Yeah. It's a fucking rare. That's rare though, right? It's rare. Yeah. But I mean, you could be one of those rare ones, right? It's a fucking weird disease, man. And I think one of the reasons why it's a rare disease is probably because it was manipulated in a lab. You think Wuhan? Yeah. I mean, I don't know, right? But when I talked to my friend, Brett Weinstein, who is a biologist, he explained scientifically that all that there's all these points,
*  all these things you could point to about this virus that indicated it's been manipulated, that it evolved too quickly. The jump from animals to humans is too quick. And that this specific type of virus, they were working on it in that lab. They had a level four lab in Wuhan. It's more likely, he said, given the what we know about the virus, that it was released or escaped or accidentally released from that lab. A couple of military guys I spoke to think it escaped. They don't think it was. Yeah.
*  But I mean, China's pretty pissed off at us, right? I mean, whether it's justified or not, we're in a battle.
*  But I mean, they didn't release it in America. They released it on their own people. I don't think they released it on purpose. I think that would be really creepy. And I think if they were going to do that, they would be really calculated and they would release it.
*  And they would do it in Manhattan, and then vaccinate their own people and then fuck up our economy. And that could have happened. Not this time, but I mean, that is a possibility.
*  It shows you what is possible.
*  Yeah, exactly. That's what I meant. That's like a civilization could engineer a pandemic and infect another civilization.
*  So powerful as a weapon. Oh my God. Look what it crippled the whole world.
*  Crippled the whole world, crippled our economy.
*  Like that.
*  And we are the worst at it. If you look at all the other countries, no one's done a worse job at dealing with this pandemic than us.
*  You think it exposed, I think it exposed our weaknesses.
*  Sure. Our health weaknesses, our financial weaknesses, exposed a lot of our weaknesses.
*  Yeah, a little riff now. And right, like, you know, there's shit going on.
*  Well, you know, that was, there's, that's like a bunch of compounding factors, right? You know, you have the George Floyd murder, and then you have the protests afterwards, which ignite
*  most likely is one of the factors in the kick up of the virus again, the second wave of it.
*  You know, there's a lot going on, you know, and then also people don't like to be told what to do here.
*  So, well, I fuck you. I'm going to go out. Fuck you. I'm going to spring break. Fuck you. I'm going to Florida.
*  Fuck you. I'm not wearing a mask.
*  I am. We got a call. I took the approach of we could put on a safe event.
*  The second that I get a state or a country that allows us to put on an event, we're back on and we're going to put protocols in place because
*  I believe, fight me on it if I don't know what your thoughts are, but I believe that you're more likely to get like we're sitting right now as opposed to being outside.
*  And I want people healthy. That's pretty much established. You're more likely to get it inside.
*  Sunlight kills it. And then the people have said, well, if sunlight kills it, then the protest, it wouldn't have spread in the protest.
*  Like, not so fast. You're talking about 50,000 people packed on top of each other screaming.
*  The idea that the sunlight is going to kill all of it seems ridiculous.
*  Like, and it's also going to get into people and they're going to bring it to their home and it's going to get to them.
*  They're going to go to work. They're going to give it to other people at work or other people, wherever gatherings that they get to.
*  Whenever you get you're having like the way someone described it recently, it's like a music festival in every city all across the country for weeks at a time.
*  And that's what the protests were like. I'm sure it had an impact.
*  And if you looked at the numbers, like so many of the people that have it now are young people.
*  I think bars had a big impact on it, too. I think a lot of, you know, drunk talk and bars right on top of each other.
*  You're indoors. You're drinking. Your inhibitions are down. You're not thinking. You're not washing your hands.
*  You're yelling. You're, you know, you're talking loud.
*  Sloppy.
*  Sloppy. Yeah.
*  So so we get a call from Florida.
*  Florida doesn't give a fuck.
*  Florida doesn't give a fuck. Jacksonville.
*  I was definitely on the side of you said, Joe, what's your stance on the whole thing?
*  My stance was I think we should shut down for a period of time to get the hospitals and our medical system like in shape.
*  But I'm just not a believer that you could shut down an economy for as long as we have.
*  Like it has an effect. It has some negative consequences.
*  It's got a big negative.
*  It's got right. Like people people lose their shit sitting indoors.
*  Like forget about money and everything else. You start to lose your mind.
*  Yeah.
*  Right. So so I'm putting a race on.
*  I decide we're shooting down there.
*  We put all the protocols in place.
*  I'm a little annoyed because it's not going to be the race I'm used to where everybody's like like you're getting together in the festival area and I can't have like mud pits where we're mingling people.
*  So I don't know how it's going to go.
*  I drive with my family because I got to be there if I'm if I'm the leader of this organ.
*  I got to be there driving my family down the East Coast.
*  When I get to South Carolina there's no virus.
*  There's like corn dogs and partying and like beaches full of people all the way to Florida.
*  There was no it was completely different than New York and everywhere else.
*  Like it was game on.
*  So it's not shocking that the virus is huge down there.
*  Yes.
*  The virus.
*  You know they said Florida if it was a country would be the fourth highest rate of infection in the entire world.
*  I got to tell you and I'm not self-serving we put on a good safe event really good event and so far that knock on wood no issues but like there was no protection no protocol nothing down in the states down there.
*  Do you impose tests on the.
*  We did tests all all of our employees we tested with the swap that you know touches your brain with the swab unlike your your rusty knife on my hand.
*  Did you temperature checks.
*  The temperature checks with everybody we kept everybody distance.
*  I'm not I'm not just saying it because like my team went overboard right it was annoying to me at how at how good they did it and can't make money like that because I can't I can't get enough people in the event to right I got to space them out and.
*  How many people did you normally have an event.
*  Normally we'd have eight thousand at that event called a couple of thousand so I can't I can't make those numbers work but I thought it was important because there's fifty thousand events around the world that are shut down New York Marathon Boston go down the list and if we could provide like a path to hey this could be done.
*  It was important to do but it's not fifty thousand events have been shut down fifty thousand around the world.
*  That crazy we are the hardest hit industry because we're not like a restaurant where I could deliver food like I'm dead.
*  Dead out of business right right I got to keep paying people.
*  So how many events do you normally run a year three twenty five forty five countries three hundred and twenty five events and I'm down I'll be lucky I'll be lucky if we have twenty this year.
*  Twenty from three twenty five so three hundred and five down down tough tough year I wonder when this is going to turn around do you think it's going to take a vaccine I mean I'm looking at Sweden I don't know what your feeling is on Sweden but I.
*  Thank to that warrior call we spoke about at the very beginning of this conversation where I had all the people from around the world chiming in.
*  It looks it looks to me I know people are going to listen to this and say Joe you're crazy.
*  Sweden's got the more deaths the Norway and other Nordic countries but but when you look at the charts you look at the number of people infected in Sweden versus the number of people dying like.
*  And no one should die I'm not suggesting anybody should die but like it looks like it worked its way through the system and they didn't shut down now granted they're in good shape unlike us right sweet sweets are in good shape.
*  They socially distance anyway they keep their distance not like us they're not hugging as much as we do and shaking hands but looks like it worked.
*  They also have a different society over there like they're they're they mostly have small villages you know you have Sweden you have Stockholm.
*  It's a little spread out yeah it's like you have some some urban areas but you have a lot of areas that are spread out and they're small villages.
*  Yeah no it's very little more like Vermont yeah exactly and Vermont has almost no cases really yeah yeah it's just not a high population of people.
*  No but but maybe I'm an optimist I'm a very optimistic guy maybe this thing's just got to work its way through because even if you get a vaccine.
*  I happen to be close with a gentleman that's invested in one of these companies coming out with the vaccine Moderna and even if you get the vaccine this year let's just say right you get it.
*  You know how Americans are with vaccines they don't even want to take the flu shot right so is everybody going to all of a sudden take the vaccine or do we just have to stay shut for another year like you can't.
*  The only way out of this again people are going to be pissed off the only way out is just get on with our lives.
*  Well the thing that I've been harping on maybe too much is that there's no emphasis whatsoever from our government about taking care of your health.
*  I'm the number one proponent I mean come on that's what I live for.
*  I know it but it's weird that there's no discussion of this at all because they're afraid of shaming people for being obese they're afraid of shaming people because their diet you know so they've avoided the discussion completely.
*  That were me if you were president okay and I was your advisor.
*  We'd be fucked.
*  This world's fucked now president Joe and vice president Joe.
*  You're president problems.
*  I'm your advisor and tell me what you agree with or disagree with one let's get everybody to bed early everybody's going to bed early.
*  No freedom I'm all for freedom again I go back to Stephen King that that motherfucker wrote some great shit doing freedom drinking like a fish.
*  But freedom leads to Doritos and it leads to also leads to Carrie.
*  Great works of art.
*  How do we get both.
*  You don't you get freedom you get both because of freedom you know you give people freedom and you get a lot of things.
*  You know this is the problem with this disease is this is not like anything else you know I mean you can't compare it to the flu you can't because it's clearly more infectious.
*  And there's you know there's flu shots people can even if you have a flu shot and it's for the wrong strain of the flu there's enough.
*  In that that will protect you at least a certain amount from whatever flu.
*  There's nothing like that for this so all you got is vitamins and nutrients and health and sleeping.
*  So when you say all right let's get him healthy you're president and you want freedom which I agree with freedom.
*  But freedom has led to like when I lived in Japan and I land anywhere in the United States doesn't matter what airport I land in people are three times the size.
*  I don't want to say that about my American brothers and sisters but like yeah three times the fucking size.
*  True yeah I lived in Vancouver come back to America three times the size.
*  Yeah I lived in Singapore come back to America three times the size like we got a problem.
*  We do but that's also look the American diet is terrible the average American diet is terrible.
*  I mean eating milkshakes and fries and soda and the massive amounts of sugar is what's led to people being enormous.
*  The massive amounts of calories and sedentary lifestyle it's all terrible.
*  But it's not all of us I mean look how many people are in the CrossFit look how many people are in Jiu Jitsu.
*  Look how many people are in the percentage though it's a small percentage but that's what freedom gets you.
*  There's a small percentage of people that are going to excel.
*  I mean that's just part of that's part of the recipe of exceptionalism.
*  You're going to give people the ability to do whatever the fuck they want.
*  You're going to have some people that are going to ruin their lives because of that.
*  Have an open mind to this one I'm not saying this is right I beat this up.
*  What if your president and I whispered in your ear and I said all right
*  Joe if you won't accept getting rid of the Doritos can we at least have an FDA that's not
*  in other words a department that just doesn't allow factory farming doesn't allow bullshit
*  foods maybe puts a sugar tax on things. Okay factory farming I think should be a crime
*  because I think it's a crime against nature. I think what they do to those pigs when you see pigs
*  stuffed into those cages standing their own shit and then the shit and piss gets filtered out into
*  a giant pond that's outside of it filled with methane. Can't even drive by it. Can't drive it
*  the smell is horrific right that that's a crime that's a crime and that's a crime they're letting
*  them get away with because it's profitable that's what I think. So how so again how do you have
*  laws to protect them they have ag gag laws so if you're working there you can't film this if you
*  work in there and you're horrified by it and you film it you are in trouble because they don't want
*  anybody seeing that exactly if you see that you're not gonna eat like you and I don't want to eat the
*  baboon exactly so so what do we do how do we stop it well that there should be laws against there
*  should be laws against that and that that is part of what fuels fast food because in order to get
*  cheap meat you're gonna have to do something you're gonna have to figure out a way to stuff
*  these animals into these pens and you're gonna have to maximize your profit and that's that's how
*  that's how it got to the position that it's in right now it should have never gotten there but now
*  that it's there and now we know about it we got to pull it back and if that means that these fast food
*  places are gonna have to jack up prices and they're gonna have to use organic free-range beef and
*  instead of you know these the shit that they're serving people now well then that's what's gonna
*  have to happen and if things are more expensive then people realize well this stuff is better
*  for you but now it costs more you know what I can go to the supermarket and I can get it cheaper
*  and I could cook it myself and I can and maybe we could wean people off of this fast food the idea
*  that we have to eat fast food is fucking crazy but then you've got people that live in these poor
*  neighborhoods and you know you can get a Big Mac for what a couple bucks and it'll fill you up
*  that was gonna be my next question so so I like it I like what you're saying so now all of a sudden
*  it's cheap it's more expensive at Burger King McDonald's or Pizza Hut whatever right it drives
*  people to make their own food but but a lot of the neighborhoods which is a large part of America
*  can't afford it how do you solve that that's a good question that's a real good question I mean
*  that's the the real problem is poverty right the real problem is and the real problem is these
*  impoverished neighborhoods that have been like that forever and it does they don't seem to be
*  changing how do you fix that especially now when people can't work you know this this is a real
*  problem right now things are not just stagnant they're deteriorating because people can't work
*  so um um um in our little game we're playing I'm your advisor you know tell me go fuck myself but
*  there's a lot of generals and colonels and folks from the military that retire each year and what
*  if we took all those inner cities those tough those tough neighborhoods and we said hey you got
*  you had a great career you're retired you're getting paid to the end of your life go take
*  over that neighborhood clean it up would that be viewed by the public as like a military state
*  certainly would I mean look what's going on in Portland yeah you know in Portland they sent the
*  department of homeland security to try to break up the riots and uh they're calling them riots now
*  finally you know why because the Portland mayor got tear gas and they told him to fuck himself like
*  kids were yelling at him fuck you retire step down yeah well yeah he's like oh this is great
*  because he thought I'm gonna be I'm gonna be one of the people and I'm gonna go there they were
*  throwing water bottles at him I don't know what they want I don't know what they want but they
*  were telling him you've got to resign fuck you mayor it's crazy and then the the department of
*  homeland security people were masoning him they they so how do you solve how do you how do you go
*  I mean you gotta use the military I just don't think that's that I just don't think you could do
*  that I mean look what they're trying to do in Portland is a different story because you're
*  trying to break up looting smashing windows attacks on federal property that's sort of a different
*  thing and I don't I don't think I don't really I'm not educated enough to decide nor have I really
*  sat down thought about it whether or not they need a department of homeland security to break
*  that stuff up I don't know what's going on up there but I do know that the mayor who is in
*  support of what he was calling peaceful protest is now like okay this is a riot yeah yeah I mean
*  they were screaming at him like he's the guy that's on their side he let antifa take over the streets
*  and they're throwing water bottles at him yeah they're like fuck you yeah I mean I don't think
*  you would I'm not a believer you're not I don't think you're a believer and like you can't let
*  people do illegal things I don't care what it's for you can't let people destroy property you
*  also can't let people like these mass gatherings have become violent and they think they're doing
*  it for a good cause but it's totally directionless like what are they trying to do they're trying to
*  take over the federal court buildings what are they trying to do like look what happened in
*  Seattle where they took over those six blocks the chas area look what happened in there they started
*  beating people up people got shot and killed they wouldn't let anybody in they put borders up they
*  developed their own security system and then when people were violating that they were kicking their
*  ass they were literally physically assaulting people in the name of this new utopia like they
*  did a way shittier job of governing that spot that America does the it feels like Hong Kong
*  it's just everything we saw in Hong Kong yeah it's fucking chaos out there in some of these
*  especially the Pacific Northwest and I wonder how much that has to do with they don't get any sun
*  could be vitamin D could go back to vitamin D that's part of why they're so depressed up
*  there that's been documented that's why depression I mean seasonal of depression disorder that's up
*  there man so so so what do we do with the Doritos and let them have it you have Doritos you can't
*  put a sugar tax or no no no no you should educate people look I don't eat Doritos yeah well how
*  come other people do they well I mean I'll have them occasionally I don't have them occasionally
*  but I don't I don't meet them every day if I did I'd be fat it's real simple
*  but we don't say this you know like and the do you think it's a discussion problem sure yeah look how
*  much time do we spend talking about certain issues that we have whatever whatever those issues are
*  and how little time do we spend how little time does our own government spend talking to us about
*  our diet talking to us about like the literally one of the most important things even doctors don't
*  talk about our diet they don't know anything about it the amount of time that the average
*  physician spends in medical school studying nutrition is miniscule it's tiny unless that
*  person's actually studied unless their their actual education is in nutrition there's very
*  little studying of it when when if you're a doctor that's a general practitioner if you're a doctor
*  that's an orthopedic surgeon how much time unless you're independently studying it how much time in
*  medical school do they spend studying nutrition very little which is crazy because that's the
*  root cause of most of these diseases yep right up but we fix problems we don't find the source of
*  the problems and solve them yeah it's but some people do so for those some people you know you
*  can learn from those some people and there's a ton of them out there but those inner cities might
*  not be getting that information they're not they're not so how do they do have cheap food in the form
*  of fast food and it's everywhere and also provides jobs for people that live there
*  so do you subsidize that man i don't know man it's a good idea it's it's it's a real good
*  question the problem is people are addicted to those foods too so you'd have to get them off of
*  that when you see someone who's obese almost always they're addicted to some sort of terrible
*  food almost always i know you love freedom and i love freedom that's why we both live in this
*  country but it's not a fair fight if if i'm not against i'm not a conspiracy guy or but like i was
*  on wall street and if you're a burger king you're one of these big public companies that's making
*  food that's not so healthy like you got scientists you got madison avenue advertisers you figured out
*  a way to get into our psyche yeah where you can't live without that thing yeah right so that's not a
*  fair fight yeah and they're they're in there and they're not getting out right but they used to be
*  able to advertise for cigarettes they can't do that anymore they they stopped that it's interesting
*  because you can still advertise for like jack in the box but you can't advertise for cigarettes
*  but obesity kills as many people as almost anything so that's what i'm saying would you cross the line
*  of like were you annoyed that you can't advertise for cigarettes is that taking away a freedom
*  it's a good question it's a discussion the problem with those those ads is a lot of them were at
*  least initially very deceptive you know they made it look like marlboro man yeah marlboro man i
*  wanted i wanted i wanted to be more yeah right the guy died of cancer by the way um so i mean
*  there's no ads where you see these shitty foods um with obese people getting sick no no right they're
*  making you feel good yeah i wonder if like for every good ad you would have to have a bad ad
*  like you'd have an ad i like that like so like whatever good ad for bird king had you could
*  hire like a company that would make a creative very compelling ad showing fat people having
*  heart attacks and literally like eating shit or even or even a motivating one to do something
*  healthy yeah that would be better right the the best motivation is always positive right but
*  sometimes not for some people particularly for people that are addicted sometimes the wakeup
*  calls death door you get to death's door you have that heart attack you're like oh my god i gotta
*  fucking clean up my life ct yeah right and you know i mean i think ct had underlying um genetic
*  genetic conditions which many many people do have it's not even their fault they just have uh for
*  whatever reason they just have a history a genetic history of heart disease but heart disease is very
*  weird but it certainly is exacerbated and he'll tell you that by his diet yes that that was the
*  doesn't mean you're definitely gonna die because your parents did of that right you could you could
*  make some lifestyle choices yes yes you could strengthen your health for sure in in multiple
*  ways yeah what's a typical day look like for you from a health and wellness standpoint like like
*  um well i'm lucky that i enjoy doing things it's healthy things yeah and i because your background
*  yeah so because i have this long history of exercise it's like it's just a normal part of
*  my day and if i don't do it i don't think right like if i don't do it i'm not calm it's so it
*  fucks up everything else so it'll fuck up podcast for me when i was doing stand up before covid it
*  was would fuck up stand up like you can't be in a bad mood like you can't and for me the best
*  solution to a bad mood is hard workouts yeah hard workouts cure it all man a heavy bag smoke a joint
*  hit that heavy bag play some hendrix just whack the shit out of that heavy bag and then after it's
*  over man i feel great i love everybody doesn't the smoke in the joint doesn't slow you down
*  it gives you gives you energy no it just makes me reflective makes me think more makes me paranoid
*  it makes me uh more compassionate there's like there's a lot of weird stuff about pot and one
*  of the things that people don't like is like oh my god i just feel paranoid like i think that's
*  hyper aware that's what it is like because really you should kind of be more paranoid than you really
*  are i mean we're these water balloons of flesh with these fucking breakable sticks that keep the
*  structure together i'm wandering around driving 60 miles an hour in these metal boxes with rubber
*  tires over this artificial road that we've created and covered the earth with we're fucking weird man
*  pretty complacent yeah when you describe it that way and we're in space and we're on this ball that's
*  spinning a thousand miles an hour hurling through it towards infinity a fire burning every day the
*  sun and we're not going to be here for very long you know that's the other thing you have a short
*  amount of time here and you're trying to navigate this time the best you can trying to be nice and
*  have be a good friend and be a good neighbor and be a good husband and a father and all those good
*  things and a big good wife and just a a nice co-worker and you're trying to just do your best
*  it's complicated and you're you're interacting with all these different people with all sorts
*  of different issues and problems and needs and wants and desires and egos and there's a lot
*  going on man and the more that you can mitigate your own stress levels the more that you can
*  calm the demons inside you the better you're going to interact with people the better they're going
*  to feel about their interactions with you the better they're going to interact with other people
*  there's a ripple effect and it just it makes the whole world better like if you're a better person
*  have you if you do your best and you get better at it and you keep doing your best you keep getting
*  better at it like all things in life you do better at creating a healthy environment for all the
*  people around you too when you say it that way it's like if everybody in america exercised you know
*  20 minutes a day 30 right it'd be a better world 100 right 100 everybody get along a little better
*  yeah i don't think there's any denying that i mean for some people wouldn't work oh yeah well my dad
*  worked out 20 minutes a day he's still a dick that's the outlier but the way if you looked at
*  the mean if you looked at overall like if you you got 330 million people or whatever we've got in
*  this country and all of them worked out 20 minutes a day and then you looked at like what what the
*  results were two three years down the road i would imagine you would have less aggressive behavior
*  you would have probably less violent crime you'd probably have less arguments people could be more
*  peaceful about things you'd probably have people that were healthier they'd have less visits to the
*  doctor they'd have less medical problems i bet there would be overall a host of benefits that
*  we would achieve nationwide if we could convince people and i'm not talking about taking a fucking
*  brutal crossfit class or going to jujitsu and getting strangled every day i'm talking about
*  going on a hike and doing some push-ups and sit-ups some bodyweight squats very basic basic stuff
*  basic stuff i've met enough as you have i've met enough we'll call them killers from martial arts
*  where they're very humble very nice and me not coming from that background i'm shocked right
*  because i'm expecting a pit bull but i'm getting a golden retriever yeah and and i think it's
*  because they work out every day and they've been humbled and they do hard work and so it takes the
*  edge off yeah it's also they don't have a need to prove themselves yeah they know what they can do
*  and they don't they're not trying to puff their chest out and like intimidate everyone around them
*  they're friendly they're like most like jujitsu is a perfect example of that because jujitsu
*  there's only one way to excel at jujitsu you have to spar so you can't pretend you have to be in
*  there getting strangled or strangling people every day you become humble that's you get humble it
*  happens i mean i don't know how many times i've tapped out but it's a lot it's thousands and you
*  got to make that decision at that moment it's gonna happen especially like if you want to get
*  a black belt you start with a white belt that means you're gonna get fucked up i mean there's
*  just no way around it but there's there's great lessons in learning there's like you start like
*  you you get in your blue belt you're like i'm getting really good at this and you roll with
*  some purple belt smashes you know like fuck i'm terrible and then you get your purple belt you're
*  like i'm doing pretty good some brown belt fucking squashes you you're like fuck like there's there's
*  you know it's just like you try to always being level level yeah i like that then there's there's
*  always room to grow and learn you don't want to be the master you want to be the guy who's seeking
*  to improve because there is no real i mean there are masters there's guys that are at such a high
*  level that unless they run into another master they're gonna they're gonna do the squash in
*  but then they've trained with those other masters they train with each other all the time and you
*  know it's it's beautiful to watch you know like really high level guys tap each other out and you
*  realize like this never ends this never never ends yeah helsen gracey has a very famous description
*  of jujitsu jujitsu is like i do this to you you respond i respond to your response that goes on
*  forever forever that's jujitsu i like that i attack you defend i attack you defend forever forever
*  that's jujitsu i like that yeah given that you're president again couldn't couldn't we do what isreal
*  does couldn't we have one year it doesn't have to be military it's not a bad idea right yeah one
*  year just kick everybody's ass for one year it's not a bad idea the problem with that is again the
*  freedom thing you want people to be able to do whatever they want but you also get a lot of
*  service out of your country right you get a lot there's a lot that we all benefit from from having
*  a fire department and a military and clean streets and sanitation and all the different the fire
*  department takes care of everybody's fire right the police you call 911 theoretically they show
*  up to help you that's something we all pay for we all this is a something that brings us together
*  as a society and what what separates israel i think first of all israel is surrounded by people
*  that they're in conflict with so they feel like they have to have that but the fact that they have
*  this mandatory military service they're very proud people and there's a lot of patriotism
*  when it comes to israel some would say that's bad some some people would say that's bad some
*  people would say that's good um i i i think there's real benefit to some form of service i don't know
*  if it has to be military service i don't know what it has to be like the bonding that probably
*  occurs the same thing with our events but but um every culture has had a rite of passage we don't
*  we don't like i'm doing it with these children on it like we need it yes i think human beings do need
*  a rite of passage i think that is important and you know these these traditional uh cultures that
*  have had these rites of passage that's to signify that someone is coming of age this is an adult now
*  you've gone through this process and this is a like a belt ceremony you know like you get your
*  black belt man they tie that around your waist like that is a moment that you'll never forget
*  you graduate yeah you graduated you made it and i think as an adult like sometimes people have to
*  know i am an adult now i'm held to a different standard i need to hold myself to a different
*  standard i can't just fucking be a ne'er do well and and fucking skip my way through this life and
*  live off of uh unemployment and fuck people over and scan my way through life no i'm i want to be
*  noble i want to be respectable i want to be someone who i respect i would want to respect
*  yeah you want to respect yourself you want to appreciate yourself you know and i think that
*  it's hard to do that it's easy to do nothing but it's hard to do nothing because if you do nothing
*  you're gonna live a hard life it's gonna be a sucky life you don't realize it like but everybody
*  pays you pay no matter what either you pay now or you pay with regret you pay with a lack of success
*  you pay with a sloppy body and a fucking weak mind that falls apart in any challenge you don't
*  have any structure you don't even know rigidity to your thoughts you don't have any resolve in
*  your mindset because you've never been tested and a person who goes through life without ever been
*  tested is a sad person the saddest thing is seeing a person who's never been tested when the shit
*  hits the fan and that's one of the things we're seeing from covid we're seeing a lot of people
*  that are just have weak minds and they're just panicking and screaming at people wear a mask
*  people on the other side of the street and and then you know because they never face tough times
*  yes they've no they don't know they don't know how to buckle up they don't know how to strap in
*  they don't know how to overcome you know and and so this heightened stress level that comes with
*  the pandemic is freaking them the fuck out and that's one of the reasons why social media is
*  such a fucking shithole right now it's so bad it's because so many of those people are shut-ins so
*  many of those people are shut-ins have never been challenged they don't really know who they are you
*  know we're saying like when you do a race you meet yourself these people never met themselves
*  now i know so all they're doing is judging other people constantly bitching and bickering about
*  other people you can learn a lot from someone about how much attention they spend on other
*  people's failures how much time they spend pointing out other people's failures and how little time
*  they spend reflecting on their own yeah no that's what we we think about our business we say we
*  shine a mirror in your face right yeah you get to find out by the way anybody could be good when
*  times are good yes yes right yeah you gotta i mean that's what i like about physical pursuits man
*  you you find out who the fuck you are you know you find out whether or not you're that person who can
*  keep going whether you're that person who who is consistent so many people they start off like i'm
*  gonna run a mile a day and they run a mile a day for a couple weeks and they fuck off
*  you know it's consistency this showing up when you don't want to show up forcing yourself to do
*  things you don't want to but then reaping the rewards and learning like if you just worked out
*  every time you felt motivated you're not gonna ever really get in shape no you're not going to
*  no it's got to be disciplined you gotta have discipline motivation's great i love it i love
*  music i love uh watching a david coggins clip online or cam haines or or or jaco willink or any
*  of these savages there's so many people out there you can you could watch one of their videos where
*  they tell you what to do and you just get fired up and you want to go do but that's not always
*  going to be there for you no sometimes you got to just you got to just the box is what i'm doing
*  every day yeah you get rain or shine doing it this is what i do this is what i do no i agree i agree
*  with that i um i love the fact that you're spreading it that's what i love i love the
*  fact that you're forcing these kids to do these things and then you you're putting together these
*  races where it gives people a destination it gives people an opportunity to train for an event
*  and that's big man events are big for us and you'll appreciate this one this is for most people i
*  mean we get pre-covid 1.6 million people a year doing these events okay it's a big number
*  and this is the biggest thing they've ever done this is their belt ceremony right right this is
*  the olympics they just became a navy seal right right right and and um all the benefits you talk
*  like you can't even believe the transformations that happen to all these people and the letters
*  i get and like i get paid in that currency right like you change my life i'm back with my husband
*  i'm back with my wife i lost weight i gave up drugs i i got a thought what if you put together
*  like an online thing where the people are accountable but because of covid you like you
*  you tell them that event is going to happen the event is going to take place in six weeks
*  and this is what you need to do and then you need to mark your time and every day maybe you yeah
*  maybe you have an app or maybe even simpler they just use a fucking timer on their phone you know
*  and say okay you know ready set start start your timer and then you have to complete all these
*  things and maybe you have a checklist on your website where they can check off all the different
*  things that they have to do during that day and get it done and maybe someone like that 600 pound
*  dude takes him seven hours and the average person takes him 90 minutes but everybody does it together
*  and then as a community they all report it put it up on instagram maybe with hashtags little ranking
*  yeah yeah i like it yeah give someone up give these people an event without having a physical
*  look i mean look there's probably nothing better than that physical location when you all get
*  together and you all the camaraderie and the energy of all the people together running together and
*  it's not the same we did it we did a very big virtual event what you're saying we registered
*  3.9 million people in his virtual event but i don't know how many did i you know what i mean
*  right and then and then what i like what you just said was i didn't have the lead up every day did
*  you do your 100 push-ups i like i like that part yeah that's the part that excites me yeah right
*  but a virtual event you could kind of get away with cheating like in the sense that you cheat
*  yourself you and i know that you gotta tell them that too just let them know no but if you and i
*  if we were signed up for september 1st we're going to do a spartan we're gonna we gotta show up and
*  you don't want to be embarrassed i don't want to be embarrassed like but with the virtual you could
*  kind of hide behind your couch yeah i did right so that means you might not do the push-ups but i
*  like i still like the idea because maybe 50 000 people every day will do it right it's something
*  and it'll do it'll have an effect i agree that it won't have as big an effect as if you're doing
*  it live i think the way you do it live is awesome and that's that's the best effect but you know you
*  got to do what you got to do when times change yeah it'll come back yeah right i mean hopefully
*  i never thought this was gonna happen and what's the story you moving i'm out of here yeah when do
*  you leave soon texas or yeah i'm gonna go to texas i got a farm in vermont yeah it's a little cold
*  it's cold i i i just want to go somewhere in the center of the country somewhere it's easier to
*  travel to both places and somewhere where you have a little bit more freedom also i think that um
*  where we live right here in los angeles is overcrowded and i think most of the time that's
*  not a problem but i think it's exposing the fact that it's a real issue when you look at the number
*  of pieces people that uh are catching covid because of this overpopulation issue when you look at the
*  traffic when you look at the economic despair when you look at the homelessness problem that's
*  accelerated radically over the last uh six seven ten years i think there's too many people here i
*  think it's not tenable i don't i don't think it's manageable and i think every mayor does a
*  shit job of doing it because i don't think anybody could do a great job of it i think there's like
*  certain things you're gonna have to deal with when you have a population of whatever the fuck la is
*  it's like 20 million plus people too many people it's too many people yeah that's what i think i
*  think where you're living is probably the perfect way to do it it's 500 people that's nuts but then
*  you got those uh dudes yelling at you where's the deer you understand the language i could go on we
*  could do hours of the negatives of a small town oh yeah there's negatives everybody knows your
*  business yeah yeah everybody knows what you're doing where you're going you know there's pros
*  and cons to everything but i think uh i think you have a better opportunity at more pros when
*  there's less folks i agree so so small town texas or let's just leave it at that yeah i got ideas
*  jamey's coming nice we got him he's all excited it doesn't affect the business no we're just
*  gonna do it from there but that's the other thing is texas has comedy they have stand-up comedy i've
*  been doing i did well i haven't been doing but i did one weekend in texas while all this was going
*  on it was the first weekend i was able to do stand-up but then my friends were in san antonio and
*  they got covid down there but those knuckleheads were out there talking to people and shaking hands
*  and taking pictures and stuff and texas would be the last stand place to ever wear a mask or not
*  shake a hand they wear masks though people are wearing masks last time i was there i think now
*  they're woken up right well this is a weird disease man it's weird you know it's it's super
*  con but now again i was talking to a neuroscientist yesterday was saying the latest is they don't think
*  asymptomatic or asymptomatic people are contagious and i'm like well what the fuck man i thought they
*  were i thought that's part of the problem yeah now that now they've never got something else they
*  don't know they don't know they don't know if you can catch it twice they don't know i heard that's
*  coming out now they think you can then they say it's very unlikely antibodies are going away
*  and yeah they don't know they don't know you prefer stand up over this i like all the things i do
*  yeah yeah i mean scary scary getting up on stage it's exciting it's not scary
*  not anymore the first time i did it was scary uh you know after after you develop a certain
*  amount of proficiency you know what's scary or what's nerve-wracking is when you release a special
*  like i'll do a netflix special and then i have a whole new hour after right and it's all new
*  material that's all because everybody's seen it yeah so now that's scary because then you're going
*  on stage all these people pay to see you they're all excited they think you're hilarious and you
*  got nothing right so you have to write a lot and you have to work it out but just exciting it's
*  more exciting i prefer the word exciting it's exciting it's challenging a show like netflix
*  when you did that for an hour how how many pages of material is that well it takes about two years
*  it takes a year yeah it takes really a year to write it and then a year to polish it and then add
*  new stuff to it and really figure out where it is but uh you know each bit is many many pages
*  it depends you know really it depends on the bit it depends on you know how how i mean a lot of it
*  gets chopped i mean maybe i'll start out with like 10 pages and then i chop it down to one and then
*  the actual bit becomes one page but how many pages did it take to get correct the bit or to re-edit
*  and try it again and a second draft a third draft and are you testing it in front of people as you
*  have to you have to yeah you stand up you have to test in front of an live audience you you write
*  sometimes i write bits and they are finished before they ever get to the stage and they're done like
*  the moment i bring them to the stage they're already done but that's rare most of the time i
*  have an idea and i think i know how it's going to work and then i say it but it doesn't work that
*  good or i have a new way to do it that's better or i come up with a new tagline that changes the bit
*  it's like it's a weird art form because you have to kind of do it in front of people yeah so there's
*  a lot of people that are trying to do it uh like on zoom they're trying to do zoom stand up but
*  it's terrible yeah stand up you have to do live it's like our zoom workout not the same as uh no
*  but it's something it's something it's something getting people moving yeah get people moving yeah
*  yeah to make make america fit again yeah so since you have all these other different things you like
*  to do you think you think you do too many different things what are you thinking about pulling the
*  trigger on what am i adding or taking away what are you adding i love this kid's thing i mean if
*  you if you know that's why i asked you about stand-up comedy versus the podcast or anything
*  you do if you put a gun to my head or a knife like you did earlier when you tested me
*  i um i i like the kids the kids are like wet clay in the sense that um you really feel like
*  you make an impact i feel like i make an impact i've been getting we didn't talk about this i've
*  been getting some 21 or 22 year olds from very very wealthy families that are saying hey joe
*  they know me through somebody whatever um my kids are a little they need some help i want to put them
*  on the farm with you they're hard to fix by the time they're 21 22 they're hard to fix these these
*  little kids um i make a big impact i mean the letters i got are tearjerkers after after the
*  after the text i saw them writing the parents about how terrible i was yeah and then seeing
*  14 days later like the impact yeah i want i want more yeah you know no i think you're
*  dead right about that if you can give a kid a like a transformational experience when they're
*  when they're young something that really sticks with them that's the rest of their life
*  right yep and and uh the other thing i like about it is they can't really quit right you know if the
*  parent gets involved then it's all fucked up but if the parent stays out of it we're doing amazing
*  i'm doing another one right now while i'm sitting here i got another i got another 20 kids there
*  right now and they're there in vermont right now who's running the cracking the whip and the olympian
*  the mountain warfare guy eric ashley and um they're kicking these kids asses and and they're running
*  this every two weeks with new group new group i mean it's selfish for me because i want my i want
*  my kids to keep just re-enlisting right right and so i need more kids for them and so i just hit up
*  another group and some of the old kids came so this is their second tour we'll call it really
*  yeah which is great one of them is an 11 year old girl that's just badass stoic and um and one of
*  the older boys i found out last night when i got to california is hitting his dad up and saying you
*  gotta get me out of here you gotta lie to joe and tell him we have a family vacation get me the
*  fuck out of here and the dad was oldest 15 and and the dad hit me up and and i said listen next time
*  he talks to you tell him we have an 11 year old girl by his side that is finishing this thing are
*  you kidding me so um you can't blame them because they've never tested themselves they've never done
*  hard things right but i love it how are you structuring this do you sit out in advance and
*  decide what they're going to do like every day so andy andy the the olympic wrestler um when he
*  2008 olympian um didn't medal went to russia and he spent a couple years in russia to learn their
*  system why did the russians get all these gold medals in wrestling and they climb mountains and
*  they climb ropes and they just fucking work hard and not that american wrestlers don't um and so we
*  took a bunch of that russian system we took a bunch of the mountain warfare stuff and then we
*  just added the spartan sprinkles in there and the stuff my mom spartan sprinkles spartan sprinkles
*  and so you know they're waking up early they're hiking the mountain uh they're doing miserable
*  shit carrying rocks always purposeful so we're building uh we're building stuff out of the rocks
*  they'll be there for the test of time and so they have they could come back and see the the efforts
*  of their work and cold water is always involved because as you said with the shower cold water
*  sucks um they drink only water as well they drink only water all the Doritos all that stuff is gone
*  it's only three meals a day it's healthy food um probably keeping a little bit hungry um because
*  you know a lion is most handsome when it's hungry um we're not sure yeah i mean it wants food
*  most handsome when they're hungry i mean right it's ready to attack yeah and so um so yeah in
*  bed early um we are issuing phones for 30 minutes they get to text or call their parents or whatever
*  and uh minutes we're doing two days on uh this particular camp is much more wrestling focused
*  so two days on uh and then one day they do a big hike so they did a giant hike today
*  so they do wrestling yeah this this even the first camp i didn't say to you we had a fight club
*  every day so they some of them were wrestlers some weren't there were girls in there never done
*  it before and we created like a brad pit fight club down the basement with andy and uh it was
*  awesome the kids fucking loved that part of the camp every day they loved it so they beat each
*  other up they didn't beat each other it was wrestling so it was smooth he set the rules it
*  was like hey i just want you to get a high single leg this is what it is right so there were games
*  like that okay they loved it they'd pound the mat they'd be screaming for an opponent it was
*  it's almost instinctual or something it was unbelievable that's great that you keep them
*  from their phones for that long too yeah it was it was um yeah it was great so yeah so that's great
*  um if anybody wanted to get a hold of you and wanted to do that how would they uh enlist their
