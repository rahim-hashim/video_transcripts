*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6.0s)]
*  Did I tell somebody I was streaming and you were like, what was I doing? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12.0s)]
*  Yeah, we used to do all the shows live streaming. It was so dangerous. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=17.0s)]
*  Boys, we're back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=21.0s)]
*  Oh, are we on? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=23.0s)]
*  The band is back together. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=24.0s)]
*  Woo! [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=25.0s)]
*  Yay! [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=26.0s)]
*  Hey! [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=27.0s)]
*  Fresh from the club. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=28.0s)]
*  Suck it, Neil deGrasse, you big fat queef. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=29.0s)]
*  Imagine going from that to this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=32.0s)]
*  Imagine going from a legit astrophysicist, head of the Hayden Planetarium, to this podcast. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=34.0s)]
*  He's a sweet guy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=40.0s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=41.0s)]
*  We talked about the James Webb telescope and new capabilities and some pretty wild shit. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=42.0s)]
*  Imagine caring. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=47.0s)]
*  What? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=48.0s)]
*  You don't care at all about space? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=49.0s)]
*  Well, it's a cute photo, it's colorful. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=50.0s)]
*  No, that's just cool. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=52.0s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=53.0s)]
*  It looks like Bejeweled, that video game. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=55.0s)]
*  Imagine if no one was paying attention to space if everyone was like us. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=57.0s)]
*  I'm like, I hope everything up there is good. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=60.0s)]
*  Yeah, whatever that is. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=62.0s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck that shit is. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=63.0s)]
*  Just don't attack. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=65.0s)]
*  As long as there's no attacks, I'm fine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=66.0s)]
*  Even the Native Americans, they would look at it and they would make shit out of it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=68.0s)]
*  The Constellation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=72.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, everybody did. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=74.0s)]
*  The Constellation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=75.0s)]
*  It was pre-TV. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=77.0s)]
*  This is the show. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=78.0s)]
*  The dots are so weirdly connected, too. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=80.0s)]
*  How are you getting an archer? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=82.0s)]
*  How's that an archer? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=84.0s)]
*  You're drawing random lines in. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=85.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're just deciding. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=87.0s)]
*  Oh, Ryan's belt. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=88.0s)]
*  Oh, there's a lion. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=89.0s)]
*  That's not a lion, you fucking idiot. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=90.0s)]
*  It was like shitty porn. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=92.0s)]
*  Remember you watched porn, it was scrambled. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=94.0s)]
*  You saw a tit every now and then. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=95.0s)]
*  You guys were whacking off the Constellations? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=97.0s)]
*  Yeah, holy shit. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=99.0s)]
*  That looks like a tit. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=100.0s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=101.0s)]
*  That's a bit rounded. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=103.0s)]
*  Do you remember when you would stay in these shitty little hotels and they would have like, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=104.0s)]
*  you'd have to pay money through a machine to watch porn? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=112.0s)]
*  There were some hotels that you had to pay. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=113.0s)]
*  Ray Romano has a bit about it because his porn wasn't working, but he goes, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=115.0s)]
*  so you have to call downstairs, but he's like, I have a very recognizable voice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=118.0s)]
*  So he's like, hi, Room 278. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=122.0s)]
*  That was Gilbert who did that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=126.0s)]
*  Yeah, Ray Romano. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=129.0s)]
*  Hey, that's pretty good. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=132.0s)]
*  Not bad. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=133.0s)]
*  He's a sweet man. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=134.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=135.0s)]
*  He's a good dude, man. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=136.0s)]
*  He kind of made his money and just said, I'm just going to fucking fade back a little bit. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=138.0s)]
*  I'm going to fade back a little bit. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=142.0s)]
*  Were you around for the vibrating bed with the quarter? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=144.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=147.0s)]
*  I never saw that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=148.0s)]
*  I thought that was a trope. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=149.0s)]
*  I never saw it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=150.0s)]
*  I got on one of those once just to feel it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=151.0s)]
*  I put the quarter in by myself. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=153.0s)]
*  It was like, boom. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got it as a kid. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=155.0s)]
*  My mom would put them in for us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=156.0s)]
*  It looked good. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=157.0s)]
*  It was so fun. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=158.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=159.0s)]
*  It wasn't good. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=160.0s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=161.0s)]
*  Michael J. Fox hated it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=162.0s)]
*  It balanced them out. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=164.0s)]
*  Some places you would go and they would have the spinning bed of a circular bed, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=165.0s)]
*  and it spun. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=169.0s)]
*  That was like the honeymoon suite. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=170.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=171.0s)]
*  Like in the 1970s. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=172.0s)]
*  There was a house that was for sale that ... Who had it? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=173.0s)]
*  Will Chamberlain? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=179.0s)]
*  Let's stay in one position and look at different walls. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=180.0s)]
*  I think Will Chamberlain had this fuck house that was for sale in the Hollywood Hills, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=182.0s)]
*  and it was just all decked out just for fucking. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=186.0s)]
*  He had a whole room with mirrors and a circular bed. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=190.0s)]
*  Last thing I wanted was a mirror when I'm fucking. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=193.0s)]
*  Holy shit dude. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=196.0s)]
*  I'm going to take you out of it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=197.0s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=198.0s)]
*  You're like, oh my God. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=199.0s)]
*  It looks insane. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=200.0s)]
*  When I'm on top of a woman, it looks fucking insane. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=201.0s)]
*  My back is too curved. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=203.0s)]
*  This is Will Chamberlain's house. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=204.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=205.0s)]
*  Is that a waterbed? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=206.0s)]
*  Yeah, waterbed and mirrors weren't obvious. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=207.0s)]
*  It's wall to wall bed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=208.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=209.0s)]
*  It's all bed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=210.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=211.0s)]
*  It was just banging. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=212.0s)]
*  I bet that's crunchy as shit though. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=213.0s)]
*  Oh, it's just ... If you got one of them black lights and ran it through that room, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=214.0s)]
*  it would look like a Jackson Pollock painting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=215.0s)]
*  That's what I call a Will Chamberlain. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=216.0s)]
*  Fucking jizz everywhere. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=217.0s)]

*  I'm going to go to bed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=244.0s)]
*  Even if he had an average dick for his size, it would be gigantic. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=245.0s)]
*  I heard Shaq is very underwhelming. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=249.0s)]
*  Underwhelming? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=252.0s)]
*  You see how that girl is with Shaq. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=253.0s)]
*  She's always up to his waist. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=254.0s)]
*  That's what I've heard. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=255.0s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=256.0s)]
*  His hands are as big as his table. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=257.0s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=260.0s)]
*  I think he just looks... [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=261.0s)]
*  You know a lady? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=262.0s)]
*  I know a lady. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=263.0s)]
*  That's all Shaq's dick? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=264.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=265.0s)]
*  And she said? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=266.0s)]
*  In college. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=267.0s)]
*  Fine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=268.0s)]
*  I don't know if this should be out there, but... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=269.0s)]
*  At LSU, he's still coming into his own. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=270.0s)]
*  I think, and into her. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=271.0s)]
*  But I think you expect a fucking anaconda, and then when it's just proportionate, you're [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=273.0s)]
*  like, meh. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=279.0s)]
*  But you also have to deal with a girl who, like, I fuck Shaq. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=280.0s)]
*  He ain't shit. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=283.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=284.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=285.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=286.0s)]
*  Lying. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=287.0s)]
*  Bragging. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=288.0s)]
*  They do that to me all the time. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=289.0s)]
*  Every one of them negative review. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=290.0s)]
*  They're just trying to get at me. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=293.0s)]
*  Thank God there's no fuck Yelp. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=295.0s)]
*  That would be bad. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=297.0s)]
*  Felp. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=299.0s)]
*  They had a review for teachers, and I felt like they should always have to put their [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=300.0s)]
*  grades in before their review. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=303.0s)]
*  Rate my professor. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=304.0s)]
*  What did you get? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=305.0s)]
*  Oh, a D? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=306.0s)]
*  And you don't like him? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=307.0s)]
*  Strange. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=308.0s)]
*  We were talking yesterday about how hotels, you get in trouble for smoking, but you can [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=309.0s)]
*  jizz everywhere. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=314.0s)]
*  Isn't that a weird system? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=315.0s)]
*  Well, you don't get secondhand jizz, that's why. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=317.0s)]
*  What are you kidding? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=320.0s)]
*  It's all over the drapes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=321.0s)]
*  It doesn't get in your lungs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=322.0s)]
*  Ah, well. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=324.0s)]
*  Next tenant. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=325.0s)]
*  See them, Sam? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=326.0s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=327.0s)]
*  But what would you rather, a guy blow smoke in your face or jizz in your face? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=328.0s)]
*  Smoke. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=332.0s)]
*  Why do I have to choose? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=333.0s)]
*  Definitely smoke. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=334.0s)]
*  It's a tough choice. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=335.0s)]
*  Can't we get both? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=336.0s)]
*  Aren't we here to party? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=337.0s)]
*  Why are you guys pausing? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=338.0s)]
*  It's definitely smoke. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=339.0s)]
*  The answer is smoke. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=340.0s)]
*  Certainly smoke. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=341.0s)]
*  Which guy, though? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=342.0s)]
*  Ah, John Sally. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=343.0s)]
*  John Stamos? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=344.0s)]
*  I'm taking it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=345.0s)]
*  You take a hot one in the face? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=346.0s)]
*  Stamos is your guy? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=347.0s)]
*  Greek yogurt. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=348.0s)]
*  I'd switch in a second for Stamos. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=349.0s)]
*  You would trade lives with John Stamos? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=350.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=361.0s)]
*  Just to be with him? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=362.0s)]
*  Well, in a lot of prisons you can do that now. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=363.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=366.0s)]

*  pull their money out and they realized there's not enough money. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1561.32s)]
*  The whole thing falls apart. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1564.32s)]
*  This is a very meathead, non-economist version of it. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1565.32s)]
*  And I apologize for being uneducated about this, but that's what happened. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1570.32s)]
*  And so they went from, this guy went from being worth billions of dollars to fucking [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1574.34s)]
*  nothing instantly, like within a week. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1578.34s)]
*  And now some Bitcoin people who lost a shitload of money because billions of dollars are lost. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1581.34s)]
*  Not only that, billions are missing. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1586.34s)]
*  There's billions that they can't account for. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1589.34s)]
*  Check my Coinbase app. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1591.34s)]
*  I used to have some money in here. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1592.34s)]
*  Also, some of it got moved to another company. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1593.34s)]
*  You could just crash everybody's currency like that. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1596.34s)]
*  Well, this is not real currency. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1599.34s)]
*  This is the point of all this. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1600.34s)]
*  This is what I had Yannis on. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1601.36s)]
*  Yannis was like, they're making it out of thin air and then it goes away. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1604.36s)]
*  Of course it fucking went away. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1607.36s)]
*  It's not based on anything. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1608.36s)]
*  But people are using it to buy shit. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1610.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1611.36s)]
*  But the dollar's not based on gold anymore or anything, right? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1612.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1614.36s)]
*  But everybody has to agree. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1615.36s)]
*  And no one's agreeing with this. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1616.36s)]
*  Bitcoin is a stable one. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1618.36s)]
*  What else is stable? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1620.36s)]
*  Ethereum? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1621.36s)]
*  US dollar? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1622.36s)]
*  Yeah, but this is still like, this is more financial than it is crypto. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1623.36s)]
*  It's more Bernie Madoff type Ponzi scheme shit than it is... [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1628.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm absolutely ruined. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1633.3799999999999s)]
*  I lost about 90% of mine. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1634.3799999999999s)]
*  It's like if anybody can have a crypto, you can all make a crypto coin. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1636.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, then we got a whole weird situation. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1642.3799999999999s)]
*  It's not like now we have Bitcoin. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh, let's all use Bitcoins, decentralized. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1646.3799999999999s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1648.3799999999999s)]
*  But then now you have how many coins are there? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1649.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was Bitcoin. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1651.3799999999999s)]
*  Now it's like Tops when Tops is your only trading card in town. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1653.3799999999999s)]
*  And then Don Mercer and Fleer came in and was like, none of this is worth anything. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1655.4s)]
*  Those are way up by the way. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1658.4s)]
*  So if you... [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1660.4s)]
*  Yeah, we want tangible now because everything in NFT and all that horseshit... [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1661.4s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1664.4s)]
*  Let's fucking trading cards are up there. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1665.4s)]
*  They're huge. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1666.4s)]
*  Has the NFT thing died? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1667.4s)]
*  The NFT thing made zero sense to me. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1668.4s)]
*  Made no sense. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1670.4s)]
*  Died in a helicopter. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1671.4s)]
*  It's not a real... [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1672.4s)]
*  Well, you know, makes sense is like that Beeple thing that he made for us. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1673.4s)]
*  But that's not end. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1676.4s)]
*  But that's art. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1677.4s)]
*  That's a piece of art. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1678.4s)]
*  It's actual art. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1679.4s)]
*  It's something there. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1680.4s)]
*  And you own it as an NFT if you got an NFT wallet. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1681.4s)]
*  It's still happening. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1683.4s)]
*  Even during all this crash, big stuff happened. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1684.42s)]
*  Like Nike launched a thing. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1686.42s)]
*  Say that again, Jamie? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1688.42s)]
*  During all this, like Nike's launched a platform to sell some sort of NFT stuff. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1689.42s)]
*  It's still going strong. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1693.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's still happening. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1694.42s)]
*  Why? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1695.42s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1696.42s)]
*  Who's buying them? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1697.42s)]
*  Torx. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1698.42s)]
*  Fucking idiots. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1699.42s)]
*  Twinks. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1700.42s)]
*  They were never really supposed to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1701.42s)]
*  That's kind of the thing that was happening. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1703.42s)]
*  But were they supposed to be worth a good rise? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1704.42s)]
*  It's supposed to be a useful thing. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1706.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1708.42s)]
*  Didn't Ugonzo make like a million dollars? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1709.42s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1712.42s)]
*  They didn't make a bunch of money because there was a hype that people thought they [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1713.44s)]
*  could make like Beanie Baby run. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1715.44s)]
*  They thought they could make money off of this. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1716.44s)]
*  Anyone who was just greedy wanted to make money, but it's not necessarily the use that [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1718.44s)]
*  they were supposed to have. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1721.68s)]
*  Got it. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1722.68s)]
*  So the use they were supposed to have was just to make it so that someone has the intellectual [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1723.68s)]
*  rights to digital property. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1726.72s)]
*  And they could make money off of it if it was sold later. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1727.72s)]
*  That was really about it. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1729.72s)]
*  It is a good way to protect artists. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1730.72s)]
*  And they have this in the UK. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1731.72s)]
*  If you resell a painting, the artist gets paid again. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1733.92s)]
*  You can't sell something for 30 grand, have it sold seven years later for 200 million [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1736.64s)]
*  and they're like, I get nothing? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1739.76s)]
*  That's good. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1741.2s)]
*  I like that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1742.2s)]
*  I think Beanie Babies went through the shitter too. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1743.98s)]
*  I wonder if they changed insurance on paintings. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1744.98s)]
*  I saw the doc on it. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1747.98s)]
*  Trading cards, Beanie Babies, what are you, a fifth grader? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1749.98s)]
*  We're back to our bedbugs. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1752.98s)]
*  Fucking Beanie Babies are tanking. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1755.98s)]
*  You want to find some Pokemon, I gotcha. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1756.98s)]
*  What is that? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1758.98s)]
*  Whoa, mushrooms! [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1759.98s)]
*  Bag of mushrooms? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1760.98s)]
*  JMo. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1761.98s)]
*  What were we just saying? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1762.98s)]
*  Beanie Babies. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1763.98s)]
*  Anti-Semites. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1764.98s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1765.98s)]
*  Ares. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1766.98s)]
*  A Diva. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1767.98s)]
*  Shit. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1768.98s)]
*  I used to love Beanie Babies. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1769.98s)]
*  I was a gay kid. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1771.76s)]
*  Protecting artists? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1772.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1773.76s)]
*  It was one of the last things I liked that was gay. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1774.76s)]
*  That is gay. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1780.76s)]
*  I was old for liking Beanie Babies. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1781.76s)]
*  That is weird. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1783.76s)]
*  I never got them. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1784.76s)]
*  I could never buy them. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1785.76s)]
*  I never got them. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1786.76s)]
*  My friends had a bunch of them. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1787.76s)]
*  How old were you? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1788.76s)]
*  25th, 6th grade? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1789.76s)]
*  6th grade? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1790.76s)]
*  That's way too old. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1791.76s)]
*  I never had them. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1792.76s)]
*  I would go to my friend's house and get cool Beanie Babies. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1793.76s)]
*  Makes sense though. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1796.76s)]
*  Who's his friend? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1797.76s)]
*  Milo? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1798.76s)]
*  What? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1799.76s)]
*  Who are your friends with? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1801.54s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1802.54s)]
*  Mark? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1803.54s)]
*  It's a weird thing to keep as a 17 year old. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1804.54s)]
*  He was a 5th grader. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=1806.54s)]

*  23andMe has verified I have no Neanderthal ancestry in my genetic code. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=2294.9s)]

*  and convert it into comedy, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4227.5199999999995s)]
*  and then he's hanging out with all these rock stars, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4228.88s)]
*  and because he did these late night sets at the store, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4230.76s)]
*  that's how he became infamous. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4232.86s)]
*  People would come see him, and they would be like, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4235.0s)]
*  where's that guy? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4237.08s)]
*  What time is he going up? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4237.92s)]
*  And it was like a word of mouth thing. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4239.16s)]
*  They would go to see the Kinnison set. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4240.8s)]
*  To this day, they call it the Kinnison set, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4242.36s)]
*  the late night spot. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4243.88s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4244.72s)]
*  He'd come in at 12, 30, no one cared. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4245.5599999999995s)]
*  Drunk with his friends with six or seven top level stars. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4247.0199999999995s)]
*  You saw him? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4249.76s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4250.599999999999s)]
*  I got there years after he died. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4251.5s)]
*  When did he die? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4253.66s)]
*  He died in, I wanna say like 92. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4254.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4258.299999999999s)]
*  Somewhere around then. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4259.259999999999s)]
*  Wasn't it around then? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4260.099999999999s)]
*  But they said he'd bring people from the rainbow room, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4260.94s)]
*  they'd all party, so no one cared, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4261.82s)]
*  because you're not really bumping anybody. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4262.86s)]
*  It's 12, 30, there's just pop-ins anyway. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4264.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4266.5s)]
*  And he'd make it suddenly get packed. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4267.339999999999s)]
*  He died in 92. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4268.379999999999s)]
*  He died, I remember when he died, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4269.7s)]
*  because I was in New York, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4271.62s)]
*  and I was in my apartment, and it was on MTV News. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4274.259999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4277.419999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh my God. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4278.259999999999s)]
*  I remember not hearing about it, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4279.419999999999s)]
*  and I was like, I was in New York, and I was there. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4280.8s)]
*  I was in New York, and I was there. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4281.62s)]
*  So you gotta realize, it wasn't even a 10-year run. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4282.46s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4284.68s)]
*  So from 86 to 92 is when he was big, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4285.52s)]
*  and he had already... [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4287.9s)]
*  He was already topped off. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4288.74s)]
*  Not just topped off, but heavily declined. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4289.96s)]
*  If you listen to his first special, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4293.28s)]
*  and then, well, he's got like the album. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4295.8s)]
*  The album's good, Louder Than Hell's good, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4298.48s)]
*  you can only get it on cassette now. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4300.22s)]
*  I got that one on vinyl. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4301.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4302.98s)]
*  That's a good find, that's a good find. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4303.82s)]
*  And then there was the special, the HBO special, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4304.78s)]
*  what was that called? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4307.96s)]
*  Young Comedians special. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4308.8s)]
*  Oh, maybe that one was Louder Than Hell. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4310.32s)]
*  No, no, no, Louder Than Hell's definitely the cassette. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4311.88s)]
*  Was the album, okay. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4313.48s)]
*  And then there was the HBO special. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4314.32s)]
*  And then, it was like a year and a half or so later, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4316.0s)]
*  he put out a new special, and it was not good. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4318.92s)]
*  It was rough, was that the Girls on Chains he brought in? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4321.16s)]
*  It was like, he bought into who he was. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4323.759999999999s)]
*  Exactly, he got audience capture. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4325.5599999999995s)]
*  So Louder Than Hell was 86, Breaking the Rules was 87, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4328.599999999999s)]
*  and that one was not good. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4331.8s)]
*  Have You Seen Me Lately, 88, also not good. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4333.04s)]
*  The rest of them are not good. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4335.719999999999s)]
*  Isn't that sad, huh? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4337.24s)]
*  It's sad. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4338.599999999999s)]
*  He was just partying. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4340.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta work at it. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4340.98s)]
*  You ever read Brother Bill? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4342.82s)]
*  Bill Kinnison wrote it, his brother Bill, it's really good. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4345.0199999999995s)]
*  Brother Sam it's called, the book's called Brother Sam. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4348.46s)]
*  But his brother wrote this book about what happened, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4350.58s)]
*  and he's real honest about it. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4353.5s)]
*  He's like, he stopped writing. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4354.62s)]
*  He used to write constantly, he always had new material, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4357.179999999999s)]
*  but then he was partying and doing coke, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4359.44s)]
*  and hanging out with John Bon Jovi, making music videos. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4361.379999999999s)]
*  He was the talk of the town. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4364.179999999999s)]
*  He forgot the work that goes into it. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4365.94s)]
*  That's every star, they just forget the work [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4367.139999999999s)]
*  that goes into it. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4368.5s)]
*  He was passing even 10 years, man. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4370.24s)]
*  It was right away. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4371.08s)]
*  That's what's crazy, 86 to 92, that's his heyday. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4371.900000000001s)]
*  There were 38 and a half comics back then. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4374.72s)]
*  Now you're right. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4376.56s)]
*  There wasn't many. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4377.4400000000005s)]
*  Damn, didn't he get hit by a drunk driver? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4378.64s)]
*  Yep, after he did jokes about drunk driving. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4380.72s)]
*  We're gonna drink, we're gonna drive, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4383.28s)]
*  we're gonna pull it off, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4384.8s)]
*  cause we do it every fucking day. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4385.96s)]
*  That was not in the show. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4387.68s)]
*  He was coming the other way. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4389.72s)]
*  God, you ever think about the amount of times [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4390.8s)]
*  you drank and drove and just made it? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4392.96s)]
*  I came back from a Stanhope show at King King [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4396.08s)]
*  and I was somewhere in Hollywood, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4398.1s)]
*  running back to the comic store for last call, drunk, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4398.84s)]
*  hit someone in front of the saddle ranch. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4401.98s)]
*  And I was like, I was exchanging insurance [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4404.3s)]
*  of trying to keep it together. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4405.9s)]
*  A cop slowed down and I was like, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=4406.74s)]

*  but it's also like, that guy's a legit fighter. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5937.74s)]
*  He's not just a YouTube guy. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5940.02s)]
*  He moves like a fighter. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5942.5199999999995s)]
*  You watch him in fights, he's not boxing like some guy. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5943.36s)]
*  Why don't we fight like a current young fighter? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5946.24s)]
*  Oh, Tyron Woodley. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5948.32s)]
*  No, but someone like 30. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5951.16s)]
*  What is this? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5953.72s)]
*  Jake Paul offered Patty the Batty $1 million to spar, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5954.68s)]
*  and Pimblitt didn't back down. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5958.08s)]
*  But he's way bigger than him. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5960.08s)]
*  This weekend, and he'll spar him on Monday. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5961.2s)]
*  Pimblitt's like 5'4 or something. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5964.28s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5965.92s)]
*  He gets up to like 200 pounds. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5967.24s)]
*  What? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5968.84s)]
*  Between fights. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5969.68s)]
*  Balloons, he balloons. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5970.52s)]
*  He's a really good grappler. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5971.780000000001s)]
*  The difference between the two of them is like boxing. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5973.580000000001s)]
*  Patty is, you know, he's got good hands for sure. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5976.860000000001s)]
*  He's a good striker. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5979.620000000001s)]
*  Cute kid. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5980.860000000001s)]
*  Beautiful, beautiful kid. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5981.9400000000005s)]
*  But if he gets you to the ground, he's nasty. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5983.1s)]
*  Imagine, wow, really bad ass submission. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5985.740000000001s)]
*  So if they're gonna fight, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5988.38s)]
*  if they're not gonna fight an MMA fight. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5989.540000000001s)]
*  To spar though. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5991.34s)]
*  Yeah, but they're gonna fight, dude. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5993.06s)]
*  Fight, fight. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5995.34s)]
*  They're gonna call it sparring. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5996.18s)]
*  If you're calling it sparring, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5997.580000000001s)]
*  and you're gonna film it, and everyone's gonna watch it, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=5999.320000000001s)]
*  and you're gonna do one round. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6001.96s)]
*  Come on, you wanna spar me? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6003.02s)]
*  They're training for it. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6003.860000000001s)]
*  I'll give you a million dollars to spar me. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6004.7s)]
*  Yeah, both those guys are psychos. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6006.0s)]
*  They're not gonna. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6007.16s)]
*  What you're doing is you're having an unsanctioned fight. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6008.0s)]
*  Right, that's your way around it. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6009.88s)]
*  This guy's paying you a million dollars [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6010.72s)]
*  to have an unsanctioned fight. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6012.08s)]
*  Damn. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6013.84s)]
*  I mean, you can call it sparring. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6014.68s)]
*  Would you fight him? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6016.08s)]
*  Let's call it sparring. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6016.92s)]
*  No. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6017.76s)]
*  You wouldn't fight Jake? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6018.58s)]
*  No. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6019.42s)]
*  You can kick him. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6020.24s)]
*  One round. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6021.08s)]
*  No, you can't fuck me up. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6021.900000000001s)]
*  He's good. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6022.74s)]
*  He's a good boxer. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6023.58s)]
*  He can fight, man. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6024.42s)]
*  I've seen him. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6025.400000000001s)]
*  He's a big, dangerous, young fellow, and he hits hard. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6026.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6029.4400000000005s)]
*  He's knocked out. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6030.280000000001s)]
*  Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley, knocked down Jake Paul, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6031.12s)]
*  I mean, knocked down Anderson Silver, rather. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6033.12s)]
*  That's a big deal, man. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6035.400000000001s)]
*  That guy can crack. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6036.56s)]
*  What's with the legs breaking? [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6037.68s)]
*  Didn't O'Malley's leg break? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6038.72s)]
*  No, he got kicked in the leg, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6040.54s)]
*  in the, what's it called, perineal nerve, that was called? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6043.320000000001s)]
*  And that nerve shut off his foot. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6046.6s)]
*  His foot just stopped working, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6048.92s)]
*  and he started getting this, it's called drop foot, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6050.72s)]
*  and he actually did commentary for the video [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6053.06s)]
*  while it was happening. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6056.3s)]
*  And that was the last one. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6057.44s)]
*  You can't help yourself. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6059.42s)]
*  That was it. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6061.06s)]
*  That was the last one. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6061.9s)]
*  Let me write that one down. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6063.22s)]
*  I'm trying so hard to keep it together. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6064.06s)]
*  I can't do it. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6066.14s)]
*  That's why it doesn't work on the leads, too. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6066.98s)]
*  Ben, you're on speed dates? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6069.46s)]
*  So Sean O'Malley, he did like a play-by-play [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6070.86s)]
*  with that fight, and you could see his foot go numb. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6073.62s)]
*  It's just like he's just dragging his foot around, [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6076.0199999999995s)]
*  and he can't stand on it. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6078.14s)]
*  And he had these tight ankle wraps on, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6079.54s)]
*  and you think that might have accentuated it, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6082.120000000001s)]
*  not allowed the circulation to get back to normal. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6084.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's embarrassing. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6088.08s)]
*  It is hard. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6090.280000000001s)]
*  Weird injury. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6091.360000000001s)]
*  Well, you just flop it around on the mat. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6092.4400000000005s)]
*  It looks bad. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6094.52s)]
*  It's happened to a few guys. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6095.360000000001s)]
*  It happened to Michael Chandler in Bellator. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6096.4400000000005s)]
*  He got that. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6098.8s)]
*  That happened to him. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6099.64s)]
*  It's happened to a couple of guys in the UFC. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6100.46s)]
*  They get kicked in the leg, [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6102.58s)]
*  and their leg just doesn't work right anymore. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6103.56s)]
*  What about that guy? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6104.96s)]
*  He just stops working. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6105.8s)]
*  He kicked and his leg wrapped around the guy's shin? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6106.620000000001s)]
*  Anderson. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6108.52s)]
*  Well, a couple, yes, Anderson was one of them. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6109.360000000001s)]
*  He did that with Chris Weidman. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6112.14s)]
*  And then Chris Weidman was another one. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6114.02s)]
*  Chris Weidman just did it recently. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6116.26s)]
*  Not recently, like over. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6117.9800000000005s)]
*  He hasn't come back from it. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6119.22s)]
*  It's been over, I believe over a year. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6120.46s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6122.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it just slaps against a leg and just like. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6123.660000000001s)]
*  Breaks. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6125.9800000000005s)]
*  I've seen it happen in kickboxing too. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6126.820000000001s)]
*  It happened with Tyrone Spong fought Gokan Saki, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6129.42s)]
*  and Saki checked his kick and snapped his leg in half. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6132.740000000001s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6135.780000000001s)]
*  There it is. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6136.62s)]
*  First kick that Chris threw. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6137.4400000000005s)]

*  Wow, that is an antelope leg. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6148.759999999999s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6150.599999999999s)]
*  Who's doing this? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6152.44s)]

*  Jamie, cut it out. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6156.28s)]
*  You don't even blink. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6157.12s)]
*  It's already broken there. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=6159.5199999999995s)]

*  Well, that's why it works so well. [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12355.04s)]
*  But I think back then, there wasn't enough information [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12357.04s)]
*  about where the art form was going. [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12359.84s)]
*  And so, people were just trying stuff [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12362.68s)]
*  and it hadn't been done before. [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12364.92s)]
*  You gotta be like, Kinnison branches out, [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12366.2s)]

*  He's in that outlaws of comedy. [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12372.720000000001s)]
*  So Kinnison and Hicks hung out together. [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12374.300000000001s)]
*  That's why they have similar facial features. [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12376.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12378.560000000001s)]

*  when I first saw Kinnison and then I saw Hicks, [[03:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12382.060000000001s)]
*  I saw Hicks at the Comedy Connection. [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12385.32s)]
*  And I was like, wow, a lot of the sounds he makes [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUyUSp6S9N8&t=12387.02s)]
