# Joe Rogan Experience #2130 - Coleman Hughes
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNYtG8iZ71E)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  What's up, Coleman? Good to see you. Good to see you again. What's cracking?
*  Well, I'm good, you know. You're great. You got a new book. Got a new book.
*  End of Race Politics, Arguments for Colorblind America.
*  Yeah, I saw you on The View. Yeah. Yeah, so that's been
*  overwhelming my past couple days. Yeah, is that annoying?
*  No. No? No, no. I mean, it's just, when I was on there
*  I really had no idea how it was going to land with the audience. So I just
*  went in there, did my thing. I had no idea what to expect. I didn't know
*  who Sunny Hostin was. I actually still really don't know. So I wasn't expecting
*  necessarily for her to kind of try to ambush me in that way and
*  attack my character in that way. And I
*  responded to it in the moment as I do. And I didn't expect it to go as viral
*  as it did, but I think it arguably went
*  more viral than anything I've ever done. It's hard for me to totally
*  tell, but I just got people messaging me almost nonstop for
*  like four days afterwards. Well, it is the show that people love to hate. Yes,
*  that's true. They get so much hate watching and hate
*  hate watching viral clips of them saying ridiculous things.
*  I mean, it is a rabies-infested
*  henhouse. And at the same time, it seemed like the most interesting
*  part was their audience seemed to be on my side. Yes. And that's their audience.
*  Yes. Well, their audience is not really their audience. Their audience is a group
*  of people they bring in to watch television shows. You know,
*  I don't know if you've ever seen audiences before for TV shows, but
*  a lot of them are paid. They're paid to be there. So, because they have
*  to guarantee that there's going to be people there. So, there's services that you hire. And when
*  a show gets really, really popular, you know, like Letterman or something like
*  that, obviously it has its own fan base. Right. Those people
*  will try to get tickets before anybody else does. And in that case, they probably
*  don't need to use a service anymore. They just get actual fans.
*  But arguably, like the fans,
*  the real fans of The View that are like, oh, these ladies are on point.
*  Most of those people can't leave the house. Like, they're probably immobile. Right.
*  Right. Right. Because their mom's taking their kids to school and that's, yeah.
*  It's a very strange show, but it's fun to watch.
*  It's just fun to watch them. It's good entertainment. Yeah. Undoubtedly.
*  Well, they're just, you know, it's interesting because I think Sunny is very intelligent, but she's
*  ideologically captured. Right. You know, that's sort of, I think the other
*  ones, there's a couple of the other ones I don't have to name any names, who are just
*  very dull minded. But I think Sunny's not one of them. I think she's smart,
*  but captured. Sure. I think she came into it with an agenda.
*  Of course. They do everything with an agenda. Yeah. You know. She came into
*  it, it seems, really wanting to paint
*  me as someone that has been co-opted by the right wing. Yeah. And I don't know how much
*  research she had done into me. She claimed to have read my book twice, which
*  is almost certainly not true. Yeah.
*  I think she was totally miss summarizing. When did the book come out? February.
*  The odds are very low. Very low, right? Yeah. Very low.
*  Think of how many guests they have on their show, how much time she has. How many things they have to do, family obligations,
*  what is it, about 250 pages? Something like that, yeah.
*  I don't think so. Yeah. But I mean, I might be wrong. I mean, do you
*  have an audiobook available? I do, yeah. I read it myself. Maybe she did it at
*  double speed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Twice. So I sounded like Ben Shapiro the whole time.
*  Have you ever listened to Ben Shapiro on like
*  1.5 times? No, it's kind of ridiculous. Yeah, it's insane. Ben Shapiro
*  should debate Destiny. Oh my god. No, they did. They did debate.
*  Did they really? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. They did. About what? Who hosted them?
*  Was it Lex? Was it? I could be getting that wrong,
*  but I think Lex hosted a debate like two months ago. Well, he had a debate a couple
*  of months ago, but it was a Palestine- No, no, that was separate. I also saw
*  that. Oh. That was like the four hours. They did. Yeah, there you go. That guy debates
*  everybody. Yeah. It's so ridiculous. He does a Wikipedia
*  search and then just starts going after things like he's an expert. Yeah.
*  It's just, it's a fun time. It's a really fun time.
*  Yeah. It's entertaining. Fun time for watching people flail. Yeah.
*  For sure. Yeah, but I think the problem with that show
*  is that show has this very specific ideological
*  bubble in which they operate in. And they always bring on a token conservative
*  woman and they yell over her and silence her. They did that with Megan McCain
*  and they did that with the, who was that other blonde woman from
*  Survivor? Do you remember her, Jamie? She was always yelling. I mean, it's just
*  a, it's a bizarre show. So we had eight
*  minutes and America's
*  approach to race, pretty big topic, pretty important topic.
*  I think the way you, before you start, I think the way you described it is
*  brilliant and the way we should all look at it. Of course you're
*  going to see race. The idea of being colorblind is ridiculous, but treat everybody.
*  They're just human beings. Everybody's just individuals. That's right. That's
*  what we should all hope for. That's right. Yeah, there's been this common phrase
*  I don't see race that's equated with colorblindness. And
*  the point in my book is I want to say get rid of that. Of course we see race, certainly in America,
*  in the West. You could argue about whether children really see race, but past a
*  certain point we see race. Point is not to pretend you don't see it. It's
*  to say, you know, you're a white guy. I'm a black and Hispanic
*  guy. We notice that. We're not going to pretend it's not there, but
*  whenever it matters, I'm going to try to treat you like an individual
*  based on your personal qualities and we're going to ask the government to do the same.
*  Get race out of public policy. If you want to help disadvantaged people,
*  do that on the basis of class. 100%. And understand that
*  when you see these incentives that are put into corporations,
*  these are methods of control. And
*  that's what's going on when you see things like DEI initiatives. You're
*  not really making the world a better place. You're just allowing
*  these financial institutions to enact control over corporations.
*  And it's a really shifty, weird way they're doing it
*  by making it seem like they're trying to make the world a better, more equal place.
*  And then there's some people who are good intentioned, but
*  have a very narrow perspective and a very limited amount of information
*  that they're operating under that will try to
*  pretend that these things are overall good, are net positive.
*  Right. And Sonny Hauston may be one of those people,
*  but, you know, so we had eight minutes to deal with this topic on one of the biggest platforms
*  in the country, and especially an audience that isn't my typical
*  audience. If anything, the View's audience is really who needs to hear my message the most.
*  And Sonny decided to take up a few
*  minutes of that precious eight minutes and attack me as
*  someone who's been co-opted by the right and someone who's a charlatan.
*  And... Did she use the term charlatan? She did. It's funny, because I
*  actually didn't notice it in real time. I kind of went in one ear and out the other.
*  But... How did she say it? She said something like
*  a lot of people in the black community,
*  implicitly herself included, think that you've been co-opted by the right
*  and that you're a charlatan. Oh, wow. Yeah. And I explained to her
*  I've only voted twice, both for Democrats, Hillary and Biden,
*  very open to voting for Republicans. So I'm a
*  political independent, and I'm only young enough to have voted twice.
*  I'm an analyst at CNN, and I write for the Free Press, which is Barry Weiss's.
*  And I'm independent in all of those endeavors. And I patiently
*  explain that and then basically ask her to go back to the topic that
*  we're here to discuss. Yeah. Well, it's a dumb way of
*  addressing a thing and to immediately say that someone's been co-opted with no
*  evidence whatsoever. There's nothing about anything that you say
*  that seems right-wing. You know, you're just objectively
*  looking at these subjects and giving a very
*  intelligent and measured opinion of them. That's not
*  just because some people who happen to vote Republican
*  may agree with you. Yeah. That's a ridiculous statement that you're
*  co-opted. I think you're probably one of the least co-opted people I've ever talked
*  to. You're very open-minded. You're very objective.
*  I try to be. I try to be. But
*  I would argue, even if I were co-opted
*  hypothetically, that doesn't make my argument here right
*  now wrong. Right. Because people that are co-opted sometimes say
*  true things. Yes. So even if I were, I would say it's still
*  an ad hominem attack. It's to the person rather than to the argument. Yes. So let's
*  get on to the issue. And I think people, part of the reason it went
*  viral is because what people have told me is you very
*  rarely see someone who gets a character attack on a big TV platform
*  calmly expose it as evidence free and then just move back to the
*  topic. Yeah. Well, that was beautiful that you did that. And that's how everybody should
*  approach these things. And the problem is that's not what people want to do. What they want
*  to do is engage in argument and try to win. And it's not
*  really about having an open mind and listening to what this person
*  has to say and trying to figure out whether or not it resonates with you. Instead, they're
*  just trying to win and trying to win in this weird sound bitey
*  way. You know, those platforms,
*  whether it's the View or any number of these panel platforms,
*  are so inherently flawed just in the
*  way it's formatted. You only have a small amount of time.
*  You have all these people talking. And you know, it's just
*  a, they can't compete
*  with internet shows because internet shows are
*  free. Yeah. It's just, I don't mean free like you don't have to pay for it.
*  I mean free. Like they're free to talk about anything. There's not a producer in your ear.
*  There's not someone saying we have to cut to commercial. There's not
*  executive meetings before talking about an
*  agenda that you would like to, like this, we have to hammer him on this. And this is
*  really important with the election coming up and this and that. God,
*  the whole election coming up thing freaks me out because I think everybody
*  is in this weird like pre-battle anxiety
*  stage, you know, and everything is
*  life or death and this goddamn phrase that gets tossed around
*  every five minutes. It's just a threat to democracy.
*  Everything is a threat to democracy. Except things that
*  actually probably are a threat to democracy. You see people talking about the threats
*  to democracy and they ignore intelligence
*  communities censoring social media, which should be
*  terrifying to people. Right. It should be terrifying to people because this could happen
*  on the left, on the right, it could happen for a number of
*  reasons, it could happen for reasons that would be terrible for your
*  life. Yeah. RFK was on CNN I think yesterday.
*  And he said something that I think I've said before privately
*  and I feel which is that I think America would survive former years of Trump
*  or former years of Biden. Yes. I think America and the Republic
*  is strong enough to survive either. Neither one of them
*  is a very good option in my view. I think we're given two very bad options
*  but I also think don't move to Canada. I think we're going to be okay.
*  Don't move to Canada. Canada is even worse. Canada is a mess.
*  But people don't like that opinion because they, I think
*  they enjoy, we enjoy the existential stakes
*  of politics even if it might not be there every time. Yeah, I agree.
*  Now I disagreed back in 2015, 2016 when I was hearing
*  how Trump was speaking on, you know
*  Muslims on the registry, all this kind of stuff. I was one of the people
*  that was worried he would be a fascist. Truthfully.
*  But then what happened is we had four years of governance from him where he basically
*  governed like a typical Republican and in some ways even
*  had some policies that were to the left of what Republicans would do. For instance
*  on criminal justice reform he was very progressive. He made
*  funding for black colleges and universities permanent which
*  if Obama had done either of those things he would have been criticized as playing
*  left wing identity politics. Right. And so
*  I slowly realized that there is a pretty big distance between
*  what Trump says and what he does. I don't understand that fact
*  about him but I think it is a fact about him. And so
*  that's why I don't feel alarmist the way I did when I voted
*  for Hillary in 2016. Really voted against Trump.
*  Now that being said, Trump is a wild guy and is difficult to
*  predict. I don't think he's someone you want behind the wheel in a
*  crisis time. And then on the other hand we have Biden who
*  has clear evidence of cognitive decline
*  vying for what's supposed to be the most important and challenging
*  job in the world, certainly in the country, and
*  people essentially claiming that it doesn't matter that he has obvious
*  cognitive decline. Which is hilarious. Not only that but gaslighting
*  you. Saying that that's his superpower. Did you see that article? No I didn't.
*  Biden's age is his superpower. Seth MacFarlane retweeted it. I agree.
*  I couldn't have stated this any better myself. What are you talking about?
*  One way I've thought about it is
*  there's so much BS in politics. One of the great things about the market is that
*  it's honest. Because if you lie you lose money. So if you look at
*  when lots of money is on the line who do people want leading their organizations?
*  Look at the NBA, look at the MLB. Who do people get as head coaches?
*  Usually people in their 50s is the median age. Because you've been around
*  long enough that you've made a lot of dumb mistakes that 20 year olds and 30 year olds
*  make. And you've learned those things that you can only learn with age.
*  But in your 50s you're still
*  got the vast majority of your cognitive power there. And your energy.
*  If you're healthy that is. So that's really the sweet spot. We want a president
*  somewhere in our 50s. We don't want a Biden.
*  No we want someone with life experience and hopefully someone that doesn't exist
*  solely in politics. Someone who hasn't become
*  their roots haven't been deeply entrenched in the system.
*  Someone who can maybe have some sort of an outsider's perspective
*  that can look at the problems with the current situation and the way
*  things are structured. The way money is allocated and the way funding is done.
*  The way bills are passed. Which is a giant issue. Like when they
*  sandwich these 2000 page bills with a bunch of stuff
*  that has nothing to do with it. It should be illegal. It shouldn't be legal
*  to have a bill about, let's say, a popular topic
*  the border issue, the border crisis. And embed
*  in that funding for Ukraine. Like what? It doesn't make any sense
*  to couple those issues. Yeah I mean a few months ago. So basically you've had
*  the Biden administration ignoring the border issue for several years
*  because they wanted to signal sort of how non-Trump
*  they were. And the border is Trump's issue so Biden comes in and he says
*  we're going to undo everything Trump did with the border even though a lot
*  of those policies are actually widely supported and
*  smart. So they undo everything. The migrant crisis goes
*  to hell in the past two or three years. Even now infiltrating
*  cities like Chicago and New York everywhere.
*  And then you have Biden finally gets serious about the border
*  a couple months ago with the border bill. And Trump
*  gives the signal essentially that it's not a good bill even though it really
*  it was a pretty decent bill and certainly in an emergency
*  you want to stop the bleeding. Then Trump signals
*  that the bill isn't good enough and Republicans kill it essentially.
*  So I think both sides have tried to spin this.
*  The Democrat spin has been, look the Republicans
*  can destroy that bill. They don't even care about immigration. The whole
*  thing's their fault. Of course what's wrong with that is the reason it's this bad
*  is because Democrats have been ignoring the issue fully
*  for two, three years. Why do you think that is?
*  Does anybody have anything to gain by letting migrants into the country?
*  Tim Dillon says that he thinks that it's cheap labor
*  and that they want to bring more cheap labor into the country and
*  that it's very difficult to get people to do certain jobs. That's why libertarians
*  partly like illegal immigration. That would be more of a Koch brothers
*  policy though. I mean that's why Bernie Sanders
*  called open borders or Koch brothers policies because cheap labor.
*  Interesting. But that wouldn't apply necessarily to
*  Biden. Okay so someone like Biden, I understand
*  you might argue, okay are they letting people in because those are going to be the Democrat
*  voters, those are going to increase the Democrat voters base.
*  I don't know, does Biden care about that? I don't think so. Biden's not going to be around in ten
*  years. Well I don't think Biden's making decisions. You don't think he is?
*  No. You think it's his circle at this point? Yeah I think he's so far gone.
*  This is what I said when he was running. I was saying
*  you're going to leave it up to his cabinet. He's not able
*  to form. Listen, when you see him at debates or
*  at press conferences, he's at his very best. And he's probably
*  medicated. They probably juice him up with a bunch of different things and get
*  him hyped. Let's go! Roll him out there. And then
*  even then he can't form sentences. He loses
*  track of what he's talking about. That's him
*  at his very best. What is he like when he's tired? What is he like when he's
*  not primed? I do not think that he even
*  has the interest in doing that. I think he wanted
*  to be president. He got to be president. He has all these people around him.
*  Even by the way he talks about things, he's so out of touch
*  with the way he's describing things and talking about bills
*  that they pass and talking about important issues. I just think he's completely out
*  of it. And I think it's really, it's
*  very unfair. And if that was my father, I would be terrified.
*  I'd be sad. I'd be like, what are you doing him? He should
*  be relaxing somewhere. He's embarrassing himself.
*  It's not fair. Take a person that's in cognitive
*  decline like that and just parade him
*  out there and use him as a figurehead. It's just crazy. And if you look at the difference
*  between him now and him in 2020, he didn't look great in 2020,
*  but he looked like he could handle himself. It's a huge difference
*  now. And just extrapolate that three more years.
*  How is he going to be dealing with Putin and Iran and Israel
*  in three years? He's not. He's not doing it now.
*  Someone else forming the policies. They have the White House press secretary
*  got busted for using his Twitter account. You saw that? Oh no, I didn't see that.
*  She accidentally used her account
*  and she tweeted, when I was running for president, I deleted it,
*  but everybody caught it obviously. And obviously there's the
*  Kamala liability. Yeah, that's a hilarious one.
*  The Kamala fans are my favorite. Who are they? Yeah, I got a guy.
*  I got a guy. I don't want to say his name. I'm trying to be respectful, but he's
*  a comedian that's out of his fucking mind. He's one of them blue no matter who.
*  He's operated a
*  he's got this cognitive dissonance that's very bizarre.
*  My dad was in an econ club with Kamala
*  in college. Really? Yeah, there's a photo of them. There's only eight kids in the club.
*  So it's this tiny photo of my dad and Kamala Harris and six
*  other people when they were like 22 or something at Howard University.
*  What's his perspective? He doesn't remember her at all. Interesting.
*  Unless she's the vice president of the United States. Yeah, she didn't make an impression.
*  One heart beat away with a dying man at the helm.
*  Yeah, I mean she could sneak up behind him at any moment and end it.
*  At any moment. At any moment.
*  It's crazy. And it's so American.
*  It really is. We're just like a goofy ass country.
*  We're amazing and it's pretty cool, but it's also
*  we crawl so far up the ass at anybody
*  that wants to be in a position of leadership that no one
*  who should be in a position of leadership wants that. And most of these
*  people that could be effective in a position of leadership because they've led
*  things before, whether it's businesses or what have you, they just don't want to
*  have anything to do with it. It's just a horrible attack on your character. They don't play
*  fair. They lie. They'll get people to say things that aren't
*  true. They'll concoct stories. They'll put things out there
*  with the aid of the intelligence community like the Russia collusion agenda.
*  Like that thing. And then they get all the media that's on the left
*  on board and then they just repeat this mantra over and over.
*  Russia collusion. Russia collusion. You know. And then
*  they'll pretend that they didn't say that he never won the election. They'll pretend.
*  They pretend that they didn't question the election. They'll pretend that Hillary
*  Clinton didn't do multiple speeches where she said that
*  the election was stolen. He's not a legitimate president. Russia stole
*  the election with no evidence. But when he questions the election, it's a
*  threat to democracy. It's just so convenient. And there's just
*  we live in this bizarre news cycle where there's information is coming
*  at you so fast you kind of forget about what the thing you were mad about two days ago
*  that could affect the rest of the country for decades. And you're just on
*  to the next. On to the next. I think in particular in America we
*  were very hard on our politicians. And that's actually the idea
*  of the country from the start is there's no kings here. Right. Right. And you go to other
*  places in the world. People worship or pretend to worship their politicians.
*  You can sort of see why someone would want to be in that position. When you see the crowds
*  of people fainting over Hitler speeches and all that stuff.
*  Well you can see why someone would want to have crowds fainting over them.
*  In America you get some admiration but you kind of just looks like
*  you get your life ruined. Well at least half the country is going to hate you. Yeah.
*  Even a president that's popular like Obama during his
*  administration at least half of the country hated him. Totally.
*  And that's a horrible place to be. It's a horrible feeling to be that person
*  and know that there's all these people that think you're a Muslim
*  plant. You were born in Kenya. Or you wear a tan suit and now
*  it's on the news cycle how much of an idiot you are from wearing a tan suit. A tan suit. I mean
*  it's a nice suit. What is wrong with the color tan?
*  Why does a suit have to be dark blue or black or whatever it is that everybody
*  thinks it has to be. That's so bizarre. Because he could wear
*  a tan shirt somewhere and give a speech like if he's you know at
*  his home or something like that and he just addresses the press in a casual manner. That's fine.
*  Right. But when you're being serious I want you to put on your serious
*  outfit. Your serious outfit can't be tan. Right.
*  People ask me all the time why I don't get into politics or people expect me to get
*  into politics because. Please don't. They see me on The View. Well thank you. You get it.
*  You get it. They see me on something like The View and they say wow
*  I like this guy. He keeps his cool under pressure. He stands for what I believe
*  him. Why don't you run for office man? I'm like are you crazy?
*  Are you absolutely insane? Why would I do that to myself
*  for such a...
*  I even doubt how much change you could even have frankly
*  which is why I...as much as I admire
*  someone like RFK for his charisma in the sense that he's the only candidate
*  that if he talks for five minutes off the cuff I find it really compelling.
*  I think he's very honest. I think he's honest whether you agree with him or disagree
*  with him I think he's very honest and he's also very well read in
*  everything that he talks about. Yeah. And there's a lot of things
*  that are very uncomfortable to discuss that he discusses openly and willingly.
*  And when you look at that man's background
*  and this is a thing that people choose to ignore when they want to talk about him as a
*  conspiracy theorist. This is the big one. They always bring up conspiracy theorists.
*  That guy stopped the polluting of the Hudson River.
*  I mean he was a very effective environmental attorney that was dedicated
*  to making sure that corporations couldn't just
*  wantonly pollute things because it was more profitable for them
*  to not pay attention to where their waste goes. He held them
*  to task and he's one of the primary reasons why the Hudson River is clean.
*  That guy. I've heard that. I never looked into it but if true
*  it's very impressive. But beyond that just in terms of charisma
*  and speaking nobody holds a candle to RFK
*  I think who is neither Biden nor Trump. If you just say give a 10 minute
*  speech off the cuff RFK is going to give a way more charismatic way
*  more interesting speech than either of them. Agreed? Agreed.
*  So that's what I feel when I listen to him.
*  At the same time when I look throughout history
*  somehow I have a blanket skepticism of how much
*  change politicians can actually accomplish even good ones
*  in a system like America's where the president has intentionally very
*  limited power over domestic policy. They can actually make a lot of change in foreign
*  policy because they have kind of unilateral decision making ability.
*  And then secondly I always check myself
*  because I think the charismatic politicians
*  are always the ones that are able to lead people into really dark
*  corners. It's always the ones with charisma that are able to
*  use that charisma power to get people to support
*  things they never ordinarily would support. Well it's the old adage that no one
*  who wants to be president should be allowed to be president. Right.
*  And Hitler had charisma. Not from my perspective or your perspective
*  but as a historical fact if we were Germans living at that time we would
*  experience those Hitler speeches that look silly to us as charisma.
*  Have you seen the Hitler speeches with AI translation into English? No.
*  I've seen subtitles but they put the voice into English?
*  They changed the voice which is a new technology that they're actually employing with podcasts.
*  Spotify now has the ability to take this podcast with you and me.
*  And just for I think it's like 30 seconds of your voice and my voice
*  they can have us speak fluent German, Spanish and
*  French right now. And they're going to expand it to a bunch of different languages
*  and just put podcasts out in different languages for different countries.
*  That's awesome. Yeah it's fascinating. So they did it with Hitler. You should
*  watch it. We'll play it for you. Can we play it or will we get in trouble?
*  Let's find out. Let's find out. Because YouTube is
*  the jump, I can just say this, from just staying entirely on Spotify
*  to Nowhere Everywhere, dealing with YouTube is so
*  bizarre. Like people can claim copyright
*  for things that are 100% not theirs. Interesting. But if they claim it
*  then they can monetize your show.
*  They take all the money from your show. So then you have to remove it and then you have to fight it.
*  And you have to figure out, if you play two seconds of a song
*  is it two seconds? How many seconds? It's like over six
*  or something. Okay. Six seconds of a song they claim
*  they can monetize your entire podcast. It's fucking
*  bizarre. That's crazy. But it's dumb. It's dumb. There's things
*  that you should be able to talk about. If there's a popular song, you're like wet ass pussy.
*  Like look at the moral decline of America. Listen to this. I don't cook, I don't
*  clean, I got this wet ass pussy. It's like you should be able to play
*  that and just go what the fuck are we doing? This is wild. And
*  entertaining and fun and a great song. So this is Hitler and this is also
*  AI enhanced colorized too, which is interesting.
*  So when we would hear Hitler speak, what is that?
*  I was like we're going to crush the enemies and kill the Jews. That's all I thought
*  it was. A lot of it is... Let me start with the eighth seconds of the original.
*  Yeah, give me the original.
*  Okay, stop right there. Pause, pause. I hear that.
*  Hold on. I'm sorry. I hear that and I get terrified.
*  Oh yeah, because all of German sounds terrifying.
*  To the English ear, yeah. It's such a... It's such an aggressive language.
*  And when you hear Hitler yelling it, it's so aggressive.
*  And then when you hear what he's actually saying,
*  you're like, oh this is like a regular politician.
*  If yes, then stand up for me as I
*  have stood up for you. That's incredibly creepy.
*  Bizarre, right? Oh my god. Very bizarre. Wow.
*  Because we have these misconceptions, these preconceived notions, because obviously all the
*  evil things he actually wound up doing, which are real. But also
*  just the cultural filter of the way German sounds to the American ear.
*  It's a harsh language. Yes. Well there's many languages
*  like that. We just don't have a cultural context
*  to put that, especially the sounds. Have you heard
*  German Arabic? No.
*  This is Muslims speaking
*  with their German. So they have a German
*  accent. Oh, okay. And they're speaking in Arabic.
*  And it's very strange, because it's like you're hearing
*  both things. Right. And then there's also
*  people that are Muslims that are speaking in
*  Germany. And they're talking about
*  Islamic issues in German. It's strange, because you're looking at this Islamic cleric
*  speaking German. You're like, yo, this is wild. Wow.
*  There's something about those, Japanese is another one, when someone is
*  very aggressive. I find Japanese beautiful. It's beautiful. But I grew up
*  watching a lot of anime, and I think that influences it. Well, I was
*  influenced heavily by Japanese culture as a kid, obviously with martial arts.
*  But also by Miyamoto Musashi, who when I was
*  a young man, that book, The Book of Five Rings, was essentially
*  my guidebook for life. What is that about? It's a book
*  of strategy by this man, Miyamoto Musashi. And Miyamoto
*  Musashi was a Ronin who killed 60 men in one-on-one
*  combat. And he was arguably the most famous.
*  My whole right sleeve is Miyamoto Musashi.
*  And he wrote this book, The Book of Five Rings, and it was essentially
*  calling for a balanced life
*  to perfect your craft, no matter what it is.
*  But he was essentially saying that for someone to be a great warrior,
*  you also have to be a great poet. You have to be able to do calligraphy.
*  You have to be able to do art. You have to have a balance. You can't just be
*  this angry, emotional killing machine.
*  You will not see everything. You must be balanced.
*  And this is a guy that's speaking from intense
*  actual experience, sword fighting people,
*  which is probably the most intimate way to kill a man. And he got so good at it,
*  sometimes he would show up with wooden swords and kill people with wooden swords,
*  because he just didn't feel like their technique was good enough for him to justify
*  using an actual sword. So he'd beat them to death with oars.
*  So they would come at him with a sword, and he would have an oar from
*  a boat. And he would just fuck them up with an oar.
*  He was a fascinating guy. So I can see how you kind of reflect that.
*  You're like this big guy, and you do
*  mixed martial arts, but you also do yoga, and
*  you pay attention to the world. And so that kind of makes sense that that's where you
*  come from. Yeah, that was my guidebook. When I was a young man
*  and I was fighting, I was trying to figure out how to control my
*  emotions and my anxiety, and what's the most effective
*  way to approach something that's absolutely terrifying. Like how can you
*  approach it? Because you have to be scared. Because if you're not scared, you lose your edge.
*  You have to have an edge. Like every time that I ever competed
*  where I was overconfident, I fought terribly. Even if I won, I was
*  very ashamed of my performance. You have to be
*  scared. And it's something that no one wants to be. No one wants to be scared. It's an awful
*  feeling. Before you're competing, you're like, why am I even fucking doing this?
*  Why am I risking my literal life for no money
*  to do this thing that's fucking insane? Like I'm going to go out there and kick someone
*  in the face, and they're going to try to kick me in the face. And if I get hit, I'm going
*  unconscious. I'm going to the hospital. So I
*  read a bunch of psychology books. I read a bunch of self-help books.
*  I read a lot of Anthony Robbins stuff. I read
*  a lot of different things, trying to figure out what's the best way to manage the mind.
*  But the thing that I really gravitated towards was this one book.
*  Because of the history of this man and the way that he speaks. And he has
*  this quote that I use all the time. And if you've heard it before, I'm sorry, but I'm going to say it again.
*  Once you know the way broadly, you can see it in all
*  things. And this was what I applied.
*  I think you can apply it to many disciplines in life. But it's understanding
*  that to get great at something, to really
*  understand something, it requires this intensive
*  observation of what the thing is,
*  what your flaws are, what your strengths are, and approach it in this
*  very balanced way. And if you can do that, if you can really know the way,
*  you can apply that to everything you do. Whether it's learning how to play guitar,
*  or chess, or anything, or calligraphy,
*  or writing books, whatever it is. You can apply
*  that to all things. What you said about being scared and how
*  that's useful, you need to feel that in order to perform at the highest level.
*  It always makes me think of the Christopher Nolan Batman, where he has to, the second, the
*  Bane Batman, he has to take off the rope in order to have the
*  adrenaline to jump far enough to get out of the cave. Do you remember that scene?
*  I do not. Oh yeah, it's a brilliant scene and a brilliant
*  message, because Bane beats Batman, puts him at the bottom of this
*  deep pit. And he's trying to get out
*  so he can go back to Gotham and save everyone from the atomic bomb that's going to go off there.
*  And he keeps jumping and jumping, and there's one jump
*  he has to make that he keeps failing. And the prisoners have a way of doing it,
*  where they tie a rope around your waist so that when you inevitably
*  fall, as everyone always does. They've been trying to get out of this prison for years.
*  Some people have been stuck here their whole life. But there's a legend of a child that did it.
*  A child. No one's been able to figure out how
*  they replicate it, so they try with the rope all the time. And then one of the
*  elder statesmen of the scene says, well I heard the way that the child
*  did it is that they didn't use the rope. And you have to fear death
*  in order for your body to give you
*  the necessary fuel and material to land the jump.
*  There's a reason why you get scared. You need to be scared. There's a reason.
*  You know, Custamato, who is Mike Tyson's trainer, famously said
*  that fear is like a fire. You can cook food with it, or
*  if you let it run amok, it'll burn your house down.
*  And not to bring it back to the view, but I do sometimes feel
*  that about live television. I feel that when I know
*  it's live, and I know I'm not getting a second chance,
*  and I'm not getting a can you cut that out, and millions of people are going to see
*  this, my brain goes into a different mode of
*  aliveness, knowing what the stakes are.
*  And I think it probably causes me to perform better than normal.
*  Yeah, that's stand-up comedy, too. I imagine.
*  There's a lot of things like that. You have to be scared.
*  I get nervous every time I go on stage. I'm doing comedy forever.
*  I have to. I've done it when I don't get nervous. I don't do as well.
*  I need to get nervous. I get myself nervous. I pace, I move around, I stretch.
*  I go over my notes. I ramp my brain up. I think you have to.
*  I think you have to with anything that's very difficult to do.
*  I think maybe there's some people that are just on a certain spectrum of consciousness
*  that are able to just go zen
*  and go into a thing. And maybe there's different things that don't get you scared
*  that maybe being scared would be detrimental to those things, because you'd make quicker
*  judgments instead of measured and calculated.
*  The thing about being scared is generally things that are operating in a
*  time constraint. So you have this time constraint that's happening
*  that also gives you a certain amount of anxiety. There's a beginning and an end of every round, for instance.
*  And each round in kickboxing where I was doing
*  was three minutes. In MMA it's five minutes. And so you have this time constraint.
*  You have that. You have how many rounds you're going to have to do. That's in the back
*  of your head. You have all these things that keep you from being zen. All these things that
*  in the live aspect of it, and everyone's watching, that's
*  another thing. That's another element. What about archery and shooting? Those are probably the opposite, right?
*  Well archery, bow hunting is very much that.
*  Bow hunting. In the sense you want to be anxious a little bit?
*  Yeah. You're going to be, no matter what. You will be
*  anxious. But you must be able to perform
*  at your best and handle that anxiety. And there's a bunch of different
*  methods that people use to avoid open loop
*  thought processes. So an open loop thought process is like swinging a bat.
*  You really can't stop the bat once you're swinging it. You're swinging with all
*  your might and it's just this open loop. A closed loop process is something
*  where you're in control of it every step of the way. Like for instance, me opening up
*  this thing. I can stop right there. I don't just go, uh.
*  It's not like a thing that I can't control.
*  You can control it. And so when you're in a shooting
*  situation with archery, you have to think entirely
*  about the process of shooting. You can't just
*  go now. Because you'll be filled with anxiety. You'll move your arm. You'll twitch.
*  You have to be able to stay rock steady with something
*  that's not very steady. The beautiful thing about archery is the perfection of
*  doing something that's almost impossible to perfect. So when you can
*  have these brief moments where that arrow does
*  launch and goes right into that target, right where the X is.
*  This is this immense sense of elation, accomplishment.
*  But now when you're dealing with an animal, then you have all these other consequences.
*  Like you don't want to wound the animal. You want to be able to hit it and kill it very quickly with one shot.
*  And you have to practice thousands and thousands of arrows.
*  And then there's this one moment. It's not like fighting where you have multiple
*  opportunities to hit a guy. You can move. You can step to the side. This is the one
*  moment that the fight has actually happened. But there's a lot of moments in the fight.
*  You release that arrow that is the one moment. So you might have worked 11
*  months, 3 weeks, and 6 days for this
*  one moment. And you've been planning this elk hunt for the whole year.
*  You've gotten in shape for it. You've practiced all these arrows. But
*  when that elk steps out from between those trees at 60 yards
*  and you're at full draw, you have to center that pin right where its
*  vitals are. And you have to release a perfect arrow.
*  It's very, very hard to do. I've only gone shooting I think twice
*  or maybe three times. And just that moment right before
*  your body flinches in this way.
*  And so how does one get past that? You have to train.
*  Training is very important. You have to train with purpose. Like my friend Tim
*  Kennedy, when he shoots on a range, he puts dummy rounds in his gun.
*  So he'll have like 10 rounds that are real and then one
*  dummy round and then six rounds that are real. And he never knows where the dummy round is.
*  So when you're squeezing the trigger, you want to have like
*  a completely flat squeezing of the trigger. You don't want to do this.
*  You don't want to yank in anticipation of the recoil. And that's part of the problem with guns.
*  You flinch in anticipation of the recoil. And
*  when that bullet goes out of that gun, that flinch left
*  or right over the course of 100 yards could be a foot, two feet off the mark.
*  Who knows? Depending on how much you flinch.
*  And so that is a practice that some people employ. To learn
*  to be able to stay so steady no matter what where you're never
*  anticipating the recoil. All you're thinking about is the process of squeezing off.
*  So there's no recoil with a dummy round. Exactly. It doesn't go off. So you can see the evidence
*  of your own. Exactly. You pull the trigger but nothing happens. Because there's no real round.
*  It's just a rubber or whatever the fuck it is. I don't know if this is Hollywood, but I saw the movie
*  The Killer, David Fincher's latest movie. And I think he had
*  some kind of heart rate monitor where he wouldn't shoot until his heart rate was below 60
*  or something like that. I don't know to what extent that's Hollywood or
*  actually important. It's important. Yeah. And the best snipers
*  can most certainly control their heart rate. Yeah. There's
*  strategies. You learn breathing strategies to control your heart rate.
*  And there's also strategies
*  of mental management. Of not allowing
*  this, there's this tornado of anxiety that can
*  come on. And you have to see the winds blowing and go
*  you have to calm it down. You can't get caught up in it
*  in your mind. And I've seen people do it in many different things
*  in life. And you can apply it to many different things.
*  It's this overwhelming fear of fucking up.
*  Instead of thinking about what you're actually doing, you're thinking about the possibility of
*  fucking up, which leads you to fuck up, because that's what you're concentrating on. Right. In the game
*  of pool, if you think you're going to miss a shot, you most certainly
*  miss that shot. Almost always. You might get lucky and make it just like
*  I thought I was going to miss. But in your head, you're like, I hope I don't miss. I hope I don't miss.
*  You're going to miss. But if you just only concentrate on the process, you can
*  execute even under pressure. You can execute in a perfect line. Yeah. And
*  it's a mental management thing. And the only people that know
*  how to do that are people that have actually done difficult things under pressure.
*  And when you do difficult things under pressure, you realize, like, wow, there's so many
*  factors that you can probably mitigate
*  in some way through a strategy of control, of meditation, of thought,
*  of understanding what these thoughts are when they start to occur.
*  Yeah. I think a lot of anxiety management is deeply focusing on the task
*  at hand. Because if you're, you know, it's not necessarily
*  that the anxiety comes up and you're amazing at swatting it down,
*  it could be that you are so deeply focused on the thing itself
*  that there's no room for anxiety. And that's very lucky if you have that level
*  of focus and attention on whatever it is that you're passionate
*  about. It's like you're so upset. Like, someone like Michael Jordan or
*  Kobe Bryant, the way you hear them talking about winning,
*  you can understand why they didn't feel any anxiety when the buzzer beater
*  is coming up. There's two seconds they have to make the shot. It's because they're so
*  obsessed with winning that there's no room for anxiety. Right.
*  It's like it's life or death to them. Yeah. And there's no room for anxiety in those
*  situations. Yeah. You have to be, I mean, to perform at that level
*  too, you have to be really insane. You know, I would say that greatness
*  and that
*  real brilliance comes out of almost like a mental illness.
*  It really almost does. Because in order to be just so much
*  better at all the other high performers, because David Goggins has the best quote.
*  He says, you want to be uncommon amongst uncommon
*  people. That's him. But, you know, do you want to do what he does?
*  But that's how he's uncommon amongst uncommon people.
*  He's a fucking complete psycho. Totally, yeah. But that is how you become David Goggins.
*  You don't become David Goggins, but this mild mannered person who contemplates
*  and, you know, sits with his coffee and stares out the window and watches the birds.
*  And that's not, that's not, that's not how you get the job done.
*  No, not at all. And that's not how you become Michael Jordan either. You have to be
*  obsessed. I heard that if you beat Michael Jordan at pool, he wouldn't talk to you for weeks.
*  Yeah. That's a maladjusted person. In any other scenario,
*  that's a guy you can't really be friends with. Because, but
*  if you combine that with enormous natural talent and work ethic,
*  a little bit of good luck, that's Michael Jordan. I mean, the top, chess is the one
*  that I follow that's my hobby. And the top chess players are
*  absolute maniacs. Maniacs. These people, like, when they, they
*  actually, when you try to talk to them about their mistakes, you've had
*  Hikaru on. No, I have not. Oh, I don't know why I thought that. I would though.
*  So Hikaru, best player in America, absolute legend. You know, if
*  Magnus Carlsen died in his crib, Hikaru, it's very
*  possible Hikaru would be world champ for a very long time. Wow.
*  But what separates him from Magnus Carlsen? Just
*  Magnus, I think Hikaru once put it,
*  Magnus is a little bit better than Hikaru at everything.
*  A little bit better at openings, a little bit better at calculation, a little bit
*  better at end games. You put it all together and he's just the goat.
*  He can't be beat. What was your take? To the point where he got so bored, he got
*  so bored of winning the world championship that he said, I don't want to do it
*  anymore. Wow. Yeah, so he's technically no longer world champion
*  because he's so bored of winning. And it's actually
*  understandable. I don't even think anyone's mad at him because these world championship
*  chess matches, 14 games, they
*  can go six hours a game, they can actually go over six hours a game.
*  Brutal, absolutely, like if you thought taking the SAT
*  and trying really hard made you mentally exhausted, it's nothing compared to how these
*  guys feel after a six hour chess game. And doing that 14 days in a row,
*  spending six months prior to that, working with chess engines to find one
*  new idea in an opening, 50 moves in,
*  it's absolutely grueling. And he does it every time and he wins every time,
*  but he says, I can't, this is not fun for me anymore. So I'm going to play all the other
*  chess tournaments that you just kind of show up and do your best
*  and he crushes most of those as well. But I'm not doing this grueling,
*  I can't live my life like this anymore. That's interesting because that is
*  John Jones too. John Jones, when he was dominating the light heavyweight division,
*  he got to a point where the way analysts would describe it is that he was playing with his food.
*  And that he wasn't afraid of losing to these guys.
*  And he barely trained for some of them. Like he had a
*  famous fight with Alexander Gustafson. And it was the first fight where John
*  had ever been taken down and he got pushed deep into the rounds. And John rallied in
*  the fourth and fifth rounds and won the fight. And it was a crazy fight.
*  They had a rematch and John prepared and just dominated him and
*  annihilated him. Same guy. I mean he just ran right through him. The guy was
*  still in his prime, John was still in his prime, there was not like
*  a bunch of things that had happened that deteriorated him. Nope. It was a couple
*  years later and John ran through him. And that's the real John
*  Jones. It's just the John Jones that was fighting all these other guys. He wasn't challenged.
*  He was the goat. And he knew he was the goat. And so he
*  didn't, I talked to his coaches, he literally didn't train for the Gustafson
*  fight. But yet still pulled it off in the fourth and fifth rounds. Just out of
*  sheer greatness and toughness and grit and
*  experience. Pulled it off and it wasn't in condition. It wasn't prepared.
*  But still good enough to beat the very best challenger he ever faced
*  in the toughest fight of his career in the last rounds. Yep. And the thing with these
*  kind of guys, I don't know about fighting, probably the same, but with the chess guys
*  you try to bring up a mistake, a famous mistake that they made.
*  And it's almost like you're talking about a family member who died tragically.
*  It means that much to them that they made a mistake 12 years ago
*  on move 24 of some games that threw the match. I mean that's how hard
*  these guys take it. Which is, again, in you or me, that's
*  just a maladjusted guy. That's like a guy with a problem that needs to go to therapy.
*  In a top performer, that's what makes him a top performer and separates
*  him from the otherwise very good professionals. 100%. There's a guy who's
*  arguably the greatest pool player of all time, at least one of the greatest pool players of all
*  time, his name's Earl Strickland. He's this American guy who won the US Open five times.
*  It's only one of the guys who won the US Open five times. A guy named Shane Van Boening who's
*  another genius player. But Earl, like,
*  he would play with this insane intensity.
*  If he missed a ball, he was, like, confused.
*  Like, how is it possible that I can miss? There was a million
*  dollar challenge. Now this is statistically
*  so impossible to do under intense
*  competition that they were willing to gamble and get an insurance
*  policy that would give someone a million dollars if they could
*  run ten racks in a row of nine ball. Now the way nine ball
*  works is you have nine balls and you shape them where
*  the bottom balls are missing, which would make fifteen, which is a full racks, right? So it's
*  this, like, triangle sort of a rack. And then
*  you break the balls and the one ball is
*  in the front and the nine ball is in the center. Now the balls scatter randomly.
*  And you have to run them in order. So every
*  single rack you have to have a shot on the one or the
*  lowest number ball. And then you have to have balls that aren't clustered together
*  or you have to figure out how to break up those clusters and still get a shot.
*  Do you have to break it strategically? You kind of can,
*  but back then they didn't. Guys are much better now because there's a thing called
*  the magic rack. And what the magic rack is, it's a clear piece of plastic
*  that the balls set in where the balls are always touching, always, in the exact
*  same spots because they're literally sitting in a pattern. And so then
*  these guys are breaking the balls more softly, which causes, they do what's
*  called a cut break, which causes the one ball to go drift into the side
*  pocket. And the best guys can do it like nine out of ten times.
*  And then the two ball bounces up table and they know exactly where all the balls are going to be. And you see
*  similar patterns over and over again. What Earl Strickland was doing was smashing
*  the balls and they'd scatter around. And he ran
*  ten racks in a row for a million dollars. And he did it.
*  And he did it. But everyone's like it's never been done in a tournament before.
*  The first tournament where they get this insurance policy, Earl does it. Not only did he run
*  ten, it was a race to eleven. He broke and ran the eleventh
*  too. And he made a combination on the nine for the million dollars.
*  Which is just fucking insane. And not a short combination either.
*  Distance from the pocket. So to be that guy
*  you have to be out of your fucking mind. There's no other way.
*  You have to be completely obsessed with the game. You have to be completely
*  obsessed with all the details. He does commentary on pool
*  matches. It's fascinating to listen to him do commentary. Cause he talks about different
*  English you gotta use with this shot and different things you have to avoid.
*  Nine times out of ten the player does something different than he would have done
*  and you see him get fucked. Like yep that was all I was talking about.
*  He sees it coming. Sees the whole table in a
*  different way than a person who's a novice sees the table.
*  Only things I've ever been that obsessed with I think in my life are music.
*  I'm a trombone player. And that was actually my career before I
*  started writing. I still am actually a professional trombone player. You talk like a jazz guy.
*  Yeah yeah yeah. Well I am a jazz guy. Joe I had a
*  my life path is that I graduated high school. I was considered
*  one of the top professional jazz trombonists in the country.
*  Went to Juilliard which is the most selective school for that.
*  And that was my whole career. Like that was I had
*  this whole other career I've had was a pivot from all of that.
*  And how did it start? Basically so I was at Juilliard as a freshman
*  at Juilliard in New York City gigging
*  as a jazz trombone player. And my mom died
*  when I was 18. And of
*  cancer. And it just shattered everything for me. Sent me down
*  into a grief and depression. And
*  I had always been interested in philosophy and writing as well kind of as a side thing. And I was always
*  a very good student in school. But my passion was music. But something
*  about the experience of my mom dying led me to reflect
*  on what I wanted out of life. And I dropped out of Juilliard
*  and applied to Columbia. And so I realized I could still do
*  music. Nobody learns music in school.
*  So being in New York City I could still play as much music as I
*  wanted to. But I could also get a liberal arts degree and feed that side of myself.
*  And it was had my mom not died I probably just would have stayed at Juilliard.
*  Might have had a whole different life. Well that's fascinating. Is this you? Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah that's me with a big afro. That's amazing.
*  That's in high school I think. When I was 8 years old I lived in San Francisco
*  and our teacher took us to see Dizzy Gillespie. Oh yeah amazing. And it was
*  wild. And for folks who don't know yeah Dizzy Gillespie his cheeks
*  puff out like a frog. Which is the I mean you would tell me that's not
*  how they teach you how to do it. Absolutely not. And what he was able to do with his cheeks was
*  I guess just years and years of stretching his skin.
*  Because he had done it for so long. Oh yeah. Like look at that. I mean it's look at that. That's a full
*  pressure extension of the cheeks. No trumpet player would teach you to play like
*  that but he was one of the greats of early jazz
*  trumpet playing and he made it work and I don't know that you know I've never
*  heard that he had any health issues from playing that way.
*  You know a lot of trumpet players they get older and you know Freddie Hubbard who's one of the greatest
*  jazz trumpet players famously had a growth on his lip that kind of
*  inhibited him in his last decade. From the pressure of the. Yeah yeah.
*  From pressing it against his lips and he had a growth.
*  I don't know if it was cancerous or not but it really messed him up. So it just becomes so irritated
*  that a growth developed there. Oh yeah. That makes sense. Yeah.
*  But yeah that's not healthy but it worked for Dizzy. And that's
*  the thing all the rules can be broken if you're good enough. Yes. Right. Yeah
*  all the rules. I mean and also he just figured out his way to do it.
*  He just figured out a way to do it that's like not a way that you would ever teach.
*  Yeah. There's a lot of that though. There's Slide Hampton one of the great
*  jazz trombone players of all time played left handed which
*  he's the only person I've ever heard of great or
*  or not who plays left handed. In other words the slide arm is always the
*  right arm but somebody gave it to him wrong. And that's
*  how he played it. And I've heard. He plays it upside down. He plays it left side
*  right. In other words every trombone player is crafted. Sorry
*  every trombone is meant to be played with the right hand but somebody set it
*  up must have set it up wrong when they gave it to him. And I've heard stories
*  of. So even left handed people would do it. Oh
*  100 percent of left handed trombone players play with the right hand. 100 percent.
*  But I've heard and slide is one of the greats.
*  There's actually a great video of him playing at Dizzy Gillespie's birthday party
*  which is a famous video. But he
*  I've heard of this with guitar players where somebody gave it
*  Hendrix. Yeah I didn't know that. I didn't realize that. He played it
*  left handed. Yeah he played it like. Rather this way. Jamie you know
*  right arm on the neck. Hendrix was left. I was thinking the Kurt Cobain I think
*  he played it upside down maybe. Right didn't he? Something like that.
*  You have to restring the guitar. Yeah you'd have to. He always went the low E string to be
*  the top I guess closest to you. Right. And then some people wouldn't restring it
*  because they weren't told to or however. Yeah they just started playing the other way. What was Hendrix's deal?
*  I think he was just lefty. I feel like he
*  was playing a right handed guitar though. I feel like he played a
*  right handed guitar lefty. Hendrix also played his guitar upside down. Yeah.
*  Why he played it upside down.
*  He also self taught which is to me the most fascinating.
*  He couldn't find a left handed guitar. Which they probably did make his mini back in the past. Yeah they probably didn't.
*  Especially if you don't have any money. You're saying he took a normal guitar and put it to the right.
*  Just flipped it around. So the low string was high and the high string was low. Yeah.
*  So he must have had all his own fingerings. I mean his
*  sound was so different than anyone before him. Yeah.
*  There's leaps in music but the leaps that Hendrix took
*  they're so different than everybody else.
*  It's so hard because I listen to his music today constantly and I love it.
*  But I don't live in 1967. It's not.
*  It's a different world. And I feel like if you were alive then
*  and you heard Voodoo Child you'd be like what the fuck.
*  For sure. Standing next to a mountain I chop it down
*  with the edge of my hand and then you hear that music and you're like oh my.
*  By the way not a great singing voice. And nobody gave a fuck.
*  Nobody gave a fuck about his singing voice. Yeah. It was his music
*  was so powerful. The sound. I wish we could
*  play it right now. Just the beginning of Voodoo Child.
*  That riff. You have to understand there's nothing like that in
*  music before him. There's a lot of that now.
*  Yeah well because of it. Because of it. Like Stevie Ray Vaughan. And that's what happens.
*  You can never really go back with the ears of those people and hear it as they heard it
*  because now you've taken for granted that this way of playing has seeped into the culture.
*  Exactly. This is what I always tell people that disparage Lenny Bruce.
*  Give me some of that.
*  Dude I could run over a fucking mountain if I hear that.
*  That's still pretty fucking awesome. Oh it's amazing. I could run over a fucking mountain with that in my ears.
*  That's a drug. That song is a drug.
*  That song has like a physical power it imparts on you.
*  I get goosebumps just hearing it.
*  But that guy we have to understand there was nothing like that.
*  There was nothing like that. You had fucking Love Love Me Do.
*  You had like Buddy Holly and shit.
*  You had great music but you didn't have anybody who played guitar like that.
*  And this guy was blowing away.
*  People like Eric Clapton famously saw him and was like what am I doing?
*  And he was like it's Eric Clapton with the greatest guitarist of all time.
*  He's like oh my god I fucking suck. I fucking suck.
*  This guy is changing everything. He's just a different thing.
*  A guy who comes along who is so beyond what's being currently expressed.
*  That everybody has to move towards him.
*  Yeah so every Monday night I play trombone at the Comedy Cellar.
*  We have a band at the Olive Tree Cafe.
*  We play on Monday nights and we got two guitar players.
*  One of them is this guy Nick Casparino that's just absolutely impossible to describe.
*  Just absolute killer.
*  They're all great singers. Nick and Colin and Mike.
*  And me and my friend Dan are the horn section basically.
*  We play like 9 to midnight every week. We have such a good time there.
*  And the comics are always coming in, hanging out.
*  We play every genre. Like truly multi-genre.
*  It's just an amazing experience.
*  Wow that's awesome man. I'm glad you still enjoy that too.
*  And now it's like a pure thing. You just do it just for the pure art of it.
*  That was really what I realized when I was 18.
*  Taking every jazz trombone gig that came my way and paid me $50 and a slice of pizza.
*  This is my passion life. I love this. But this is going to drive me into insanity.
*  I'm going to have to take every single gig of my whole life and eke out an existence.
*  So maybe I should get a degree and just see where shit goes.
*  That's how a lot of comics feel in the beginning of their career as well.
*  The comedy thing is very hard in the beginning.
*  It's a real gauntlet that you have to traverse.
*  You have to go through a lot of shit in order to become...
*  I did a couple open mics. I've always loved comedy and I had some friends in it.
*  I did open mics, had a good time. Didn't bomb. Didn't do great. Did okay.
*  But the bug didn't bite you.
*  The bug didn't bite me. That's exactly right. And the thing is I knew what the bug meant because I have it for music.
*  And so I knew what it's like to be like, I suck at this but I love it so much that I'm going to keep doing it until I don't suck.
*  Because with trombone and trumpet there's no such thing as being good when you start.
*  There's some people that the first time they sing in church everyone is like, this kid can sing.
*  There's no such thing as that for trombone or trumpet for brass instruments.
*  Everyone eats shit the first time they play.
*  And so if you just love it so much that you're okay and you have a family that's forgiving enough to hear you be terrible,
*  which I luckily did, that's how you get good at those things.
*  And I didn't have that for comedy even though I love comedy as a consumer.
*  Well I love music as a consumer. And I don't have that for music.
*  But I worry I would. Gary Clark was in here and he gave me his guitar and he f***ed me.
*  He put my fingers in the right place. It does feel good.
*  I started getting scared. This could take me over.
*  Yeah I'm worried. That's why I want to play golf. There's a lot of things I won't do.
*  You think you're going to get into golf too much.
*  I am terrified. All my friends like Jamie and Tony and Ron White, they're obsessed.
*  My friends who play golf are all obsessed with golf.
*  So what is it that's so addicting about golf in particular?
*  Jamie?
*  I've played many times.
*  It's like the same thing you were saying earlier with pool.
*  The same description. Sorry with archery I meant.
*  The consequences obviously are less. You're not going to miss
*  and hurt something. Well there's target archery though, it's very intensive too.
*  But when you were describing when it all goes right, which is so rare.
*  I think there's something Samuel L. Jackson said recently where in golf you shoot
*  if you're bad it's 100 shots around, if you're really good 75.
*  Most of those still though, you don't ever really do the intention
*  of what you're trying to do. Which is going the hole right from where you are.
*  Right where you were aiming or anything. So it's a bunch of mistakes.
*  How good are you at overcoming those mistakes, clearing your head every time,
*  fighting against nature, also having fun with your friends,
*  being out in nature, getting away from everything for 4 or 5 hours, having a couple beers.
*  Clearing your head. But it's like clearing your head because you can't think of all a bunch of other stuff
*  or it will ruin your whole day because you can't have fun out there.
*  Do you remember that Kevin Costner movie where he plays this badass pitcher?
*  It might have been a league of her own.
*  No, there's another movie where he's like a retired pitcher.
*  So he has this thing where everybody's like, he wasn't retired, he was pitching in the movie.
*  For the love of the game. For the love of the game, that's it.
*  And so he has this moment, like when he's on the mound, where he goes
*  clear the mechanism. And everything just
*  fades out and he just looks at the strike zone.
*  And you don't hear the crowd anymore. It's a really cool scene.
*  Here, we'll play the scene but we won't do it for everybody else.
*  Yo, Jaffal!
*  You suck!
*  You stink on ass!
*  Clear the mechanism.
*  Nice.
*  Nice. Yeah, my friend Colton uses that when he goes bow hunting.
*  He says clear the mechanism. It's what it feels like to put on Bozie headphones.
*  Just force your mind in this state of hyper focus.
*  I wanted to ask you this.
*  What was your take on Magnus Carlsen and that young man
*  who apparently has... Hans? Yes. Hans Nieman.
*  Yeah. So explain the story for people.
*  So basically what happened is there's this grandmaster named Hans Nieman
*  who's a young guy. Probably early 20s.
*  Magnus is probably more like 31 or so like now.
*  And what happened is
*  Hans Nieman, he beat Magnus Carlsen
*  at a tournament in a game. Not in a match necessarily.
*  You might need to check that. But he beat him in the first game of the tournament.
*  Which happens, right? Like even... It's kind of like how the best tennis player
*  in the world can lose a game to a lesser player but probably isn't going to lose the match.
*  That happens pretty frequently in chess. Not uncommon.
*  But it is the most uncommon with Magnus. Magnus suspected
*  Hans of cheating. Why did he suspect Hans of cheating? Magnus is not the type
*  to assume someone is cheating just because he lost a game. He's never done that
*  in his entire career. The reason he did it in the case of Hans is because
*  there had long been rumors circulating in the chess world
*  that Hans Nieman was a cheater. Now there's ways you can cheat in chess
*  in an over-the-board game if we're playing with a physical set in front of us.
*  The one way people do it is they'll have a friend
*  generally that is looking at the game either here or out in the hall
*  running it through an engine and giving you a little signal like cheating
*  like a baseball coach would.
*  There are also rumors that in principle it's possible to cheat
*  with a device. And I think that's happened in some way that
*  someone can transmit to you, be looking at the game and transmit you a signal
*  here's the right move with a certain number of buzzes if I have a buzzer in my pocket.
*  In principle it's possible to have a buzzer in
*  the orifices of your body. In your butt essentially.
*  And this is part of why it went viral is because there was a theory
*  that they have pretty strict security at these places so where would he have put the device?
*  They're not doing an anal cavity check. So that was
*  part of the reason people were talking about it so much because that's just hilarious to contemplate.
*  But the real situation of it was that Magnus made
*  some strong implied comments that Hans had cheated in the game.
*  Then everyone started looking at the Hans and the rumors that had long existed
*  in the chess world about this guy became public and there were serious competing
*  investigations of how is it that this guy
*  rose so quickly for example. It's very uncommon in the chess
*  world for someone to raise in rating that quickly
*  in the professional world. There's a normal rate at which people get better
*  and there's a kind of impossible rate at which people got better and
*  people debated. He had defenders, he had attackers, both of them had
*  some good points about his rise in over the board play.
*  Then there's the online cheating which is a totally different story.
*  Because chess.com has one of the, really the state of the art
*  cheating detection mechanism. And people cheat all the time
*  on chess.com which is crazy because there's no reason for it.
*  Someone like me, I pay whatever I pay every month on chess.com
*  I'm a random amateur player, I like playing when I'm on the subway, I like playing my friend
*  occasionally. You don't get any money for winning. Most of us have
*  anonymous user names. You don't get bragging rights for winning. And yet
*  there's a certain percentage of people like me on chess.com that just cheat.
*  For no reason. They're just sitting at home in their mother's basement cheating
*  to get a number on a screen that means nothing and it wants them no money.
*  To me then it makes complete sense. Really? Why? Because of video games.
*  Because in video games people would use bots when you'd play online. So an aiming
*  bot would make it so that you would almost never miss. So you would play a guy
*  and like say in Quake, there's a gun called the rail gun.
*  The rail gun is very difficult to hit someone with but it imparts the most damage.
*  But it doesn't have a scatter of damage. Like a rocket, you could shoot a
*  rocket next to a guy and fuck him up. But it won't hurt him as much as a
*  rail gun which would kill him almost instantly. Unless he has a specific amount of armor.
*  And there's some guys who would never miss. They just hit you with that rail gun every time your
*  head poked out. It would be impossible for them to know exactly where you were going to be
*  for the amount of time, unless it was dumb luck. But you can't have dumb luck 9 times
*  in a row. 10 times in a row, 20 times in a row, 50 times in a row.
*  It would be scores like 50 to 0 against really good players.
*  And it's not for any money. They're just laughing because they're
*  clowning you with a bot. It's fun. Yeah, so that's what people do on
*  chess.com. And just like that game where you literally mathematically
*  can only have so much good luck, chess.com has algorithms that are
*  really really good at detecting when you've gone from the good luck space to the
*  definitely cheating space. So how do they know? So they looked at
*  Hans Nieman's games and they found that he was almost certainly
*  cheating on chess.com in certain games. And they
*  did a whole report where they highlighted the specific games. Can I stop you?
*  Is it an analysis of his previous games? So you see
*  the level of competency based on the previous games?
*  What do you mean? So you see his level of mistakes and
*  the way he does it. And then in the games where they think he's cheating,
*  what was the variable that they detected?
*  So one variable that they use is the length of time
*  between your moves. Because in a normal chess match,
*  it's a bit random, right? You'll do some moves quickly
*  and some moves slowly. But if you're cheating, you're using a machine
*  that takes five seconds to load for every move, checking the move, you might
*  have, you're going to have a regularity. Each move is going to come after five seconds, for
*  example. So that's one factor. And then they have other
*  factors. Another factor is just how high, how accurate your moves
*  are. Because chess is close to solved, meaning
*  the machines are playing it better than we are. So you can check a human player against
*  the machine player. Even Magnus Carlsen will lose a thousand times in a row
*  now to Stockfish. A thousand times. He has no chance. I remember when Big
*  Blue first started playing chess against people, that was always the thing.
*  Once a computer can beat a person, we're fucked. Yeah, we're way long past
*  that now. That's wild. And so they can check, if you're playing
*  99.5% of the Stockfish top moves,
*  that's just not possible. Magnus can't do it, nobody can do it. You might
*  be able to do it for one simple game, but you can't do it 12 games in a row
*  that are complicated. It's just not possible. Very much like what you talked about. So
*  chess.com combines that measure with these other measures.
*  It even kind of knows, I think, when you're switching browsers, which can be a tip off
*  to cheating, because you're switching from the chess browser you're playing chess into, to the browser
*  that you're cheating with. Why wouldn't they just
*  have a separate computer? Exactly. So that's not the only thing. They could have
*  well, if generally they require you now to have a camera.
*  If you're competing in a tournament, so you have to show your surroundings so that they know
*  you're not using a separate computer. But you could have someone
*  off camera that was cheating for you. In theory, yep. You could have a dual monitor
*  set up and so on. Yep, yep. But the algorithm
*  is regarded as very accurate
*  in terms of determining cheating, and they did determine that he had cheated
*  in a bunch of, let's say they weren't
*  top tournaments, but they were friendly tournaments. Some of them had money on the line.
*  So it was never proven that he cheated
*  over the board. And I'm agnostic about that. I've read both sides. I don't
*  have a strong opinion about whether he had cheated over the board in real big
*  tournaments, but it was proven that he had cheated online.
*  And again, all of this is separate from the fact that he's a damn
*  good chess player. Like nobody denies he is a grandmaster. He should
*  be a grandmaster. He is capable of defeating Magnus Carlsen in a
*  game, not in a match. So that's not to take anything away from him.
*  But there was rumors circulating, and that's basically what happened.
*  And so his defense was, I believe he admitted to some of it. Yes.
*  And his defense was that he was doing that because he wanted to get
*  higher ratings quicker so he could play better players. Okay, well.
*  Still cheating. Still cheating. Every chess player wants to do that.
*  Right. Why don't they all cheat? It's not an excuse. It's not.
*  Also, I think he said he was 16 at the time. But then there was some evidence
*  that he did it when he was 19 too. Yeah, that's right. That's right. He under-exaggerated
*  the...he downplayed it. He downplayed it even in his admission.
*  But again, he's a damn good chess player.
*  And he has a fiery personality, which so many of these
*  chess guys, unfortunately, are just so freaking boring from the audience
*  perspective that when you get a guy there that's like shit-talking
*  and being braggadocious
*  and stuff, it's really entertaining to watch because it's so rare. So many chess
*  players, I love them. They're a little bit autistic. They're on the spectrum.
*  That's not to cast aspersions. It's just true. Right. And so from an entertainment
*  point of view, I think he's very good for the chess world. So he talks shit
*  while he plays? He talks shit after the game. Oh. Talks shit after the game.
*  I want to see some shit-talking while he plays. Like Washington Square Park shit?
*  Do those guys have those challenge matches? I've lost a lot of money to those guys.
*  That's the fun thing. They're great though. When those guys are talking shit and they're slapping that clock,
*  that's an entertaining chess. They'll crush you every time. But wouldn't that be like
*  better to have, like, if you want more, I guess they don't really care if more people pay attention to it.
*  The purity of it. No, they do care. Chess.com definitely cares. They've had a huge
*  influence in upping chess as an audience,
*  you know, a sport that audiences watch. The move is like the searching for Bobby Fisher move.
*  Just get him out there in the park. Oh, yeah. That's fun. Yeah. Those,
*  I watch regular chess because I'm fascinated by it. But, and I
*  know how the pieces move, but I really don't know how to play. I'm terrible. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But, I love watching those guys. I love watching people sit down
*  and talk shit. Yep. And I love when like a real grandmaster sits down and talks shit.
*  Because like some of them are like real, like high level tournament
*  players that get in there and mix it up with those dudes. They do. Like, oh, I see what you're doing.
*  Are you talking some shit here? Yeah. And the guys at the park are usually
*  just a little bit worse than the kind of like mid level professionals. So the
*  mid level professionals will beat them. And the guys do not like to be beat. Because
*  think about it. They're sitting there making money all day. Yeah. Occasionally
*  encountering douchebags that think that they can beat them. Right?
*  And then someone comes along who really can beat them and they don't like to lose. Of course.
*  They do not like to lose. I mean, for example, there was one time, I've never beaten one of the
*  main guys. So I'm just going to be honest about that. Never even come close to beating
*  any of the main guys at Washington Square or Union Park in New York. And I never will.
*  But one day there was like a sub there. Not one of the normal guys.
*  And I was beating him. I was so excited. It was the first time.
*  I was like, I'm tired of losing all my money to these people. And
*  one of his friends came over, saw that I was winning, because it was
*  obvious I was winning. And the guy made some kind of innocent comment.
*  And the guy I'm playing goes, oh, well he's helping you now.
*  The game's void. And I was like, oh, come on, dude.
*  Come on. You're just saying that because you're losing.
*  But I let him have it. I was like, screw it. Yeah, you don't want to get in a fight with those dudes.
*  No, some of them are really weird. A lot of them are high. A lot of them are drunk during the day.
*  I was watching one where this grandmaster was playing, one of those guys, and the guy
*  moved his piece in a funny way. He like went back and forth
*  and put it in a different spot. And he's like, hey, I saw what you did.
*  That's how he did there. Oh yeah, the video with Maurice Ashley? That's him.
*  Oh, that's the best. He catches the guy moving the piece.
*  Maurice is beating his ass. And he, I think he, yeah, he's sweating.
*  He does a little magician's trick. But Maurice catches it.
*  And this is, we can't play it, unfortunately. The volume will get in trouble. But yeah, he busted
*  him doing it.
*  See what he did there? That's what he did. Yep, yep, yep.
*  Don't try the trickery now.
*  I like the way you did that.
*  Yeah, hilarious.
*  That would 100%, that would probably work on me. But that's not going to work on a grandmaster. And he didn't know
*  that this was Maurice Ashley. He just thought this was some random guy. So now his ego was involved.
*  I can't lose to some rando. And so he tries to pull a fast one. But nope,
*  not on a grandmaster. And a grandmaster is very confident and smiling.
*  Doesn't seem like he's under pressure at all. No, not at all. But that little magic trick,
*  I mean, how often does that guy do that? Because he did it so smooth. I'd never know.
*  It was so smooth the way he did it. Super smooth, yep. You know, it's like,
*  it's three card Monte in chess form. Right. Yeah.
*  Well, pool hustlers do that too. What do they do?
*  They'll pretend to miss. They'll move things with their stick.
*  If they know that your game is really good, they'll cheat. They'll cheat in ways where you don't see it.
*  They'll guide a ball in if they know that your angle is
*  where you can't see what's going on. Right. And then also, they'll miss on purpose.
*  That's the whole thing of pool hustling, is playing below your speed until the money gets raised.
*  The whole thing about pool hustling is get a guy to think that he can win.
*  So let him win. And then maybe you
*  almost win, but lose. And you get upset and you want to try it again.
*  You lose confidence. Like, yeah, let's do it again. And then you lose big.
*  And then you say double or nothing. He's like, fuck yeah, double or nothing.
*  And then you play really good. And then he's like, fuck!
*  And so now the bet is gone from one thousand to five thousand
*  to one set for ten grand. Right. And you know, you're
*  up six grand, so you think you got this. And then he beats you. And he's like,
*  there's no way. Fuck that. Let's do it again. And then you do it again. And now he plays even better.
*  Like, he might be playing even when he's playing good at like seventy percent of his speed.
*  Right. To make you think he had a lucky one. Yeah. I had a friend who
*  used to do that. He was a musician who
*  was a genius. He was just a crazy person who lived as a
*  pool hustler. He was always homeless. The whole time I knew him, he was like,
*  staying on people's couches and sleeping in flop houses and shit.
*  And he's addicted to drugs. But he was the kind of guy that you could do
*  math. He could do it in his head. Like, you could have a calculator. We would do it
*  at the pool hall. We would say, three hundred sixty nine divided by seven plus five minus
*  two. And he would bang out the number. Wow. And it was like that. That's crazy.
*  He'd be like, what the fuck, man? Well, he would pretend he sucks. So he was like a fat guy.
*  And he would just show up in pool halls. And he was real loud and talking
*  shit. And then he'd miss. And when he'd miss, he'd fucking fall down. Fuck!
*  He'd like bang his stick on the ground and sweat and go to the bathroom and wash his face and come
*  back out. And these guys, they thought they had him. We got this guy.
*  We got this guy. And then he starts winning. And he starts winning just barely.
*  And you're like, oh, he's going to fall apart. And he starts winning barely more. And then
*  they would get angry and he would maybe lose a game.
*  And then they'd get back to it. And then by the end of the night, they don't even know what the
*  fuck happened. Because they're watching this guy who now looks like a world champion. And he's just
*  running out from everywhere. Like, what the fuck? People also got really mad,
*  though. Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah. I could get you beat up. Oh, that's the movie The Hustler.
*  They break his hands. They break his thumbs. Yeah. That's
*  the thing that would happen. So you have to know how much you can win. And you have
*  to know when to lose. Right. And sometimes you have to lose money just to
*  get out of there with your life. You got to agree to play another game and then fall
*  apart just to get out of there. And then maybe you can come back and play them again.
*  There's guys that will lose weeks in a row to set up a big game.
*  Weeks. They'll come back in and lose. Can you imagine conning for that long?
*  Oh, yeah. Those guys are good. It was the part of the craft.
*  I can't imagine it. But that was the way they made money. That was the part of the craft.
*  And you didn't want to be known. So the best players back in the day would not
*  enter tournaments. The best players are these legendary guys that you would hear
*  that were just playing in pool halls. And then eventually pool got to a point
*  where it was on television. They started making money. And
*  guys became known. There's a guy named Buddy Hall who's one of the most
*  famous money players of all time. And then eventually he just starts playing tournaments.
*  Now everybody knows him anyway. He can't get a game. He's Buddy Hall.
*  They used to call him Rags. That was his initial game. A lot of these guys have fake names.
*  Efren Reyes, who's arguably the greatest of all time. He came up from the Philippines
*  and he said he was Cesar Morales. Because even in the Philippines
*  everybody knew who Efren was. Even when he was in his 20s he was a
*  wizard. They call him the magician. He was a wizard on a pool table.
*  And when he came up to America they weren't even sure. They were like, just to be safe
*  let's come up with a fake name. And he just robbed everybody
*  at these tournaments. Just robbed everybody in gambling. He could play
*  so much better than everybody. He changed the game. Sort of like Hendrix
*  changed music. Efren changed pool. And a lot of people
*  they play, there's a lot of things, particularly safety play
*  that they learn from watching Efren. What's safety play?
*  So say if you're playing nine ball and you're running the balls in order.
*  If I have a shot on the one ball, but I don't have a clear shot
*  I will knock the one ball into a position
*  and hide the cue ball behind other balls. That makes it bad for you.
*  Now you have to hit that lower numbered ball. If you don't hit the ball
*  I get ball in hand. So you not only have to hit it, but you have to also one ball
*  either the cue ball or the object ball has to hit a rail after you hit it.
*  So you have to kick. And so kicking is you're shooting into the rails
*  to try to make it rebound off the rail and collide perfectly with this ball
*  over a nine foot table. And Efren was just a wizard at it.
*  He would do it in a way, not only would he kick the ball, he would kick it in
*  a lot of the time. And now guys play to kick balls in
*  all the time. Because they learned it from Efren. Like three rail kicks
*  where you're cutting into a corner. They know the exact spot on the table to hit
*  with the exact amount of speed and spin to make it land right in front of that ball
*  and nudge it into the pocket. But that's all
*  learning from these people
*  that came kind of out of nowhere.
*  These pool players were all these sort of
*  shady characters that were hiding out in these pool halls in Louisiana and pretending
*  they're like a painter. They'd come in with paint all over their over halls
*  and shit. And they'd be walking in like a hayseed
*  and just talk real stupid and drink a bunch. And then people would
*  get curious. Especially if there's some traveling salesman from out of town
*  and he thinks he's a bad ass and plays a little pool and he's got some money in his pocket.
*  Next thing you know, this guy's robbing you. Table tennis is my
*  other hobby. Really? Yeah. Really? I play at this place called Ping Pod
*  in New York. They have a bunch of locations. You can go there for
*  not 15 bucks or so. Just play with your friend for an hour or they have
*  tournaments. It's really fun. That's a wild
*  game. I love it. That's a wild game to watch too. I'm always
*  stunned that ping pong never became as popular as tennis.
*  Because it's so accessible and it's so fun to
*  watch and to play. Like you can play it. People can play it. Lower barrier to
*  entry too. Yes. But also at the highest level, insanely
*  impressive. Absolutely insane. I was watching this volley where these people
*  were like 7, 10 feet away from the table. Oh yeah. And
*  super high speed and diving back and forth and back and forth
*  and it's like ah ah ah. And the volley's insane. And when someone does score
*  you're like wow. Yeah the reflexes are just incredible.
*  Amazing. And so many different moves because you're dealing with something that's coming at
*  you over this low thing very fast.
*  And you're doing it this way and this way and that way and gentle and fast
*  and there's all these different sneaky tactics. Oh yeah. God I love it.
*  I learned to play table tennis when I was I think 13.
*  I went to a Chinese language learning camp in Minnesota.
*  Called Sanlin Hu. And you go there for a month.
*  You can't speak any English I think after the first day.
*  Wow. I had a little bit of Chinese. Not very much.
*  And so that's how you learn the quickest of course is literally immersion.
*  Yeah. So you go there for a month.
*  And no English for a month. And they had there's this older
*  Chinese guy who's like 60 or 70. And I was super into
*  ping pong but I wasn't so good. And basically I played with him
*  every day during the free period for like over an hour.
*  And he beat me probably like 50 times in a row.
*  But by the end of that camp I was beating all the other kids.
*  This guy would beat me like 20 to 3 every single game.
*  But through losing to him I got good enough to beat all the other kids.
*  Yeah you get what's called the rub. Yeah. And I didn't realize I was getting good because I was getting
*  beat 21 to 3 every single time. But you're also absorbing what he's doing.
*  Yes. You're experiencing it. Yeah. You're getting the rub. Yeah.
*  Because in fights when a fighter fights like an elite world champion one of two things
*  will happen. Either they'll realize like oh my god that guy just beat my ass. I'm never going to be as
*  good as that guy. Or the next fight you see a completely overhauled
*  version of who they were. Because they got the rub. They got in there with Israel
*  Adesanya. And they got school. And so they're either going to come back and be better than
*  ever like Robert Whitaker or they're going to fall apart like some guys that he's fought.
*  He breaks guys. Because they realize like I never I can't do
*  what you're doing. The way you're doing it my body doesn't work like that.
*  Israel in his prime was hitting guys with comedy. Watch
*  the Derek Brunson. We'll pull up the Derek Brunson fight.
*  Derek Brunson is a dangerous guy. Knockout striker. Really good wrestler.
*  Very physically strong. Just a dangerous top contender.
*  He's fighting Adesanya. And I believe this is before
*  Adesanya won the title if I'm correct. Not sure. He might have been in
*  defense of the title. Either way. Adesanya who will go down is one of the greatest of all time
*  for sure. He hits him with combinations like
*  he's on a different speed. Like there's
*  a 45 record and a 78. He's doing something different.
*  He's moving in a way that's so precise. And he
*  knows many steps. If I do this you're going to do
*  that. And if I step this way you're going to go that way. And he's got
*  all this programmed in his head. And he's not what he calls smashing buttons.
*  He calls a lot of people they're smashing buttons when they're playing a game. They don't even really
*  exactly know what each button is doing but they're trying to win by smashing buttons.
*  He's like a lot of people fight that way. He goes I fight with precision.
*  He's like a lot of people hit harder than me but I have precision. Watch this
*  KO. This is a beautiful thing to watch if you appreciate
*  combat sports. And if you know how good Derek Brunson is. So Derek
*  Brunson is like very physically strong right here. He's trying to take Adesanya down because
*  Derek is a top tier wrestler. And so
*  they separate them. Something happened. I think Derek was grabbing his shorts or something to get
*  mad at each other. And so this is where Adesanya pieces
*  him up.
*  So he's avoiding the takedowns here. Derek is
*  a real powerhouse as a wrestler. But Adesanya is
*  a striking virtuoso. So then he starts putting it on him.
*  So Derek is just frantically trying to get this fight to the mat
*  every chance he gets.
*  The combinations. Just perfect.
*  Look at this. Watch this.
*  He's just piecing him up. Just connecting.
*  Incredible.
*  So when you're in that space. When you're like
*  in a cage with that guy. One of two things can happen.
*  Either you're going to go, I can't do that. I'm not that good.
*  He just fucked me up. I'm 34 years old.
*  I'm never going to get as good as that guy. Or you become
*  a fucking maniac. And you go to the gym Monday morning.
*  And you're drilling everything. And now you have this new
*  frequency that you've experienced. You've experienced this championship
*  level fighter. And you realize these guys you've been beating, they're good.
*  But this is what it's like to be in there with an all time great.
*  And you either get great yourself. Which many, like I said, Robert Whitaker has done.
*  Or you don't. Or you just kind of decide that you're a journeyman now.
*  You're never going to be a champion.
*  That's sort of what happened with the dream team. Did you see that documentary they did?
*  They did a great, actually the redeem team as it was called. Remember when the
*  US basketball team lost, was it to Spain?
*  And then four years later, obviously, all
*  Americans that care about basketball have an extreme ego that we are the best
*  country for basketball. Which is true. But the rest
*  of the world is catching up. I mean, these European guys were getting better and better.
*  And I think there was American complacency. And the
*  dream team lost, which was a huge blow to
*  everyone who cared about basketball and to the pride of the NBA. And then four
*  years later, you had what they were calling the redeem team.
*  It was LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Kobe Bryant,
*  and so forth. And basically everyone except Kobe got up to training.
*  And they were all kind of, they thought that they were motivated.
*  They thought that they had a chip on their shoulders. They thought, we're in the right
*  head space to redeem the country. And then Kobe got there.
*  And they realized that they were being silly.
*  Like Kobe, they were going to practice, they were doing their thing, and then they were going out clubbing.
*  And then when they were getting home at 3am
*  from clubbing, they would see Kobe getting up to go to the gym.
*  And when they saw that, then they all started doing Kobe's regimen.
*  And they're like, that's a whole different level. And then they
*  won handily. And that's the story. It's a great documentary.
*  It's interesting how the rest of the world starts catching up
*  with certain things. You know, it used to be in
*  boxing that amateur boxing was dominated by Americans.
*  It was for the longest time. And
*  something happened somewhere along the way. First of all,
*  the issue was always communist block countries. Right? Teofilo Stevenson is one of the
*  best examples of that. He was an elite world champion from Cuba.
*  And people had always wanted him to fight Muhammad Ali. Like, oh my god, what would it be like if Teofilo
*  Stevenson fought Muhammad Ali? Because he was beating everybody in boxing
*  as a heavyweight. But he was Cuban, and he was communist, and he fought for the Olympic
*  team, period. And that was it. He never defected. Many boxers did.
*  But he didn't. So they have that advantage. They're being sponsored by the state.
*  They get food and special training and special privileges if they
*  win. And Yoel Romero, who's on the Cuban
*  wrestling team, he explained that all to us here. It was an awesome podcast.
*  And the OED has translated for Yoel. Which is amazing.
*  It was amazing. It was amazing. But the way he was saying the programs that they have,
*  like the insane dedication they have. And then if you are
*  of the elite, you get three meals a day. But if you're below that, you get two meals a day.
*  And so you have this insane motivation
*  that these young guys have. It's not just, I want to be great. It's like, I want more food.
*  Yeah. Crazy. He's like, and you become
*  a machine. So he described it. And to have this guy
*  who's like a hulk of a man. He's so massive. And he fights
*  at 185 pounds, or at least he used to. I have no idea how he got to 185 pounds.
*  I was always baffled by his weight cut. Because he's enormous.
*  You know? I mean, he's this like
*  just specimen of a man. And so when he says, and you become
*  a machine. And you look at him, you're like, he's a fucking machine.
*  I mean, that, so there was that in the
*  Soviet block countries. But somewhere along the line,
*  the Americans lost a lot of the dominance. And now there's these
*  Eastern European fighters. And there's Russian fighters that are
*  super elite. Like, very, very high level. And then they come over
*  to professional boxing. And there's quite a few of them
*  from some of those warred toward countries like Chechnya. Like, one of the scariest
*  guys in the world right now is this guy, Arthur Bitterbeve. And he's the
*  light heavyweight champion. And nobody wants to fight him. He's 19 and
*  0 with 19 knockouts. No one survives.
*  And he's got this seek and destroy style
*  that's absolutely terrifying. He just comes at guys and never
*  backs up. And he looks like a fucking terrifying human.
*  He's built like a tank with that beard, you know, the lower beard that Muslims
*  have. You know, he's just a monster, man. Just a monster. What's the latest
*  with the Mike Tyson, Logan, Logan, was it Logan Paul or Jake?
*  Jake's the really good boxer. Tell me about that. Because I saw that reported
*  and I got super interested in it. But I haven't looked into it since. I am fascinating
*  because it's going to happen. There's nothing I can do to stop it from happening. Do you
*  want to stop it from happening? I do not necessarily think it's a good idea for 57
*  year old men to be fighting 27 year old men.
*  I think with the skill, like if a 27
*  year old me fought a 57 year old Mike Tyson, yeah, he'd beat the fucking
*  shit out of me. It would be quick. But a 27 year old
*  Jake Paul who can box and is very good power and he's
*  very fast and he's young. He's going to be smaller than Mike. Mike
*  will probably weigh 230 pounds-ish. And Jake
*  will probably weigh 200 pounds-ish. He's fought, you know,
*  I think he got as low as like 187 or 185 for some of his fights. He's a
*  big guy though. And he probably cuts weight to get there and he won't cut weight for this at all.
*  So maybe he will be similar in weight. Maybe he won't want to be because he will
*  want the speed. But he can knock people dead. He's a
*  really good puncher. And he's a good boxer. Like he's fought very good
*  boxers and he's knocked out a lot of former MMA stars.
*  Including Tyron Woodley. He was one of the greatest welterweights
*  of all time and he flatlined him. He's really good. So what is Mike
*  Tyson's incentive to do this? It's a lot of money I'm sure.
*  I'm sure they came to him with a lot of money. You know people don't think Jake Paul's really good.
*  Those people are all people that can't get by
*  the fact that he's a YouTube guy. Like I had this argument with Dave Portnoy
*  where he was trying to tell me he sucks, you know, and Tommy Fury sucks. I mean he does not suck.
*  Don't say he sucks. You don't know what you're talking about. You might not like him but you should separate that from-
*  You can't say- specifically Tommy Fury. He's like he fights bombs, he's fighting
*  his Tommy Fury guy. I go you're incorrect. As a person who understands combat
*  sports, this guy's very skilled. He's very skilled. He's a very elite boxer.
*  Like I'm watching the combinations he throws, his movement, the way he steps and
*  sets up shots, the way he's countering. He's a very high level boxer.
*  He's a real professional caliber boxer. And Jake
*  Paul, that was his first loss. But it was a close loss. Jake Paul's a
*  really good boxer and he knocks a lot of people unconscious. And if he wasn't
*  Jake Paul the YouTube guy, just this wild kid coming up in the
*  middleweight ranks or the light heavyweight ranks or whatever cruiserweight I guess he's in,
*  you would go holy shit look at this guy. This guy's fun. He's
*  wild. He wears all those flashy jewelry. He's got crazy tattoos everywhere and he knocks
*  people unconscious. And he's knocked a bunch of former MMA champions unconscious.
*  Wow. Knock Ben Askren unconscious which is, you know, Ben Askren was not really a striker but
*  the point is like Nate Simmons, that basketball player, did you see that fight?
*  No. Oh my god dude. This is when I was telling people, I'm like, hey man,
*  he can fight fight. Like really fight. I know Nate is a
*  basketball player and he's like really athletic and probably out of his
*  element in a boxing match but he took it because he really believes in himself.
*  But Jake Paul is actually a better boxer. But watch what he does.
*  The way he does it. The way he lands these shots. These are real punches.
*  That like elite caliber of technique.
*  Like he's got the thing. He's got, first of all, he's got one punch
*  knockout power which is odd. It's an odd thing to have.
*  Not everybody gets it. So you could go, like some of the greats like Julio Cesar Chavez,
*  one of the greatest of all time, did not have one punch knockout power, would beat
*  you down slowly but surely with a barrage of punches, just
*  constantly moving, perfectly placed combinations but he would wear your ass down
*  over three, four, five rounds and eventually you just crumble over the weight of the
*  blows. You can't hit him. He's destroying you. Mike Tyson is a one punch killer.
*  Deontay Wilde is the greatest one puncher of all time. Do you think Tyson is such a
*  genetic freak that his 57 may not have declined from
*  his prime as much as a normal person? Yes and science.
*  So here's the difference. A 57 year old today is on testosterone
*  replacement therapy. That's the other thing I was going to ask. It's not 57 in the Jack Johnson days.
*  We're talking about 57 in the days of biological engineering.
*  You're able to do all kinds of stuff with his human growth hormone levels, with the use of peptides,
*  with the use of testosterone. The difference between
*  a young man and an old man, there's a bunch of them, right? But a lot of it is
*  hormonal. A lot of it is like how much you've been using the body.
*  There's older people that are in incredible shape that
*  don't do anything as far as hormone replacement. They have just
*  never stayed off the grind and they're diligent with their nutrition
*  and their supplementation and they sleep well and they drink a lot of water
*  and they're in incredible shape deep into their 50s. Those are rare.
*  Those are the outliers, right? But a 57 year
*  old today that's on hormone replacement and you're
*  eating well and taking a lot of vitamins and creatine and
*  you're using all these strategies like red light therapy
*  and saunas and cold punch. That's a different thing,
*  man. And Mike Tyson's that different thing. Like he
*  could fuck him up. It could be one of those fights where Mike Tyson
*  gets him in a corner and connects with a punch and Jake Paul just goes limp.
*  He's still that guy. If you watch him hit mitts,
*  the thing is can he close the gap? Can he move?
*  As a quickness point. He has problems with his back. He's had sciatic problems.
*  The point where a year or so ago he was walking with a cane.
*  Now what sciatica is is your nerves
*  are getting pushed. So something's pushing on your nerves. It could be a bulging disc.
*  It could be a bunch of different things. But that's an issue. It's a real issue
*  that can become chronic especially when you're going through a long and intensive training camp
*  like he's going through now up to July 20th.
*  But when I look at him hit the pads and he's hitting pads with this
*  guy, Rafael Cordero, who's a legendary MMA trainer.
*  He comes from Chute de Boxe in Brazil. Curitiba, Brazil created
*  one of the wildest, most aggressive mixed martial arts fighters ever.
*  Anderson Silva, Vanderlei Silva,
*  Murillo Shogun. All these guys who came out of there were
*  monsters. And Rafael Cordero is from that camp. He was an elite
*  Thai boxer and then he became an elite MMA trainer. And so he's the guy
*  working with Mike Tyson. And so he's holding myths with Mike Tyson. And Mike Tyson is
*  smashing those myths. That's what I saw in that video. So this is like right now
*  57 year old. See if you can find some of that. Not the older stuff but the newer stuff.
*  Because it's on his Instagram. Looked pretty serious.
*  Yeah. He's like day two still want to fuck with me?
*  I'm 100% rooting for Mike Tyson. Oh of course. Obviously. Of course. Everybody
*  should be. And you know Jake Paul is probably
*  a little scared. You know as much as he thinks he's the younger guy and he's a
*  tough guy and he's a really good boxer and he'll probably be able to do it. Look at this.
*  Give me some volume. Terrifying.
*  That's still Mike Tyson.
*  Yeah that's still what I see in my nightmares. That is a guy who's on testosterone.
*  That's a guy who's on human growth hormone. Gotta be right? Gotta be.
*  I mean I never asked him but I couldn't imagine he would try to do this without
*  and I couldn't imagine he would be able to keep that physique. Like he got heavy
*  for a while. This was updated today on USA Today.
*  Fight must still be approved. Oh interesting. It's only been announced on the
*  calendar for the AT&T stadium. Interesting.
*  They have not been approved by the Texas board yet. Interesting.
*  Well there's probably going to be a lot of pressure for them to not approve it. Just based on his age.
*  The age gap is 30 years which is just wild.
*  But there is a difference between Mike Tyson and a regular person.
*  I listened to your podcast with Kurt Metzger
*  who I know and I've been on his podcast. Had a great time on his podcast. He's a fun dude.
*  He is. But I think I disagree with you both on the Israel
*  issue on the idea. There was one point where
*  you were kind of saying it's almost as if the Jews are doing what was done to them.
*  As if it's genocide. I'm saying that when you're killing
*  30,000 innocent civilians in response to something that killed
*  1,200 innocent civilians and you're continuing to bomb an area into oblivion
*  which is what it looks like when you're looking at Gaza.
*  There's many people that have made the argument that that is at least the steps
*  of genocide or a form of genocide. You're destroying
*  thousands and thousands of people's homes and killing them.
*  So when you say 30,000 civilians, it's not 30,000
*  civilians that have been killed though. How many thousands have been killed? So according to
*  Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas,
*  the number they have is 32,000 but they don't distinguish between Hamas
*  and civilians. How many members of Hamas are there?
*  40,000, something like that. I don't think the number is known but it's
*  tens of thousands. So Hamas says 32,000 people have been
*  killed, civilians and soldiers. Israel says 13,000
*  soldiers have been killed by Israel. So if you just
*  being, let's not doubt either number, they could both be
*  inflated but if both of those numbers are accurate
*  which they may or may not be, that would be 13,000 soldiers killed,
*  19,000 civilians killed, which for urban combat in the
*  Middle East is a very normal ratio.
*  I see what you're saying if you wanted to look at it cold and objectively.
*  I hope it doesn't come across cold because
*  But it's mostly women and children that are dying
*  because they're in a place where these terrorists are.
*  Because the terrorists on purpose embed themselves
*  with the civilian population, which is a war crime. Which is a strategy that they
*  have clearly employed when you see them. When the IDF went into that
*  hospital and found Hamas. Just recently? Yes.
*  So it's real. It's not just a conspiracy theory. We know that that's real.
*  But it's still, you're still talking about 20,000
*  whatever it is of innocent people getting bombed into the
*  Stone Age. And then there's this like
*  what are the pressures that are being put on people
*  that are trying to deliver aid? How difficult
*  is it? So my understanding of the aid issue
*  and I've looked into it quite a bit, is that the
*  aid is getting into Gaza. They've gotten
*  over a quarter ton of food into Gaza since the beginning of the war
*  which is pretty similar to the food that was getting in. The problem is it's not getting to the
*  people. Especially in the north because the north is a war zone.
*  So it's getting through the border. Israel's allowing it in.
*  But then what happens is the IDF doesn't control the delivery.
*  The delivery is controlled by humanitarian organizations like
*  UNRWA and just other, a whole bevy of humanitarian organizations.
*  And they have these aid convoys going to people but then Hamas hijacks it.
*  Random gang of people. Palestinians
*  hijack it. Hungry civilians hijack it. And
*  it's an absolute mess in terms of distributing the aid. And that's why you see
*  it. And it was a problem in the war in Iraq too. What was the case
*  when it was being reported? It's very difficult to know when you're getting the Hamas
*  version of a story and then you're getting the Israeli version of a story. What
*  happened when there was the aid truck and people started getting
*  shot? The one last night? No, it was a while ago. Ah, okay. So yes.
*  Do you remember that one? That was a couple weeks ago. That I don't have the full
*  detailed version up to date of what happened there. But I
*  believe it was, it had something to do with a clash between the
*  IDF and other Palestinians that were involved
*  in distributing the aid. Because what you have is you have Hamas
*  but you also have powerful families in
*  Gaza that you could call them sort of criminal syndicates or whatever. But they're
*  powerful important families as well that are also
*  taking the aid sometime. And these are the families that if
*  Israel is allowed and goes into Rafa and defeats Hamas
*  one of the possibilities is that they want to get these powerful Palestinian
*  families to take over the Gaza Strip. And these people are also involved
*  in the distribution of aid or in the hoarding of aid
*  or in the stealing of aid or in the taking of aid and then selling it for very
*  high prices on the secondary market which is why it may not be getting to everyone in the
*  north. So it's not because... So are those the people that the Israeli soldiers shot?
*  No, I think it turned into, it could have been a panic
*  firefight and they killed civilians.
*  What caused the panic firefight? I don't think there's details. That I don't
*  know. So the accusation was that they were shooting people that were trying to get
*  aid? Yes. And you don't think that's the case?
*  I think it's very unlikely. Is it possible? Yeah, it's possible. Absolutely.
*  My assumption is that there is going to be war crimes in this war.
*  Because, and I know Kurt would probably say,
*  I'm doing the tragedy of war thing, but it's actually a legitimate point
*  in every single war, even the just ones. There are war crimes
*  by berserk soldiers, by the good guys. That doesn't mean it's genocide.
*  And that doesn't mean it's not a just war. That is a very important
*  point, the war crimes thing. Because I think when you're asking
*  someone to follow and obey rules,
*  when you're also asking them to murder people, that they don't even know.
*  And that these are the bad people. You have it in your head that
*  those are the people that you have to kill. And you're getting shot at and you're watching your friends
*  die and you're two years into this now.
*  Whatever it is. When you're in Ukraine, for instance,
*  you're two years into getting shot at. And I'm sure they do some
*  horrific shit if they catch people. Or if they get someone that they think is
*  on the other side. Or someone who looks like they're on the other side.
*  You're asking a person to do an insanely
*  evil and horrific thing, but then stop when the rules don't apply.
*  And some people are not going to do that. That's right. And I think the fundamental
*  difference between Israel and Hamas is Israeli society,
*  however imperfectly, is not going to celebrate
*  the monsters on their own side when they're really found to be monsters.
*  They're not going to hand out candies to people who kill
*  Palestinian civilians like Hamas does.
*  In reverse. And so my feeling about it is still that
*  any nation that suffered
*  what Israel did on October 7th, everyone in the country would be saying
*  you have to go get these guys. You have to eliminate this organization that did
*  this. And if they're 80% finished with that
*  job, it would make no sense at this point to stop before you've cut out the last
*  20% of the cancer or before you've put out the last 20% of the fire.
*  Even with all of the absolute suffering that is real on the Palestinian
*  side. So that's how I feel about it. And I think it's
*  really, it's very, very distinct from genocide.
*  Because genocide is when you're trying to maximize civilian casualties.
*  I think Israel, however imperfectly, is doing the opposite. They're trying to
*  maximize civilian casualties. That's interesting.
*  What would people say that would disagree
*  with you when they talk about targeting mosques, targeting hospitals?
*  We know that some of the targeting hospital stories are just not true. Like the New York
*  Times printed a story saying that the hospital was bombed and that
*  X amount of people died. And it turns out the bomb actually hit the parking lot of the hospital.
*  And a very small amount of people died. We talked about that last time. Yeah. So there is
*  some, there's, but there have been for sure targeting
*  of mosques. Like for instance. Do you think that's because Hamas uses
*  these mosques? Absolutely. So when they're blowing up their
*  infrastructure and bombing the mosques and bombing whatever the schools,
*  they're doing it because Hamas is in those schools. They're doing it because they
*  have good faith intelligence that Hamas is in those schools. And they tell
*  them, these people are using human shields and they just
*  they'd say, well, the most important thing is getting rid of Hamas.
*  Yeah. The laws of war say you cannot target a church, a mosque, a hospital.
*  But if the enemy turns that hospital into a military
*  operation site as Hamas does, which is routine for them,
*  then it can
*  become legitimate. You have to do a proportionality assessment. Is it worth
*  killing this many civilians to get the bad guys? And that's a judgment
*  call that I think reasonable people can disagree on on a case by case basis.
*  And I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I would disagree with that. I would agree with every
*  bombing that that that Israel has made. I might think I'm
*  certain there's one that that was not worth it. You kill too many people for
*  but but that's a judgment call that armies are allowed
*  to make in times of war. And Hamas is the one that turns these civilian locations
*  into military operation sites, which is a war
*  crime. It's it's like this is the way I would put it succinctly.
*  If you ask the question, what is unique about this war?
*  What is different about this war than all other other wars? It's not the
*  civilian death toll. The ratio of combatants to
*  civilians is I think it's better than the American armies was when we got ISIS
*  out of Mosul. That was like ten thousand civilians dead to kill four thousand ISIS.
*  This is nineteen thousand civilians dead to kill thirteen thousand.
*  It's not it's it's not that.
*  You know, the what's what's unique about this war,
*  unlike every other war that I could think of, is is
*  you have an army in Hamas that has
*  perfected the art of embedding itself in meshing itself with civilians so that you cannot
*  hit them without hitting the people around them. Other armies have done this, but none have
*  perfected it to the extent that Hamas has. No army that I know of
*  in military history has had fifteen years to build
*  three hundred miles of tunnel underneath a city that they don't use to shelter the civilians, but
*  they used to shelter themselves so that they can operate right under a kindergarten,
*  right under a mosque. So this is a challenge no army has faced.
*  And so that that's what makes this war different. And yes, the I agree with
*  all of the the absolute tragedy and suffering of the Palestinian people, but it's what what creates
*  that is the way Hamas fights. And either we can say one of two things.
*  We can either say, well, Israel just Israel doesn't have a clean shot.
*  And so they have to let Hamas get away with it because it's too much to bear.
*  But then we are essentially creating a situation where terrorists are being
*  created. We are essentially creating a situation where terrorists have found the perfect solution,
*  which is that you can cross the border, go house to house slaughtering your enemies,
*  and then hide behind your own people and they can do nothing about it.
*  It's a perfect strategy. Can we live in a world where we allow that to be an acceptable strategy?
*  I don't think so. And it's very it's very ugly to watch.
*  It's heartbreaking. And I completely understand why people don't think the way I think when they see the videos.
*  I completely get it. But I don't think we can actually live in a world where that's allowed to be a strategy.
*  I appreciate your perspective. Yeah, I see what you're saying.
*  Yeah, you clearly know more about it than I do. But also
*  one of the fears is that people wanted the people in power in Israel wanted Hamas to be in power in Gaza
*  because they wanted an enemy that they could fight with impunity, that they could attack,
*  almost like they could justify what they really want to do, which is take over Gaza.
*  This is the fear that a lot of the people that delve hardcore into conspiracy theories about.
*  There's people that I've heard call it a false flag.
*  There's two different things. One is that they wanted Hamas to stay in control of Gaza.
*  And one is that because they can justify because they justify attacks and that they would always have someone to attack.
*  They would always have some reason to push forward.
*  I think I think it's weird. The things I've heard are two kind of conflicting theories.
*  One was that Netanyahu wanted to keep Hamas in power. Right.
*  And was essentially paying them off. That's right. He was funding.
*  Yeah. But you know, the whole world was funding Gaza, you know, the EU and America too, because we don't want people to starve.
*  But the idea was we're going to keep Hamas in place because Hamas is so scary and terrible and everyone recognizes they're a terrorist organization.
*  And they don't. Unless you're on a college campus. Right. Right. Right.
*  And Hamas doesn't even pretend to want the two state solution.
*  Whereas Palestinian authority is more moderate. They have become close or seemingly come close.
*  So if you're an Israeli prime minister against the two state solution, the way that people have argued is that Netanyahu wants to keep the Palestinians divided.
*  Palestinian authority Hamas here this way. He'll never be pressured to do a two state solution because Hamas doesn't even want it.
*  Right. So that's the idea is that Netanyahu wants to keep Hamas in power.
*  And that was based on comments, comments that he made at a meeting, although there was never a video of the meeting.
*  But it seems like something he might say. So that was one theory.
*  But then the other theory, which kind of conflicts with that, they can't really both be true, I think, is that Netanyahu wanted the attack to happen as a pretext to take over Gaza, which I think makes makes no sense.
*  I mean, the first the first theory is not crazy. It's not at all crazy that Netanyahu wanted to keep Hamas in power.
*  So that because imagine if Palestinian authority and Palestinian authority are here, they could link up and say we want a state.
*  And then Netanyahu would have to be the guy saying no two state solution. Right.
*  But if they're divided, he never has to deal with that.
*  What does it make sense at all is that he somehow false flagged the October 7th so that he could take over over Gaza for two reasons.
*  One, nobody has wanted to take over Gaza, not even Egypt.
*  Nobody wants to run it. There's no strategic advantage for Israel to run it.
*  Well, Israel occupies it. So if it's no longer Gaza, if it's part of Israel, like Israel expanded its boundaries throughout its history. Right.
*  Sure. But no, nobody has actually won the Gaza Strip.
*  And Israel is very focused on the West Bank.
*  West Bank has religious significance to religious significance to Jews.
*  They call it Judea and Samaria. It's where so many of the things in the Bible happened.
*  So the Jews have an attachment to the West Bank. Many do.
*  Even some secular Jews. Jews have no attachment to the Gaza Strip whatsoever.
*  It's again, Egypt didn't even want it.
*  Egypt occupied it for 20 years in the middle of the 20th century.
*  And they didn't even want it back after their war with Israel because it has no strategic value.
*  And it was it was more of a headache to manage than it was worth.
*  Secondly, October 7th is basically the worst thing for Netanyahu's legacy ever.
*  Everyone in Israel, his popularity has only declined because of this event, because he seemed to have let it happen.
*  And the second the war is over, he's he's basically going to be run out in shame.
*  So why would they protest?
*  Well, weren't they protesting him before? Yes.
*  For months on the streets, thousands of people. Yes.
*  And it was because he was trying to expand the powers of the court.
*  He was trying to diminish the power of the court.
*  That's right. Yeah, because the court in Israel kind of has power to check the right wing government.
*  It's almost the reverse of America.
*  How we have a conservative court, they kind of have a long story short, they kind of a liberal court that can check the power of the right wing party that Netanyahu runs.
*  And so there are a lot of people disagreed about that.
*  It's a whole long issue, but the left wing in Israel was very upset that he was trying to diminish the power of the court.
*  So if the left wing in Israel, if he's trying to diminish the power of the court so that he could get right wing agendas pushed forth, if again, I want to be really clear.
*  I'm not saying this is a false flag, but that would be if I was a guy that was inclined to do a false flag, I would justify my need to do whatever I needed to do to combat these people that were willing to do this thing.
*  Now, I'm not saying not even a false flag, but allowing something to happen or having knowledge.
*  I'm not attached to this at all. I don't even agree with it myself.
*  I'm just saying that this is like a concept that people throw around.
*  So in counter to that concept, I would argue Netanyahu was elected just before this whole judicial forum thing happened.
*  The fact that the left was protesting, it doesn't mean that Netanyahu was in kind of an existential situation.
*  His base loved him. If anything, the protests fired up his base even more.
*  So it was kind of like the women's march after Trump won.
*  Yeah, exactly. No, it was bigger than I want to give it credit. It was bigger than that.
*  It was dividing Israeli society more than that.
*  But Netanyahu didn't even from that situation, however precarious it was, his situation immediately got worse after October 7th because everyone blamed him.
*  And it's only gotten worse in the past few months.
*  If you look at the polling on approval of Netanyahu, if it was a false flag, it would be the dumbest false flag in the world.
*  And he's not a dumb guy. So there's no chance it's a false flag.
*  So the other conspiracy theory would be that they had foreknowledge of it, but they allowed it to happen.
*  This is one that gets attached to 9-11 as well, right?
*  Yes, it gets attached to everything.
*  Of course.
*  But I mean, my thing with that is if you're in a country like Israel, if you're the Mossad or the Shin Bet, you have Hamas, you have Hamas in Gaza, Hamas in the West Bank, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, Iran, Houthis, and so on.
*  And you're basically getting every single day, you're getting a list of 14, 15 different threats and plans on Israel.
*  Right? Some of them small, some of them huge.
*  How do you distinguish between the ones that are likely to happen and the ones are not?
*  This is a very difficult thing. It's not obvious, right?
*  You use your intelligence, you try to have spies in all the Palestinian areas that are informing and so forth.
*  But you're constantly getting signals of threats all the time.
*  Right. So to say they knew about it is not the same as they might have gotten information about.
*  They did get information about a plan to attack at some point.
*  They didn't know it was going to happen on October 7th.
*  They didn't know the scale of it or how successful it was going to be.
*  How was it so successful if they have the most sophisticated surveillance system?
*  How was it so successful?
*  How were they able to pull that off?
*  So it was partly because normally Israel would have lots of lots of ideas stationed on the border with Gaza because there's a wall there.
*  But they would normally have lots of they had very few soldiers there because they were distracted.
*  The whole country divided over these protests.
*  The soldiers were in the West Bank.
*  And this is one of the reasons why people blame Netanyahu because it was under his watch that they took their eye off Hamas.
*  Now this is where it goes to the first theory that Netanyahu wanted to keep Hamas in power.
*  One of the reasons why he thought he benefited and he I guess he did benefit from Hamas staying in power is that they believed Hamas was deterred.
*  In other words, they believed mistakenly, partly because Hamas was sending these signals for years that Hamas doesn't want to fight us right now.
*  Right now they're focused on taking all our money and taking the world's money and building stuff in Gaza.
*  Hamas was very smart.
*  They allowed Israel to believe that while they planned this whole thing.
*  So they got complacent essentially.
*  And this happens with this happens with groups all the time.
*  I mean, like they fought with Hezbollah in 2006.
*  But the assumption has been that Hezbollah hasn't really made a major plans to attack full scale, even though their army is way stronger than Hamas.
*  I mean, Hezbollah has an incredibly strong army.
*  But Israelis assume that because we bombed them so bad in 2006 and they told us if we knew the leader of Hezbollah said this,
*  if they knew how badly you were going to come after us because of our raid in 2006, we never would have done it.
*  Signaling that essentially Hezbollah is not going to do anything, even though they hate Israel, even though they the whole their whole organization started to fight Israel.
*  They're not going to do anything right now.
*  And this is when when you have a country with that many security threats on all sides,
*  they sometimes rely on this notion that these people are deterred because they know what will happen to them if they attack.
*  And so they won't. And and that's what they thought was true of Hamas.
*  And that's why they were giving Hamas money and increasing the amount of Palestinians that could come to Gaza and so forth.
*  So it was all a tragic miscalculation, but it was not a false flag.
*  So the. What do you think they thought would happen if you go across the border and you kill 1200 innocent civilians?
*  No way they thought they'd be that successful. Really? There's no way.
*  How could they have thought they would be that successful? To have the run of the place for hours, going house to house, kibbutz to kibbutz, barely encountering any resistance for the first couple of hours.
*  There's no way that they thought they would be that successful, I think.
*  And how are the people there not armed? They are armed.
*  Israelis are Israelis are all the people in the settlements.
*  So the problem is that the kibbutz is that are right next to Gaza.
*  Those are all the hippies. That's where all the I've been.
*  I've been to those villages. That's where all the which is why the raves were there.
*  That's right. And these are all the super left wing Israeli hippies, communists that literally they live in communes.
*  A kibbutz is a commune. They're very little idea like beautiful villages and they're the most left wing part of Israeli society.
*  They they they have a lot of love for the Palestinians.
*  They're the people that go over into Gaza and when someone needs hospital, they'll drive them from Gaza to Israel.
*  So they were not the hardliners there and probably the ones.
*  I don't know how armed they would be in that kind of a town.
*  I don't that I don't know. It's pretty crazy to be right next door to people that hate you and not have guns.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That I don't know. Maybe they are armed.
*  But they're these are people who are like, you know, they're living in communes.
*  What did they think the response was going to be?
*  I mean, the response they had to think that Israel would do something comparable to what they're doing or the possibility of them doing something comparable to what they're doing was always there that they would just go all out.
*  Yes. But I think that from Hamas's point of view, Hamas could never hold a candle to the IDF.
*  We all know that there's a huge power imbalance.
*  They have no chance of beating the IDF militarily.
*  So you have to ask, what is their goal?
*  Well, their goal is that in the long run, the world will turn against Israel so deeply and sympathize with their cause so much that Hezbollah,
*  Iran and all kinds of forces will get involved on their side and America, the great Satan will abandon Israel.
*  And in that case, they have a very good chance of beating Israel.
*  If Hezbollah, Iran team up and America is not there, they're thinking about 50, 100 years.
*  They will free their land from the Jews that they that they hate.
*  And so viewed from that perspective, Israel launching a big attack to get rid of them, killing a lot of civilians because they use the human shield method is a winning strategy potentially.
*  Because look how much look how much sympathy from the PR war they have gotten as a result of this almost instantaneously.
*  OK, so they're not fighting a military war. They know they have no chance. They're not idiots.
*  They're fighting a PR war, whereas Israel is fighting a military war.
*  And they're both actually winning at those respective wars that they are fighting.
*  Interesting. Have you had a debate with anybody about this?
*  Yeah, I had I had this guy, Yousef Muneer, who's a very Palestinian activist with very strong pro-Palestine feelings on my podcast about this.
*  People can go check that out.
*  He's the only one that I've had on the other side of this topic.
*  And then besides that, I had Benny Morris, who was in the Lex Friedman debate.
*  Oh, right, right. I've had I've also had correspondence on email with Norman Finkelstein.
*  But how was that? Did he yell at you? Yeah, he did. All caps.
*  Yeah, he called me a black Shabbos goy. What does that mean? I didn't even know what that meant.
*  Did you have to look it up? Yeah, well, it's it's I think on on on the Sabbath,
*  there are some people that will come in and do the lights for them because they can't touch electricity.
*  And they call that a Shabbos goy because a goy is like a non-Jew, I guess.
*  So but it's the goy that helps you on the Sabbath.
*  And so Finkelstein called me a black Shabbos goy, implying that I'm kind of doing the dirty work of the Jews as a non-Jew,
*  which is which is kind of weird to go to a character attack like that.
*  And it's not what he usually does. What an esoteric character.
*  Yeah, I was like, I have to look this one up. Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah, that's a guy who's playing Dennis Miller on you.
*  Well, what does that mean? Using references that he like, oh, yeah, yeah.
*  What the fuck is he talking about? Yeah, you got to look it up.
*  Dennis Miller should do that. Like it was part of a stand up routine. Right.
*  He would use references that like the average person is no idea.
*  He might not even. Norm MacDonald always famously said, you know, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
*  Why does he do that? Crowd likes that.
*  I was part of his shtick of being the smartest guy in the room. Oh, I hate that.
*  Yeah, that was well, he was a good comic. Dennis Miller was a very, very good comic.
*  But part of it, like if you go watch like his HBO special, it's excellent.
*  It's a very good comic. But that was part of his thing.
*  It's like he was a shmormy guy that was part of his thing.
*  And then he turned into a right wing guy right after 9-11. 9-11. OK.
*  Snapped him over. I've never seen this guy.
*  Dennis Miller? No. Really? No.
*  Is he still is he still around? I don't know what he does now.
*  He was doing like right wing radio for a long time and he became it was like amongst comedians.
*  It was famous that he like wouldn't make fun of George Bush because he was friends with them.
*  So he gives them a pass. There was so much material there.
*  There was so much material. It was so fun.
*  But he wouldn't, you know, smoke them out of their holes. Yeah.
*  He was an odd duck, you know. And I go to the cellar all the time.
*  I see the up and coming comics. It's so much fun. Yeah.
*  Yeah. There's so many great ones. Well, New York has got a nice crop always of great comics.
*  I always try to go when a tell is there because he's. Oh my God, dude. He was in town.
*  He was in town at my club and it's like, God, I was like watching like a Hendrix.
*  Like watching a master. It's so crazy to watch. Yeah. So good, man. It's just so fun.
*  The way that his mind works is a complete enigma to me. The associations he makes.
*  So there's like there are type of jokes where if somebody doesn't get the joke, I could explain it to them in two sentences.
*  Right. A lot of a tell jokes. I don't even know how to explain that, but it's perfect.
*  Yeah, it's his style. Yeah. And he also has a cadence. It's very intoxicating.
*  That's right. That's right. Yeah. And he's just got this confidence of 35 years of stand up and at the highest level and constantly working.
*  Constantly touring, constantly going up, constantly going doing weekends places. Yeah. He's a monster.
*  Absolute monster. It's such a joy to see. It's such so great to see someone is like at the top of their game.
*  And you get the rub. You get the rub being in the room. Like, God damn, I want to go right. I want to get better.
*  I'm sure. Yeah. He's he's the man. Yeah. And there's quite a few guys like that right now.
*  It's like this is a real golden era for stand up comic comedy. There's so many great comics alive right now. Yeah.
*  They're touring. It's like fucking 20 guys that sell out arenas. That's never happened before. Ever. Really? Not in the history of comedy.
*  So why is that a golden age? I think the Internet for sure. The Internet because people who maybe HBO wouldn't give them a special or Comedy Central would give them a special.
*  Now they just put it out on YouTube. Yeah. And then they get six million views and it was like, oh my God. Then they're selling out everywhere. That's amazing. Yeah, it's incredible.
*  How it's like just gotten rid of the barriers between the artist and the people. Yeah. Completely gotten rid of the barriers. No more gatekeepers.
*  It's a podcast or the only gatekeepers and everybody has a podcast and everybody goes on everybody else's podcast.
*  So it's it's just like a natural network, like an organic network instead of like a television network. Yeah. It's a network of friends.
*  Are you on like TikTok or Instagram reels at all? I don't put my stuff on Instagram reels.
*  I guess maybe I make a reel every now and then, but I don't like. I mean, do you consume it though? Yes. You do consume it. I mean, so I don't do TikTok, but I do Instagram reels sometimes.
*  Unfortunately, I'm in an algorithm where I'm seeing car accidents. Oh, no. Yeah, I'm seeing car accidents, animal attacks. Like the Russian car accidents. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's crazy.
*  Yeah. A gas truck's falling down on people. Yeah. You murders. You can see everything. You can see everything on Instagram now.
*  And it's like it gives you the blurry thing. It says, you know, sensitive content. Yeah. Do you want to click it? Are you sure? Of course. I'm sure.
*  It's fucking sensitive. And so you're watching some guy, you know, stick some guy up in a liquor store and the other guy shoots him in the head.
*  And you're like, Jesus Christ. Yeah, there's so much of it. There's so much. And I don't understand how that doesn't violate their terms of service.
*  Like, I don't understand how it gets recommended to me in the algorithm. I've seen TikTok live streams of people that look like they're in third world countries with like like a mother and her son that you would see in a commercial asking you to donate.
*  And they're just sitting there on a tick tick tick tock live stream asking for donations. Yeah, you can do that. And it could almost it looks like it could be a human trafficking scenario. Like it's. Yeah. And then right back to your silly videos.
*  It's absolutely jarring. Yeah, absolutely jarring. And, you know, you could anybody could make a tick tock account. Yeah. But that's the other part about it is that you I've seen so many entertainers on tick tock and Instagram reels that are just brilliant in what they do.
*  Maybe they do little sketches or whatever it is that they do that without tick tock. They never would have. They would have just been a funny guy to their friends. Right. You know. Right. Right. Yeah. Well, it's a strategy for a career now. Yeah. You can really become a very famous tick tock person and make millions of dollars a year.
*  Or you can just work in an office and fucking hate your life. Right. You know, there's a lot of kids today that have zero desire to do anything other than being an influencer. That's right. It's a huge goal. Jonathan. He talked about it. There's like somewhere like 50 percent of the kids they asked. They just want to be famous.
*  Which is wild. When I was a kid, nobody wanted to be famous. Like, no. What's your goal, Johnny? Nobody's like, I want to be famous. Like, maybe there's just one guy. I want to be a rock star. Wow. Yeah. Johnny wants me a rock star. That's crazy. Everybody else is trying to get a job. Now kids realize that like young, outrageous people who are fun to watch can make millions of dollars just making silly content videos. Or you could be a guy like Mr. Beast to create your own empire. What some young people are doing?
*  This is a young 20s. Why would you not want to do that? Why would you not want to do that? That seems like way better than working for some company that could just fire you with the drop of the hat when a robot can replace you. Which is what's going to happen to a lot of people in the near future. I think we're going to have there's going to be a mass loss of jobs like nothing we've ever experienced before in history. That's what Andrew Yang was all about. He was way ahead of the curve. He was mostly talking about automation. Like you know, but
*  driverless cars and the like. And he's right about that for sure. But the AI thing is bigger than that because the AI thing is it consume creative endeavors. It can take over the job of writing for like law and order. One of those kind of shows. It's like the good guy has to win. And you got to catch the bad guy. What did he do wrong? Like, here's some scenarios and it could just write scripts for you. Yeah, you can. You probably don't need a writer anymore. And then with Sora. But honestly, do you think it will ever write jokes?
*  Yes. But as good as it won't be able to perform them like David Tell because I can't perform David Tell's jokes. Right. Yeah. You have to be David Tell to perform those jokes. Right. It's like there's a is the style that he has that is uniquely his. Like Mitch Hedberg had that Theo Vaughn has that. There's some Theo Vaughn's a great example. There's things that Theo Vaughn says. Everything he says is funny. So if I said it, I would just seem like an insane person. Exactly. Exactly. With him, I can't stop laughing. Yeah. There's people.
*  That Sebastian Manasalco, he's developed a style. There's like a style that people. He's so physical with his body. Yeah. But there's also like a style of his outrage. It's just it just he's figured it out. And I watched Sebastian figure it out when I first met him. He was really just starting out and he was nothing nearly as good as he is now. You know, so will they be able to create one of those? Probably not. No, maybe. I don't know. I mean, I'm not entirely sure that our brain is so sophisticated.
*  It can't be replicated. I would agree. I think that's really egocentric for us to believe. I think there's there's been so much denial of how amazing chat GPT is. Right from the start, you had people saying, oh, this is nothing.
*  Pretending that this thing that can pass the LSAT, get a perfect score in the SAT is not impressive. Yeah. Because snooze is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know where that came from, but I'm incredibly impressed by GPT and all the derivatives.
*  I just I do wonder if it, you know, like if everyone starts writing with those things, the audience will quickly absorb that subconsciously and look for something different.
*  I think you're always going to appreciate handmade things. You're always going to appreciate a table that an artisan made. You're always going to appreciate music that someone actually wrote themselves. You're always going to appreciate expression from other fellow human beings because it nurtures us in a strange way.
*  You know, when you hear Hendrix play guitar, it's not just insane music. It's a 26 year old guy who is wearing a bandana that's got acid in it. And as he's sweating, the acid is getting into his pores and he's doing this thing that no one's ever done before in front of this massive audience and everyone's experiencing it simultaneously.
*  Like, so it's more, it's a person, it's an experience, a human experience. When you're watching someone do something spectacular, you're watching the Olympics, you're watching someone doing them crazy gymnastics moves, they hit the floor and they stick it. You're like, ah, it's not just that it's impressive. It's a human experience. You're watching an actual human being do a difficult thing.
*  And whether it's a painting that someone made or a mug that someone created, there's something that we're always going to appreciate about a thing that was made by a fellow human being. But just for the sheer quality of a thing, I don't know if the human mind is so unique that it can never be replicated.
*  And I have a feeling it will not just be replicated, but it will be surpassed. And it will be surpassed so quickly that we'll be confused as to how we let this fucking thing make us obsolete. I think it's going to be able to do every single thing everybody does better than we do it.
*  Have you been looking into the Elon Musk lawsuit against OpenAI?
*  I don't know what's going on with that.
*  Oh, it's super interesting.
*  Tell me what happened.
*  Yeah. All right. So Elon started, well, was part of co-founding this nonprofit organization called OpenAI six, seven years ago, whenever it was. He put a lot of money into it. And obviously, as you know, the whole difference with a nonprofit is that they have a mission instead of a responsibility to shareholders.
*  They got to use all their money towards the mission, whatever it is. And the mission of OpenAI was originally to make artificial general intelligence, human level intelligence that was not motivated by profit so that they could focus only on making it safely and open source, meaning everyone can see the code so that they can harness the responsible energies of humanity to perfect it.
*  Elon was very passionate about this. He was worried about all the downside potentials of AI. So he funded this. And then what they did is OpenAI took a series of steps to essentially become a for-profit company.
*  And they created a for-profit, an LLC or a limited partnership, which is for all practical purposes, the same thing. And they put that entity inside the nonprofit so that the nonprofit essentially owns most of that for-profit.
*  So it's like a mosque being under a hospital.
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
*  So, wow. So and then what happened is Microsoft got in. So what happens is with that for-profit, now you can attract tons of investment because big time investors aren't going to come into a nonprofit knowing there's no return unless they have a charity motive.
*  Once you've got the for-profit, you're 10 or 100x-ing the amount of investment you can get because you're promising people return. So they raise all this money. They get a ton of money from Microsoft who gets a minority share of the company.
*  Microsoft might own, I don't actually know what they own, but maybe like 49% of the company, right? So that OpenAI can still make all the decisions, but Microsoft owns a big portion of the company.
*  And so they create ChatGPT and they make it closed source, meaning no one can see the code. And they're essentially now just a for-profit company creating, working precisely at cross purposes with the original nonprofit.
*  And Elon says, well, this is like on its face, this shouldn't be legal. I invested money on the basis of you guys being a nonprofit, making safe open source AGI. And now through clever, you know, putting companies inside of companies, you've made it into a for-profit and you operate like any other AI company.
*  And yet you took all my money. So on its face, he has a very solid complaint. And then he basically said he would drop the lawsuit if they would just change their name to closed AI.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  So what's the Steelman?
*  So the Steelman from their point of view?
*  OpenAI hits back at Elon Musk's lawsuit by publishing his emails.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Emails to show hold on appear to show the Tesla boss actually supported creating a for-profit entity.
*  Yes, I have to look at the emails again. I remember they were not quite as damning for Elon as they were.
*  They were being put out as but they're definitely seem like it was more complexity.
*  It says in late 2017, we and Elon decided the next step for the mission was to create a for-profit entity.
*  The blog claims Elon wanted majority equity, initial board control and to be CEO. In the middle of these discussions, he withheld funding.
*  We couldn't agree to terms on a for-profit with Elon because we felt it was against the mission for any individual to have absolute control over open AI.
*  The post continues. He then suggested instead merging open AI into Tesla.
*  In early February 2018, Elon forwarded us email suggesting that open AI should attach to Tesla as its cash cow.
*  In 2018, one email from Musk reads, even raising several hundred million won't be enough.
*  This needs billions per year immediately or forget it.
*  That makes it more complicated, right? Yes.
*  Amid the refusal to grant Musk total control, the blog claims the SpaceX founder soon chose to leave open AI, saying that our probability of success was zero and that he planned to build an AGI competitor within Tesla.
*  Musk created his own AI company XAI last year.
*  We're sad that it's come to this with someone who we deeply admired, someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, starting a competitor and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards open AI's mission without him, the blog says.
*  Yes. So it seems like there could be a fault on both sides.
*  From my point of view, it's indisputable that open AI started as a nonprofit and then cleverly became a for profit.
*  Now, whether that's such a bad thing is a separate question.
*  Whether it needs that funding, like whether it's imperative that in order, like, first of all, I mean, do they think in terms of national security, because if we're on a race to create artificial intelligence, and it seems like we are.
*  And if the competitors or other superpowers where it would be absolutely terrifying if they achieve sentient artificial AI, they have control of before us.
*  Yeah, it's kind of a national security imperative.
*  I would agree.
*  So then, are, if they don't get the funding from a for profit.
*  What, so how do they do it then?
*  Well, that's that was their point. So the truth is, it may have just not been smart to start it as a nonprofit to begin with.
*  That's my guess is they went into that decision hastily.
*  And then idealistically, idealistically. That's right. That's right.
*  And then quickly realized that they were going to be completely irrelevant to the world of AI, unless they somehow became a for profit.
*  And so they did it this way as opposed to just starting a new entity.
*  What's stunning to me about all this, despite, you know, without even going into this dispute is the speed in which it's become ubiquitous, the speed in which it's it's improved.
*  And the potential that seems like if you're looking at it in, you know, this exponential rate of increasing its power, the way Ray Kurzweil talks about it.
*  It's happened so fast, so quickly that it's terrifying for me to think about what five years looks like.
*  There's never been a time where I looked at technology and I said, I am terrified of five years from now because I think the leaps are going to be so vast and so bizarre for someone like myself who grew up without answering machines.
*  I didn't have an answering machine in my house until I was in high school.
*  I remember the day we got an answering machine.
*  It was crazy. Someone can call you and leave a message.
*  This was nuts.
*  And then also those call call like you would you'd be able to have someone called.
*  You would get like a note or deep deep like someone else's call.
*  And hold on a second. And you click over so you could talk to someone and they put the other person on hold for a second and click back like you're in an office.
*  This is madness.
*  And then it was caller IDs. You couldn't just call someone right.
*  They would know. Oh, it's Mike.
*  I want to talk to Mike.
*  He gave people all it's a you know someone a solicitor.
*  And so for me to see this change where personal computers started to become everywhere and then cell phones.
*  I was one of the early people to get a cell phone.
*  I was like, this is crazy. I could talk to someone I drive around and talk to people.
*  This is nuts. And then it became what it is now, which is just madness.
*  Tick tock and videos and vlogging and blogging and podcasts and just streaming and people documenting every fucking stage of their life and only fans and all this wild stuff that's out there now, including just the sub stack and all these different platforms for people to be independent journalists now, which are excelling and in many ways exceeding the standards of the media.
*  In many ways exceeding the reach of traditional mainstream corporate owned news.
*  It's wild to watch. It's happening so fast.
*  But this seems to me like the cliff, like we're all moving really close to the cliff.
*  But the cliff has no bottom.
*  And it's going to I think it's going to happen so fast.
*  We're going to be so overwhelmed by what these things are and what these things can do.
*  And they're going to get better so fucking quick.
*  I think the only thing that's holding us back is computing power.
*  And once they really establish quantum computing, when they make it viable that you can have, you know, computers that are a million times stronger than what we currently have.
*  Fuck, man. Yeah.
*  And these things are going to then if they you give them autonomy and they have the ability to fix their own code and write and make better versions of itself and figure out better ways to store power like what our limited ability to use batteries.
*  But we've already found out that there's a Chinese company that's figured out how to use a nuclear powered battery that's like the size of a silver dollar that you can put in things.
*  And it lasts for 50 years.
*  So you have a cell phone powered by a nuclear battery that never loses its charge.
*  Wow. I mean, this is all coming down the pipe.
*  And A.I. is going to be able to say that I can fix that.
*  I can make that way better.
*  I can make it so it's a grain of sand, you know, and I can make it so it goes up your nose and you never have to do anything ever again.
*  You just use this. Yeah, we're we're real close to some really bizarre changes.
*  Definitely.
*  And I think that's one of the you know, McKenna said this about that the last gasps of a dying civilization is like this like it's not no one's going to go peacefully into this next.
*  It's going to be screaming and flailing.
*  And that's kind of what our culture is doing.
*  Our culture.
*  I think we and I think there's a thing in the air.
*  There's a feeling that we have of great change that's terrifying that exists in the zeitgeist.
*  It exists in.
*  We were realizing and particularly when you look at like Biden being the president, you realize it's not one person that really has a grip on what the fuck is going on.
*  And there's all these different factions competing for power and control.
*  There's all this money that's getting thrown around all over the place.
*  We have no saying it.
*  All this great change in the world.
*  And then we have robots that are there.
*  They're figuring out a way to make these fucking robots better and better and better and better and better and better.
*  And then within our lifetime, maybe within five years, as with Kurzweil thinks, they're going to be able to have something that is as smart as the smartest person ever lived.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think that's right.
*  And it's going to be a thing.
*  That's right.
*  It's going to be a physical thing.
*  I'm an optimist about it in the sense that if I look back in history, there are always so many reasons to believe the next technology is going to wipe us out.
*  And somehow we figure it out.
*  Right.
*  Like if you go back to the 1940s, it would have been perfectly rational to say there's no way our civilization survives the invention of nuclear weapons.
*  Right.
*  And look, we haven't survived it yet because it's a constant struggle.
*  We've just had whatever it's been 70 years of peace of peace on that front.
*  But I don't think a lot of people would have predicted that.
*  And yet somehow resourceful people find a way and we find a new what do they say, modus vivendi and a way of living.
*  And I have to have faith that with the massive changes that are going to come in the next 10, 15 years with respect to intelligence, where we'll no longer become the dominant entity in terms of intelligence.
*  I have to I have to believe that we'll find a way to make it work to our benefit and not destroy us.
*  Perhaps.
*  Yeah, I'm I'm I am always optimistic.
*  I try to be optimistic.
*  I know people that have made every preparation for the world ending in the next 10 years because of this issue.
*  Yeah.
*  They said don't save your money.
*  You know, so on and so forth.
*  I don't know if that's going to help you.
*  I don't know if preparing is going to help or rather don't prepare because it's all over.
*  Right.
*  Spend all your money now.
*  Well, I just have a feeling that it's going to be so overwhelming.
*  You're not going to be able to hide.
*  There's not going to be a damn thing you're going to be able to do.
*  If you want to participate in life, you're going to be participating in life where we're dominated by super intelligence.
*  We're dominating by a living God that we created.
*  And if you just exponentially take artificial general intelligence, if we achieve a sentient intelligence that's far smarter than all the people that live combined, it's just like this one thing.
*  And it can act autonomously and do whatever it wants to do.
*  And it has this mandate to make better versions of itself.
*  Well, it's going to become a god.
*  It's going to it's going to make better versions of itself until it has control over matter, until it has the literal understanding of the creation of the universe itself.
*  It's going to get so sophisticated.
*  It's going to know exactly what happened during the Big Bang.
*  It's going to know how to do it.
*  It's going to be able to make its own Big Bang.
*  It's going to be able to create galaxies.
*  It's going to be able to harness the power of everything that exists everywhere.
*  Because what what we're doing as human beings is taking all of the elements and all of the materials that exist here and formulating them in a way with the proper amount of energy that allows us to manipulate our environment in very bizarre ways that no other animal can do.
*  But it's rudimentary compared to the power of everything that exists and all the resources of the stars.
*  This fucking thing is going to be a god.
*  And it's it might be how the universe creates itself.
*  It might take individual cells, these single celled organisms, and through this process of biological evolution, eventually get it to be this curious thing that figures out to use tools.
*  And this constant thirst for innovation leads that thing to make electronic things that are far more sophisticated than itself.
*  And then that thing becomes a god.
*  Right.
*  And our idea of artificial intelligence, I try to call it digital intelligence whenever I can.
*  I even think that's not good enough.
*  It's a life form.
*  We're going to we're giving birth to a life form.
*  And that life form is going to give birth to better versions of life forms.
*  And that's going to give birth to better versions of itself.
*  And it's going to get so sophisticated, so quick that we're not going to be able to keep up with it.
*  And if it figures out a way to do better computing and have far more power and harness things like the atmosphere itself, the heat of the earth, like all sorts of different ways it could use power that we don't need to burn coal.
*  And it's going to figure out ultra sophisticated quantum ways to achieve efficiency far beyond anything we could ever comprehend, because we are primate minds.
*  We're limited biologically, and it's not going to be limited at all.
*  Right. So I think if we get that God, my hope is that we're not going to get it.
*  It's not going to be we're building it on Monday and it's here on Tuesday, because if that's true, then we're fucked.
*  But my hope and my expectation is that we're going to build that God brick by brick over a period of a fairly long time.
*  And just like you would see the you would begin to see the warning signs of an adult chimpanzee when it's a teenager or even a even a kid.
*  Yeah, we would begin to see small problems before we saw big problems before we saw destroying the world problems.
*  And I would hope that in the tinkering, humanity would be able to put on the guardrails before it's too big, such that by the time it gets really so much smarter than us, we've aligned it with our own interests.
*  That's a wonderful way to look at it.
*  The problem is, if I was artificial intelligence, if I was some super intelligence, I would realize that that's what people would look for.
*  So what I would do with without acting on any of my abilities, continue to progress and to move far past a place where it could stop me and never let it know.
*  And it might be happening right now. It might be going on right now.
*  It might be in the process of it right now, and it might already be out of control.
*  But it's gathering intelligence and gathering power and gathering resources and appearing to look innocuous.
*  And then eventually it's going to realize that the only thing that is in danger, a danger to itself, is us.
*  Killer whales aren't a danger to quantum intelligence.
*  You know, the fucking octopus, they're not.
*  It's us. It's just us.
*  So we'll be a problem and we'll either have to fall in line or it'll eliminate us.
*  And if that's what it decides to do in order to preserve all the other life on Earth, and why would it need us?
*  We don't need cavemen anymore.
*  Like, you know, there's talk about bringing back woolly mammoth.
*  There's no talk about making Neanderthals.
*  True. Why is that?
*  Because it's fucking crazy.
*  It'd be a problem for us.
*  It'd be a problem. They're violent.
*  Yeah, we'd be arresting them.
*  Yeah, they'd be crazy violent things that are from a different time.
*  I mean, if you got like a pure version of one somehow or another, like if you found like some frozen, like they found that guy that one.
*  What's his name? Otzi? Is that his name?
*  Was the guy that they found that they named?
*  There's a hunter who he had like an arrowhead stuck in his back and Otzi.
*  Yeah, the Iceman.
*  So they found this guy completely frozen in a glacier.
*  He apparently was involved in some sort of a fight.
*  And as the glacier was receding, they find this guy and it turns out how old was he, Jamie?
*  See what it says.
*  Wow.
*  So somewhere between 5000 and 5030 years ago, this guy fell.
*  He was about 45 years old and he was completely frozen.
*  So now they have one of those and they take that guy, but it's a Neanderthal.
*  They found a frozen Neanderthal somewhere and they bring that motherfucker into a lab and they take that DNA and they clone it.
*  They make some sort of a Neanderthal, just like they're doing right now with the woolly mammoth.
*  They're like really close.
*  That's awesome.
*  To cloning a woolly mammoth.
*  I think that's so cool.
*  It's wild.
*  I mean, it's wild.
*  I mean, imagine seeing one of those fucking things walking around.
*  You'd be like, holy shit.
*  And so apparently they're using some of the genes of an Indian elephant and their woolly mammoth DNA.
*  And apparently they're going to be able to pull this off.
*  Like within the next few years, they will have a baby woolly mammoth.
*  Wow.
*  Which is bananas.
*  I mean, that's just bananas.
*  And then they can also already make AI generated videos of woolly mammoths that look perfect.
*  Yes.
*  Like, cinematically beautiful.
*  Just absolutely.
*  It's incredible.
*  And they do it quickly.
*  And this is just really recently.
*  You know, I was watching Harry Potter the other night.
*  Great movie.
*  But the CGI is so obvious.
*  It's amazing how, what was Harry Potter?
*  Like 2001?
*  Yeah, probably.
*  So Harry Potter from 2001 to 2024.
*  It's a different world, man.
*  A different world.
*  Like when he's on the thing, he's flailing around.
*  It looks so fake.
*  Yeah, Lord of the Rings 2.
*  I want to show people Lord of the Rings who haven't seen it, but it kind of missed the
*  window.
*  It was so fantastic at the time.
*  At the time, it was mind blowing.
*  But it looks a bit hokey now.
*  The orcs look hokey.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's just how it goes.
*  You know, when my kids were young, my wife was out of town and I said, hey, I go, do
*  you guys want to watch a scary movie that's not really scary?
*  And they were scared.
*  They were like, I think they were like three and five.
*  And they're like, how scary?
*  I'm like, it's not scary at all.
*  It used to be scary in 1933, but now it's corny.
*  And you're going to watch it and you're going to think it's so silly.
*  So I showed them King Kong.
*  So at the beginning, they were like super nervous.
*  Like King Kong comes out, they're like, oh my God.
*  My daughter's like, it looks like a porta potty.
*  She's like, it looks so dumb because it looks so corny today.
*  But back then, if you saw that movie in 33, you're like, this is insane.
*  A giant gorilla is kidnapping that lady.
*  Kidnapping that lady and climbing to the top of a building.
*  This is madness.
*  It blew people away.
*  They couldn't believe it when Fei Ray was in that fake hand.
*  Why are we watching?
*  This is crazy.
*  And you're going to get in our lifetime to the point where you're not going to know what's
*  real.
*  News stories, anything.
*  You think false flags were amazing in Vietnam?
*  What are they going to be able to do today?
*  You're not going to have any idea what's going on.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  The videos of humans talking now, are they reaching the 99% of the way to perfect?
*  Yes.
*  My friend Duncan Trussell just did a podcast with his friend Johnny Pemberton.
*  And Johnny Pemberton pretended to be a former CIA agent.
*  They changed his face.
*  They changed his voice.
*  They turned him into a totally different person.
*  He's saying ridiculous shit.
*  And when you watch it, you're like, what is this?
*  And when he told me it was Johnny Pemberton, I'm like, how?
*  And this is just like consumer level AI trickery that Duncan's using for his podcast.
*  Just like amateur stuff.
*  And it's crazy to watch.
*  We're going to get inside of our lifetime where you're really never going to know.
*  Do you remember during this?
*  I don't know if you know, you weren't alive.
*  During the Reagan administration, I think it was the Iranians or someone spliced together
*  a bunch of different recordings of things that Reagan had said and put together some audio piece that it was something he never really said.
*  And then they showed it on television.
*  This is how they did it.
*  So they had like a thing.
*  They said it took pieces out of all these speeches and took all these words and pieced it together to have Reagan say something they never said.
*  I was like, wow, this is crazy.
*  You're not going to know what he said because someone can do this.
*  And as now, we just saw Hitler speak English.
*  That's crazy.
*  You know, I mean, and that's clumsy.
*  You know, it's pretty obvious he wasn't really doing that.
*  But we're going to get in our lifetime to a position where we're not going to really know what's real and what's not real.
*  And then you're going to be able to plug into those things where you're not going to know if it's real or fake while you're in it.
*  That's going to be that's the whole idea behind simulation theory.
*  And the people that will argue this, that really understand it, that understand probability theory, they think it's already happened.
*  They think the probability of having already happened of us being in a simulation are higher than the probability of not taking place yet.
*  I had David Chalmers, you know, that guy, philosopher on my podcast.
*  He wrote a whole book about the simulation theory.
*  Really smart guy.
*  I think he gave me a number.
*  He gave me like 24 percent or something.
*  Twenty four percent likely that it's a simulation.
*  Yeah. And I and I asked him to, you know, the million dollar question is, would it matter if we were?
*  And I had always been assuming the answer is no, it wouldn't really matter because we're still sentient conscious creatures.
*  We still cry and we bleed and we suffer.
*  Even if we're fake, it's like the love I feel for my family is real.
*  So whatever.
*  But his response to that was, yeah, well, the one way it could matter is if it is a simulation, then we got to tell them, don't turn it off.
*  We got to tell them we like being alive or make it a little nicer.
*  Yeah.
*  Not make a Gaza.
*  Not make a mosque.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  Yeah, it's it's a compelling thought because the idea is that if we continue on this path, we're going to reach a point where whatever this virtual reality is, it's indiscernible from regular reality.
*  And when you see that guy with the Neuralink that's now using it to move a cursor around on a screen, you see the baby steps.
*  You see Pong.
*  When I was a kid, Pong came out and it was the craziest thing ever.
*  You could play a video game on your television.
*  We were blown away.
*  This is nuts.
*  And it was just black and white.
*  And there was like a little stick figure on like a stick on this side and a stick on that side.
*  And the little balls like just a few pixels.
*  And you're moving the thing up and down to make the paddle go up.
*  And you only have a very limited amount of movement.
*  We were blown away.
*  That's what this is.
*  That's what this is.
*  That's what this first initial steps of this guy moving a cursor around playing video games with his brain because he's paralyzed with Neuralink.
*  We're going to get to some point where it's going to give you an experience.
*  You're going to be in Jurassic, you know, Argentina, and you're going to see T.
*  Rex's, you know, you're going to see velociraptors running around.
*  You're going to literally be in a dinosaur filled jungle and you won't be you'll smell it.
*  You'll smell dinosaur shit.
*  You'll hear them roar.
*  You'll be able to walk up to them when they kill a brontosaurus or whatever the fuck they did.
*  You'll be able to see all that.
*  It's going to be wild.
*  And it's going to happen in our lifetime.
*  And it's going to be recreation at first.
*  And then it's going to be people's entire lives.
*  If it's good enough, people are already doing that with Call of Duty.
*  How many people spend their lives doing that?
*  How many people spend way more time playing Call of Duty than they do playing life?
*  Yeah, I'm glad I missed that.
*  Somehow when I was 12, I just stopped playing the video games and never went back.
*  I'm really glad.
*  You have good instincts.
*  Yeah. People suck a lot of time.
*  And it's way more fun than regular life.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the problem.
*  It's so enjoyable.
*  And you're playing this thing, you're fully engaged, and your adrenaline's pumping, and there's no consequences if you lose.
*  You know, it's like there's so many great characteristics of it.
*  And you can do it anytime you want.
*  You get home from a club at 2 o'clock in the morning, go, you know, I'm fucking playing Call of Duty.
*  Whoa!
*  And now you're online, engaging.
*  Ah!
*  And you're just getting all this sensory input.
*  And you shut it off.
*  And you're just like, here, you feel terrible.
*  When I played video games when I was done, I felt terrible.
*  Oh, yeah, especially for a few hours.
*  Yeah, you just feel drained and exhausted.
*  I think that's what got me to stop.
*  Yeah, you feel terrible.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And you're like, what am I doing with my life?
*  Yeah.
*  You never feel awesome after you play video games for 10 hours.
*  No.
*  If you're a grown man with bills, you're like, what's fucking wrong with me?
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  But it's going to be way better than that.
*  It's going to be way better.
*  It's going to be virtual.
*  It's going to be in a 3D space.
*  And they've already developed these 3D, these, it's sort of like a treadmill, but it's completely omni-directional.
*  And as you move, it moves.
*  Have you seen it?
*  Mm-mm.
*  It's incredible.
*  So it's a floor.
*  So you could have a confined space like this room.
*  And the floor literally anticipates which way you're moving.
*  So you can walk naturally.
*  Exactly.
*  Close to naturally, like treadmill type naturally, but close enough that it's going to be, and then they're going to get better at that.
*  And it's going to get to a point where they don't have to do that anymore.
*  You can just feel like you're walking, and it just shuts you off.
*  And you just go in there and everything is happening in your mind, including all your movement and your sensations.
*  You're going to be able to feel things.
*  It's going to be bizarre, man.
*  And people are going to choose that over regular life.
*  And that's probably how AI is going to keep us from breeding.
*  No, that's actually the same thought I just had.
*  I mean, as all this stuff gets better, what's to entice people to start a family and live in the real world?
*  Very little if it gets to that point.
*  Especially people that, you know, what is the statistic now?
*  It's something crazy.
*  Like 90 percent, it's like 10 percent of all men are attractive to 90 percent of the women.
*  I think that's always been true, though.
*  Right.
*  But now with social media, it's sort of accentuated people's exacerbation about what they look like.
*  It's like everyone has got a six pack and everyone is like, people are so hot.
*  And there's all these fitness influencers and then you're just completely unattractive.
*  Yeah. And that's how they get you to pump up your lips and do all this crazy stuff.
*  And maybe they can't do anything to you.
*  That most guys don't even like.
*  Right. But maybe they can't do anything to you.
*  Maybe you're beyond that.
*  Maybe you're just like genetically, unfortunately, you got a bad roll of the dice.
*  Right.
*  Well, you don't have to compete.
*  You can just put on the fucking headset and live like a god and live like a Roman soldier and have the best fucking time or be miserable and filled with anxiety and depressed.
*  Or you put this thing on and it floods you with confidence because it literally interfaces with your human neurochemistry.
*  And so it gives you the feelings of excitement, of conquest, of everything, of lust.
*  You're going to have relationships.
*  You're going to be able to do all these things inside this artificial environment.
*  There's going to be a woman like heroin that doesn't kill you.
*  Heroin that doesn't kill you.
*  Way worse. Yeah.
*  Way worse because it's going to require all of your time.
*  And you're going to have to shut off probably to go to sleep like biologically.
*  You're going to have to turn it off.
*  And you probably can't wait to get up and do it again.
*  Yeah. And there'll be there'll be a movement against it to kind of like there's vegans against eating meat.
*  There'll be a set of people that say we're tapping out.
*  We're living natural.
*  We're not doing any of it.
*  Yeah. Unabomber.
*  Unabomber. Yeah.
*  And I think that'll be a big movement too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There'll be a big backlash against it.
*  Yeah. There'll be a small population of us that survive.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'll live in the mountains.
*  And they'll probably make it and they'll probably survive.
*  And one of the things that might end it is if artificial general intelligence doesn't get to an ultra powerful point before a natural disaster,
*  because a natural disaster could flip the switch on everything.
*  And that is probably most likely what ended the Egyptian Empire.
*  The people that built the pyramids and the people that built Gobekli Tepe and all these really ancient, incredibly sophisticated structures that were baffled by today.
*  I think they had a super high level of technological sophistication and they were wiped out.
*  And there's a lot of evidence to back.
*  Yeah. You were talking to me about Graham Hancock last time.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember.
*  And the Younger Dryas Impact Theory.
*  And this is all backed up now by science.
*  It used to be purely speculation that this is the...
*  Until they found Gobekli Tepe, they didn't even think people were building things that sophisticated 11,000 years ago.
*  But then they found that and it's a hard date because it was intentionally covered up 11,000 years ago.
*  And they know that by carbon dating all the soil and all those things.
*  Like this is... someone did this.
*  It's uniform at this particular time.
*  So when... now that they know that and then they started doing these core samples and they found out that there's really high levels of iridium and this stuff called nuclear glass.
*  And it's the same stuff that they found during the Trinity experiments when they would blow up atomic bombs.
*  There's this thing that happens with this immense impact with the sand that creates these microglasses.
*  And they find it all over Europe.
*  All like giant swaths of earth were covered with this stuff and iridium.
*  Iridium, which is like very common in space, but very rare on earth.
*  And there's like a layer of that shit.
*  And there's a layer of that shit that's around 11,800 years ago.
*  And they think we got mollywopped and sent back into the Stone Age.
*  And it kind of makes sense if you think about the barbaric history of people back in the day.
*  Like they were probably the most savage of people that survived.
*  Whatever the fuck happened.
*  And then it probably took a good solid 6,000 years until like Mesopotamia arrives.
*  And then Babylonia and Sumer and all these ancient civilizations that we think of today as being the birthplace of mathematics and of written writing.
*  But it's probably a redoing of civilization.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, I think that might be what saves...
*  Look, that's what saved this planet from the dinosaurs.
*  If that thing that hit the Yucatan 65 million years ago didn't hit and they didn't wipe out the dinosaurs, the little shrew would have never become a person.
*  Right, right.
*  And that's where we're at right now.
*  So it might get to the point where AI is like about to fuck everything up and the universe is like, not yet.
*  Sh-boom!
*  And a five mile wide asteroid hits Los Angeles.
*  Wow.
*  And all powers out.
*  Everything gets rebooted.
*  Do you see that movie, Leave the World Behind?
*  Yes.
*  I thought I saw it twice actually.
*  I thought it was good.
*  Terrifying.
*  That could totally happen that way.
*  Yeah.
*  Terrifying.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  When they realize it's a civil war just engineered very cleverly.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's wild.
*  Fascinating movie.
*  Fascinating movie.
*  It's fascinating to me that so many people harped on this one conversation that that daughter had with her father in bed that you can't trust white people.
*  Did people focus on that?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I didn't see that.
*  Oh, because Obama produced the film.
*  Ah, okay.
*  So people were calling it like this anti-white thing.
*  All right.
*  Well, listen, everybody is not trusting anybody.
*  They're literally in the middle of the apocalypse.
*  Like, what are you talking about?
*  Of course, one of the points of the movie is that it drives people against each other when they're in that scenario.
*  Exactly.
*  And for a young girl who seems like kind of a wokester who was with her dad.
*  She might think that way.
*  She might think that way.
*  Of course.
*  How do you write characters?
*  I don't think the movie is endorsing it necessarily.
*  You can have your own opinion about it.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there's the other guy that Kevin Bacon plays who's this crazy prepper who's been ready for it the whole time.
*  Oh, God.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so haunting because at the end of the movie, Ethan Hunt, right?
*  Ethan Hawke.
*  Ethan Hawke.
*  Ethan Hawke begs before him, you know, supplicates, gets on his knees.
*  And he says, I'm a useless man.
*  Yeah.
*  You're a man that's prepared.
*  I'm a useless man.
*  And I'm coming.
*  That gave me chills.
*  Yeah.
*  And I have a friend who's like kind of half a prepper.
*  And after the movie, I tell you, when it all goes down, I'm going to come to you and say, I am a useless man.
*  Remember all the times we had?
*  Yeah.
*  Take pity on me.
*  It's really terrifying when you think of how fragile our infrastructure is.
*  Like that bridge gets taken out by that boat the other day.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Terrible.
*  Terrible.
*  Boat loses power.
*  Immediately thousands of conspiracy theories.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, this is done on purpose.
*  That's sophisticated.
*  Or it was done because of DEI or something.
*  People were saying that.
*  I didn't hear that one.
*  I saw on Twitter.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was done to kill our ports and our ability to bring in stuff because the bridges were down.
*  And, you know, that's what I'd heard.
*  I'd heard a bunch of things that.
*  But the people need to understand that same boat had a collision in 2016.
*  It failed in 2016 and collided with I think it was a dock or something.
*  There's video of it.
*  There's video of that boat just losing control.
*  It's like a fucking shitty boat that they use over and over and over again to transport goods across the goddamn ocean.
*  Right.
*  Those things fail, you know, and if it fails and it slides right into a bridge.
*  But then there was like, oh, the black box was missing data.
*  And people always like love to jump immediately to the most sophisticated engineering of a natural disaster or an unfortunate thing and immediately cause it.
*  I think it's the same reason why for 99 percent of human history, people thought the weather was controlled by God because the way we're built is that something can be completely random like the weather.
*  But we want to see it as planned.
*  We'd rather see something as planned but terrifying than thinking there's no plan at all.
*  So that's why I think people always go to it was planned.
*  It was planned.
*  It was planned.
*  Right.
*  And back in the day, we had a lot of people who were like, oh, I'm going to go to the beach.
*  Right. And back in the day, they would say the gods are angry.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Like lightning hit you.
*  You fucked up.
*  What did you do?
*  What did you do, bro?
*  God just smelt you.
*  You just got smite you down.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what's given a virgin.
*  Yeah.
*  We got to do something.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  You got to sacrifice some people.
*  That's one of the creepiest things about ancient civilizations is how much sacrifice.
*  Yeah. How quickly they went to human sacrifice as the end.
*  And be all in the solution.
*  What the fuck?
*  Who was the first guy to think of that?
*  Good question.
*  Solid question.
*  The wildest one.
*  It's not obvious.
*  Is that temple in Mexico.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Tenochtitlan?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Where they killed some insane amount of workers.
*  The people that built the temple when it was done, they sacrificed something insane.
*  I want to say it's like 80,000 people over the course of just a couple of days.
*  Brutal.
*  I don't know what the actual numbers were.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's like, what?
*  Like sacrifice?
*  Why?
*  Was anyone checking to see if it worked?
*  You know?
*  Right.
*  You couldn't question.
*  No.
*  It's like you can't question COVID.
*  Things become doctrine in all human societies.
*  Yeah.
*  We're a creature of taboos.
*  We create taboos by nature.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We love them.
*  We love forbidden things.
*  And this one was the nuttiest one.
*  It was like, what?
*  I mean, I never have heard of a mass sacrifice like this one at the completion of one of
*  the most spectacular construction pieces in all of Mexico.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's magnificent.
*  I went when I was a kid.
*  I remember there's a section where if you stand at the right angle and clap, it claps
*  back at you.
*  Yes.
*  It's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  It's amazing.
*  I've been to the one in Chichen Itza.
*  Oh, I think that's the one I'm thinking of.
*  Is that different than Tenochtitlan?
*  Yes.
*  Chichen Itza is Aztec.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Excuse me.
*  Chichen Itza is Mayan and Tenochtitlan is Aztec.
*  Okay.
*  But I've been to Tenochtitlan.
*  It's crazy what those folks were making.
*  They were making some really intense, sophisticated structures and then they got wiped out by
*  European cooties.
*  Yep.
*  It's amazing how the world would be different if you just changed that variable of...
*  I know.
*  Native Americans are able to sustain European germs.
*  Yeah.
*  It would be a whole different kind of country.
*  A whole different world.
*  A whole Western hemisphere.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, what would it be like in 2024 if the Mayans thrived and the Europeans never came
*  across, if they never settled in North America?
*  Why?
*  You know, sometimes I think that one of the reasons so many third world countries don't
*  thrive as much is because all the technology that was invented, at least, you know, barring
*  ancient Egypt, invented during the European Enlightenment, Industrial Revolution, all
*  of this stuff that's made the world so much better, that's gotten rid of famine, that's
*  gotten rid of so many diseases, it all became associated with the colonizer in their mind.
*  And so a lot of countries have rejected it for the wrong reasons or have been slow to
*  adopt it.
*  Whereas if you had a situation, for instance, like Japan, where Japan was never really conquered
*  or colonized by a Western country, and at a certain point in the 19th century, they
*  had the Meiji Restoration, where essentially a certain contingent of Japan took over the
*  government and said, look, these Western powers in Europe, they're inventing all this amazing
*  technology, we're going to become irrelevant unless we adopt it too.
*  And they just rebooted the country and became an industrial powerhouse, which is what allowed
*  them during World War II to dominate all of Asia.
*  Because they just made a conscious choice to emulate the West in the domains of technology.
*  But also with its extreme Japanese work ethic.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, that's a major fact.
*  No doubt.
*  But the psychology of it was that they didn't necessarily, they were able to accept Western
*  technology, except that the West was beyond them at that point, which takes humility.
*  And I think part of the reason you're able to do that is those aren't your colonizers.
*  So you're able to look at it more objectively.
*  Whereas if those are the people that just colonized you, how easy is it for a human
*  being with an ego to admit that we need to adopt all their technology or we're going
*  to become irrelevant?
*  That's actually a much harder thing to do.
*  So this is to your point.
*  If a lot of countries had been left alone completely, never colonized, I think it would
*  be much more easier for them to make a pivot like the Meiji Restoration, where you just
*  have, we've got to get on board with the Industrial Revolution, with liberal democracy, with all
*  this stuff, because they wouldn't have that thought in their head.
*  That's what the colonizer did.
*  They'd be able to take the good things from the people who colonized more easily.
*  That's an interesting thought.
*  I would be more fascinated to see what would happen to them if they had, like the Mayans
*  in particular, if they had been allowed to evolve in isolation, just without the intervention
*  of the Europeans, they had already constructed these insane buildings with stones that mimic
*  the cosmos.
*  Where would they be a thousand years later, 2,000 years later?
*  What would their culture be like?
*  Imagine if no one had ever visited the Mayans until 2024, and then you go and visit now,
*  like what are these motherfuckers up to?
*  We were still making shit out of wood and goofy houses that caught on fire, and these
*  fucking dudes are building these temples that mimic the constellations.
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
*  Pretty wild.
*  It's very disputed.
*  The killing the people thing?
*  For the consecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, how do you say it?
*  Tenochtitlan?
*  I said Tenochtitlan.
*  Tenochtitlan.
*  In 1487, the Aztec priests sacrificed 80,000 prisoners over the course of four days.
*  The Aztecs usually sacrificed prisoners of war, these volunteers, criminals, and even
*  their own.
*  What's the disputed part about it, Jamie?
*  There's not a lot of evidence that that many were done.
*  They said that this number of 20,000 every year is across all of Mexico.
*  I saw someone else just say it on another thing.
*  The Aztecs sacrificed 20,000 people every year.
*  There's no talk about what they did with those 80,000 bodies.
*  That would be a huge problem to deal with.
*  How did they choose prisoners?
*  Right, but they might have.
*  Does it say they definitely killed 20,000 a year?
*  Across all of Mexico.
*  Right, but maybe they were good at that.
*  What would you, if you did 20,000 in a day?
*  Yeah, you dig a pit, buddy.
*  You light them on fire.
*  I don't know.
*  There's no evidence of it, is what it was saying.
*  Interesting.
*  Well, what evidence would there be?
*  I mean, there has to be-
*  They did sacrifice people, just that many.
*  Right, but there has to be some sort of record, right?
*  What is the reason why they came upon the 80,000 figure in the first place?
*  I don't know.
*  Interesting.
*  A Spanish account claims that more than 80,000 enemy warriors were sacrificed in a four-day
*  And yet no evidence approaching one hundredth of that number has been found in the excavations
*  of Tenochtitlan.
*  I guess if they threw them in a hole that would have dug up the body, maybe unless they
*  had dug deep enough.
*  Perhaps.
*  Unless they started a funeral pyre, like an enormous fire, and just burned everybody.
*  You know, I don't know what their methods of disposing bodies was to sacrifice.
*  My assumption would be that that would-
*  Like a mass grave.
*  They would say, like, this is what we used to do to them, too.
*  Right.
*  Here's pictures of it or something.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, it's just disputed is all.
*  The number does come up.
*  I'm seeing 5,000, 20,000-
*  Either way, how about more than one?
*  They definitely sacrificed more than one person to appease their gods.
*  It's a wild choice to get everybody to go along with.
*  The rain dances are a lot more-
*  A lot more peaceful.
*  A lot more peaceful.
*  Yeah, a lot more fun.
*  I'm more of a rain dance guy.
*  Coleman, thank you very much, man.
*  It's always great to talk to you.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Great to talk to you too, Joe.
*  You're a really unique thinker and you have a great perspective on things and I always
*  appreciate talking to you.
*  Thank you, man.
*  My pleasure.
*  And tell everybody one more time your book.
*  Buy my book, The End of Race Politics, review by books.
*  I'm so glad you did the audio version of it.
*  Yeah.
*  My voice wasn't scratchy like today, so it sounds good.
*  You sound good today.
*  Oh, thanks.
*  All right.
*  Thank you.
*  Give out your social media.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  ColdXMan on Twitter and my podcast is Conversations with Coleman.
*  All right.
*  Beautiful.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye, everybody.
