# Joe Rogan Experience #1379 - Ben Westhoff
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 07, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxwgwaLS7KI)
*  Ben, thank you for having me, Joe.
*  My pleasure. This is a subject that scares the shit out of me.
*  How did you stumble upon the story of Fentanyl? Because weren't you, at one point in time,
*  didn't you write about rap music?
*  Yeah, I have a book about NWA and Tupac, and I interviewed Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg,
*  all those people. Yeah. But I was the LA Weekly Music Editor, and I started looking into this
*  story about why people were always dying at raves. So like, I don't know if you remember a few years
*  back, every time there was a rave, they're like one person died, two people died, or more. And
*  they always said it was from ecstasy. But I knew that ecstasy was really not that dangerous of a
*  drug. You know, MDMA, pure MDMA, very few people die from that. So I was like, what is going on
*  here? And I looked into it and turned out it was all adulterated. It wasn't real ecstasy,
*  it wasn't real molly. It was adulterated with all these new drugs. And I kind of went down the
*  rabbit hole. And I found out that all these new drugs were made in China. They're all synthetic.
*  And there were like hundreds of them. And then it turns out that the most,
*  you know, the worst of them was Fentanyl. And that's how I got onto the topic.
*  And Fentanyl, most people think of Fentanyl, they think of it as being a new thing. But it's not
*  really a new thing, right? Wasn't it, it was invented in the 50s?
*  Yeah. Yeah, it was invented by a Belgian chemist. He was trying to find something that worked better
*  than morphine in hospitals.
*  Doesn't morphine work really good?
*  Well, it does. But for things like, yeah, traditionally, people have gotten a lot of
*  mileage out of morphine. But for things like open heart surgery, he wanted something that came on
*  really fast, and it lasted a long time. And so he manipulated the chemical structure of morphine,
*  came up with Fentanyl. It was a blockbuster drug, you know, and still is used in hospitals
*  all the time. It's used, you know, there's the Fentanyl patch for people with cancer,
*  chronic pain. And then when you get a like a colonoscopy, they give you Fentanyl before that.
*  And then women who have epidurals during childbirth, that I believe is usually Fentanyl.
*  So it's still an important hospital drug.
*  And so how did it come to be that this drug from the 1950s sort of re-emerges?
*  And it re-emerged during the rave scene? Is that what it was?
*  It was actually before that. It first started killing people a little bit at the beginning
*  of the 80s. And nobody knew what it was. And it was from China then as well?
*  No. Back then, it was these kind of mystery chemists, these guys who there was this one guy
*  in particular called George Marquardt. And he was like a genius maniac who read all the chemical
*  literature. He learned about Fentanyl. He's like, I should try to make this. I bet it would be a hit
*  with recreational users. And so he started making it. And it stumped authorities because
*  these people would die. They would have track marks in their arms like it was heroin. They would have
*  syringes, but they tested them afterwards and there's no heroin in their system.
*  And so they're like, what is this? And the only way they finally found out was that there was this
*  scientist testing racing horses. And apparently Fentanyl was being used to dope horses.
*  What?
*  So they would withstand more pain and would go longer and faster and could train harder.
*  Yeah. And so this guy made the connection. He's like, oh, this is Fentanyl. This is this new thing.
*  And he actually predicted what was going to happen. He's like, we are in trouble now because
*  not only is there Fentanyl, you can make a new, if you ban Fentanyl, you can adjust the molecule,
*  make another type of Fentanyl. When they ban that, you can make another one, add Infinitum basically.
*  Wow. So the thing with horses would be that they would be in pain so they wouldn't run as hard.
*  So they would force them to run harder by dulling the pain.
*  I guess so. Yeah. I don't know all the details of it, but you know, it's performance enhancing.
*  Basically, it seemed kind of counterintuitive. You would think that like an opiate would like
*  make them sleepy, right? Well, I don't know all the details.
*  Maybe it just has a different effect on horses. So then the internet comes along. And through the
*  internet, people started scouring the medical literature and scientific literature and chemical
*  literature, and then they find Fentanyl. Exactly. Yeah. Because back in the old days,
*  scientists would publish a paper, they're trying to find a new drug that they can patent,
*  say the drug isn't a hit, no one wants to buy it. It goes on some dusty university shelf,
*  never is heard from again. But in the internet age, all these papers start going online.
*  And so these rogue chemists that I reference in the title of my book, they start finding particular
*  scientists who work on the type of drugs they're interested in. And then they start going through
*  all their papers. And they pick out drugs that they think would work recreationally.
*  And so when Fentanyl first came out, it was totally legal. People you could walk around
*  with a giant bag of it, they couldn't do anything. And so it set in motion this sort of cat and mouse
*  game between law enforcement and drug chemists, which really still persists to this day, although
*  mostly in China now. Have you ever experienced any opiates personally? I've taken Yeah, like
*  tramadol and like Tylenol 3 and stuff like that. Tylenol 3 is opiates? I think it's codeine,
*  which is a low level opioid. And I don't know, to me, it always gets me stoned, but it never seems
*  to like deal with the problem. I don't really like opioids. You know what I mean? It's like I can't
*  sleep. And it's just not my thing. It's not your thing. Yeah. I had the old Nyquil had codeine,
*  didn't it? Didn't it? Didn't it? Do we we've been over this, haven't we?
*  Didn't we try to figure this out? I remember I took Nyquil in the 90s, in the late 90s. I was
*  sick. It was like the last time I ever took it. And it was wonderful. I was lying in bed going,
*  this is amazing. I don't even give a shit if I'm tired. I'm sick. A lot of people say that.
*  I just sank into the bed. I was like, ah, and another time I had a morphine drip, I had knee
*  surgery, and they gave me a little morphine drip and anything. Anytime I wanted, I could just hit
*  this button and get a little bit more. I was hammering that just lying in bed.
*  Pete Slauson Well, that's like the irony of the opioids. It can produce the greatest pleasure
*  and the greatest pain. You know, I think Sam Quinones said that like, how can one molecule
*  give you the greatest pleasure imaginable and the worst pain imaginable?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, Lenny Bruce had some crazy quote about it, something about
*  that was like getting hugged by God. I forget what the quote was. But I've never had experience with
*  heroin. But I knew, I've known people that were addicts, quite a few and a couple of them that
*  died. And one of them that I knew, there was this guy who was a pool hustler back in my pool playing
*  days in New York. And his nickname was Water Dog. I forget his real name. I think it was Bill.
*  But no, that was Buffalo Bill's other nickname. I don't remember his real name. But anyway,
*  this guy was an elite pool player, big time gambler. But the thing was, he had to do heroin first.
*  So, like, they would play games for like $10,000, these huge games. And all these guys would come
*  from the tri-state area, they would come around to watch these matches in bed on the side.
*  And Water Dog would go to the bathroom and everybody knew what was going on. He would go
*  and shoot up. And then he would come and he would sit on a chair like this. Just sit there for like
*  half an hour. Just sit there. And then when it was over, when the half hour was over, he would just
*  like, okay. And then he would go and play. And he couldn't miss. And he was playing this guy,
*  this dude that I knew named George, who was also a big time gambler. And he was just screaming and
*  yelling that this motherfucker, when he's on this stuff, he can't miss. He had no nerves.
*  Nothing bothered him. You could scream in his face. He would look at you like an alien. It didn't
*  bother him at all. Like an insect would look at you. And he had this incredible ability to play
*  at the very best while he was fucked up on heroin. And I remember thinking, what a bizarre drug.
*  Think about all the amazing artists that it's claimed.
*  Yeah, I think about jazz and all the great improv.
*  John Coltrane, yes. Lenny Bruce, so many people. You go down the line, all these different folks.
*  Mugshot that I have out there of Hendrix. That was heroin.
*  Oh, it was? Okay.
*  Got heroin in Toronto.
*  Yeah. I mean, people prefer heroin to fentanyl. I've heard it described as more
*  soulful, people say. But the thing is, you can't even get heroin in most parts of America,
*  like pure heroin anymore. It's all cut with fentanyl.
*  Well, you got to go straight to Afghanistan, right?
*  That's probably, yeah, probably Mexico. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Jesus Christ. Now, can you grow poppies? Like, can that be grown in the North American climate?
*  Yeah, I've heard that, like, if you just walk around on the street, like,
*  nice neighborhoods, you'll see poppies all the time. You just don't even know you're looking at
*  them. And that's actually heroin. Like, you could get heroin from those poppies.
*  Yeah. It's like, if they grow organically and you're not doing it on purpose, it's no big deal. But
*  if you start cultivating it, that's when it becomes a lot.
*  It's just got to place too. I don't know. They're beautiful. Look how pretty.
*  Yeah. Do you also have San Pedro cactus on your lawn, sir? Oh, those are pretty too.
*  Right. Yeah. I mean, those cactuses, I can't imagine there are a lot of trained
*  police who know what to look for. I feel like if you're going to grow some mescal, you know,
*  mescaline cacti or whatever, you're probably going to be all right.
*  Just mix it up with regular cactus. Pretend you're a cactus enthusiast.
*  Yeah. Just have it all over your lawn.
*  Some succulents.
*  Yeah, I'm just really into cactus, man. They're pretty. They have some water. I might go out of
*  town a lot. So what scares me is, I mean, I just know people that party. I know people that take
*  pills. And it seems like fentanyl is, things are getting cut with fentanyl a lot. It's not
*  an uncommon thing for all sorts of different drugs. How many different drugs are cut with
*  fentanyl? Street drugs.
*  Oh, man. It is like an awful time to be a young person on the party scene. You know, like when I
*  was coming up and probably when you were coming up, they said the D.A.R.E. program and all that,
*  just say no. They made it sound like every drug could kill you, right?
*  Now, unfortunately, that's like almost reality that basically any pill or any powder,
*  if you didn't get your pill from CVS, you know, your pain pill or from a pharmacy, that's legit.
*  It could be cut with fentanyl. And that's how Prince died. That's how Tom Petty and the rapper
*  Mac Miller all died, is that they thought they were taking legitimate pain pills.
*  Is that really what happened?
*  That is really what happened. Yeah.
*  So Prince got his from the black market?
*  Yeah. Well, the guy who supplied Prince has been, he refuses to really say exactly where he got it.
*  He's still alive?
*  The guy who got him for Prince, yeah.
*  Where is he?
*  I don't know. I think in Minneapolis or something.
*  They should find that fucking guy.
*  Well, the doctor is also like settled or something. I think the doctor might have
*  been involved somehow. It's a mystery where he got these pills. But you know, Prince was like
*  doing the splits on stage at age, you know, 58 or whatever. And he was definitely a guy who walked
*  around with a lot of pain. He was Jehovah's Witness. He was not a recreational drug user
*  as we think about it. You know, he wanted pain. And I'm sure for years, his handler or whatever
*  was buying them off the dark net or whatever. And they were fine for years. But then a drug
*  dealer trying to save some money, increase profits, cut it with fentanyl. And that's how he died.
*  And I heard Tom Petty actually suffered an injury or hurt himself at one of his concerts.
*  And he just literally walked outside and asked like the first sketchy guy he saw
*  if he had any pain pills. And that's what killed him.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Oh, God. And Prince needed hip replacement surgery, didn't he?
*  I think that's right.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's so common for some reason with people who perform on stage,
*  who do a lot of like jumping around and going crazy. My friend Maynard, lead singer of Tool.
*  Yeah.
*  He was, he does jiu jitsu. He's really into jiu jitsu. And he's like, man, I just have no movement
*  in my hip. My hip is like so locked up. And the doctor went to look at it and they're like, hey,
*  bro, you've got no hip left. Like it's just shot. And it was from stomping on stage.
*  Oh, really?
*  He sings, he fucking stomps all the time. And that one hip, he just wore that hip out.
*  Yeah. My mom has these issues with her neck. It's like degenerative disc disease. And you know,
*  you've got this like cushy, spongy, you know.
*  Well, they can do something about that now.
*  Can they?
*  Yeah. Before your mom goes and gets her neck cut open, there's several options. One, first of all,
*  as it's been explained to me, the concept of degenerative disc disease, it gives you this,
*  it implies that there's a disease. Like you caught a flu.
*  That's what I thought too.
*  It's not. What it is, is bad posture, wearing down, compression, carrying weight. If people
*  carry a lot of things, their disc gets smushed over time. There's a lot of different factors.
*  A lot of athletes get it. A lot of fighters get it. A lot of wrestlers, jiu jitsu guys,
*  they all get it. I got it. And what-
*  Oh, you did? Where did you get it?
*  My neck. And it was from getting my neck yanked on, you know,
*  getting it cranked on and using it to like move people around when you're doing jiu jitsu and
*  grappling. But I found a thing called Regenikine. Regenikine is what Peyton Manning used. He
*  actually went to Germany to go do it, but now he can do it here in America. Kobe Bryant went and
*  got it done as well. It's great for people with back issues, disc issues, and with bulging discs
*  in particular, it helps relax the area around the disc. It's your own blood and there's some sort of
*  strange procedure they do, but they take your own blood. It's like a very advanced form of
*  platelet-rich plasma. And there's a place called Lifespan Medicine in Santa Monica that did it for
*  me. But I had like- And you got like full-
*  Oh yeah. Full everything back.
*  Everything back, yeah. I mean, depending upon how far gone it is, you know, some people it's
*  already bone on bone. There's no disc left, you know, and you got to catch it before that happens.
*  Yeah. And then another thing they're doing is they're shooting stem cells directly into the
*  discs. And they're having some really good results with that where the stem cells- But a lot of that,
*  they'll be doing that in other countries because they're a lot looser with their regulations. If
*  they have any regulation at all, they can just fucking fill you up with stem cells and you're
*  like, and everything starts regenerating. Yeah. But yeah, and it's not just these pills
*  either. It's like, you have daughters, I know, who are getting towards their teenage years,
*  right? Yeah. And like, that's the thing I worry the most about is I have kids too. And just,
*  yeah, because I used to, you know, I wasn't discriminated. I didn't care.
*  Right. And especially if you're drinking, if you're a young kid and you're drinking,
*  you're not going to make wise decisions. You don't even know what you're doing. If you're a young kid,
*  you're 18, 19 years old and you have three, four drinks in you, you don't even know what that
*  experience is like. You don't have the wisdom and the knowledge and the history to go, okay,
*  I've got three drinks. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I should get out of here.
*  Yeah.
*  I definitely shouldn't be taking any pills.
*  Yeah. And so I'm already like trying to think about how I'm going to talk to my kids who are
*  younger. But like, you know, I hate to say it, it seems like marijuana, if you can smell the buds,
*  if you can see them, you know, there have been kind of some scaremongering on the internet and
*  certain police departments saying that there's been marijuana cut with fentanyl. But if you go
*  on snopes.com, they sort of debunk all that. So I think marijuana is, if you can smell it,
*  it smells like weed. You're probably pretty safe.
*  Well, there are a lot of people that are growing marijuana that are using pesticides and chemicals
*  that are dangerous. And there was one, what was the company that got caught recently, Jamie?
*  They tested their stuff.
*  Cushy Punch. I believe, yeah.
*  Say that again.
*  Cushy Punch. The microphone got fucked up.
*  Cushy Punch. We had a guy named John Norris on the podcast and he wrote a book called
*  Hidden in War. And he started off his career as a game warden, you know, investigating people
*  that caught too much fish, things along those lines. And he thought, hey, what a great job
*  this would be. I'm going to get a job in the great outdoors. I love the outdoors. And, you know,
*  I'll get to do some good for the wildlife. Well, turns out along the way, they started stumbling
*  upon these public land Mexican cartel grow operations where they would grow these marijuana
*  plants, just giant plots of them. And they would use these extremely toxic pesticides.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And also they would use poison to keep animals out. And they had vats of this shit laying around.
*  And some of the marijuana was actually infested with this shit or infected.
*  Yeah. My friend Amanda Chicago Lewis is this great journalist focused on marijuana. And
*  yeah, she put the fear of God in me about those pesticides and carcinogens. And the other thing
*  is just like these, you know, these different oils that people are smoking, some of them are marketed
*  as like all natural, but they find synthetic cannabinoids in them. And basically, you know,
*  synthetic cannabinoids like K2 and spice are what they're known as sometimes. And those are,
*  people call it synthetic marijuana, but the big difference is that THC is known as like a partial
*  agonist. So it will like these receptors, it will activate them to an extent, you're chilled,
*  it's relaxed. But the cannabinoids, they also interact with the cannabinoid receptors, same
*  as THC, but they're full agonists. And so they make you basically like go crazy. And your heart
*  starts beating fast, you start people overdose and die on these cannabinoids. And they, these are all
*  made in China too. I went into a lab in China where they made these and they made fentanyl analogs.
*  They let you in?
*  Yeah. I mean, it was a whole thing. I like wrote them on the internet. I made a fake email address
*  and I said, I'm a drug dealer. I'd like to visit your lab. May I do that when I come to China? And
*  they said, yeah.
*  What?
*  Yeah, that's like-
*  Did you have a fake drug dealer name?
*  I called myself, what did I call myself? I tried, I had this like Skype avatar picture where I looked
*  like a bro, like a 23 year old dude with like big hair, like kind of a stoner look. And they just,
*  they said, yeah, come by. And so, so I went to Shanghai and I met this guy at the train station
*  and he owned his own lab. And he asked me if I was a journalist actually, like pretty straight away.
*  He was like, are you a journalist though? And I was like, no, it's like, no crazy question.
*  Do I look like a journalist? No. And so he didn't, he didn't know whether to trust me.
*  So we went to his apartment. It was like the top floor of this fancy high rise. He's a total family
*  man. He had like lived there with his wife and kid.
*  A stranger brings a stranger to his home.
*  Yep. Yep.
*  Meets a guy who says he's a drug dealer, picks him up at the train station, says, hey,
*  come to where my kids sleep.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Wow.
*  And so then he showed me, because they have the website, a lot of these companies in China,
*  they make legitimate chemicals and recreational chemicals. And they specialize in drugs that are
*  legal in China, but banned in the West. So banned in the US.
*  What is illegal in China?
*  Well, in the US, we have this thing called the federal analog act. And so that bans all these
*  drugs even before they're invented. So anything that's similar to marijuana, structurally,
*  or in effect, anything that's similar to opioids, is just automatically banned,
*  automatically scheduled. But in China, they have to do it one by one by one by one. And so fentanyl
*  itself was scheduled in China, was banned in China decades ago. But these chemists,
*  like this one I met, specialize in this window when something is banned in the US,
*  but it's still legal in China, but it's become popularized on the internet.
*  So there's all these websites, these web forums, where these like drug nerds basically are like,
*  you can't get fentanyl, but you can get this thing that's kind of like fentanyl.
*  And that's a hilarious term, by the way, drug nerds.
*  Yeah, that's what they are. And like, psychonauts, I'm sure you've heard of psychonauts,
*  right? They specialize in these new, usually psychedelics, they tend to prefer,
*  that have never been tested on human subjects. But this guy was entirely specialized in
*  fentanyl analogs and synthetic cannabinoids. And so he took out, he had his fake list on his website
*  of all the legitimate, like Cialis and legitimate pharmaceuticals, things like that.
*  But at his apartment, he showed me the real list. And that had all these, it was cannabinoids,
*  fentanyl, it was like fake Valium, like different types of Xanax. And he showed me the prices,
*  and I was like, all right, looks good, can I go see your lab? And so finally, he decided he trusted
*  me. He called up his driver on the phone. And the driver showed up. And he was kind of this big,
*  like muscular dude who didn't speak any English. And I was a little worried. I was like, oh, this
*  is the dude who's gonna break my kneecaps if when he finds out I'm a journalist, you know, but I just
*  got in the car and we drove like 30 minutes to the outskirts of Shanghai. And we got to the lab and
*  it just looked like a regular office park, like a suburban office park. There was a fountain in
*  front of the building. There was like, you know, you use the key card to get in the parking lot.
*  And then it looked like kind of a new construction building. It smelled like cement.
*  We went inside. We went up to the lab, all the windows were open. It was the middle of the winter
*  and it was kind of a strong chemical smell. But it looked kind of just like Breaking Bad, like,
*  you know, like industrial size glassware, you know, beakers, bunsen burners,
*  all that stuff from high school chemistry. And he would point, he points up like,
*  basically, I had my recorder, you know, on my phone and I had it in my jacket pocket just on record.
*  And so he told me I couldn't take pictures. And so to take notes, I would just
*  say stuff aloud. I'd be like, oh, that's a light orange mixture that's being mixed up by a mechanical
*  arm. And you say it's benzophenanil, very interesting. But the language barrier was such
*  that he, you know, didn't think I was being too much of a weirdo. But clearly was. But the
*  cannabinoids were crazy. There was like a table like this, like almost exactly this size,
*  that was piled up with the cannabinoids that were there for drying. And it was, they were mounds like
*  this high, just sitting right out in the open. What did they look like? Does it look like pot?
*  No, because it's not a plant, you know, it's just basically, it's a chemical that's sprayed onto
*  like dried sage and stuff like that. So they try to make it look like pot and, you know,
*  you can smoke that stuff out of a pipe or even roll it into a joint. But if you look closely,
*  though, it's very clearly not pot. Wow. And so they're drying this stuff?
*  That's what I think. You know, they also had like drying machines. It looked like,
*  my editor didn't like it when I use this term, but you know, when you go into Subway
*  and there's the bread baking machines right there. It looked exactly like that.
*  Why did he not like that term? I don't know. I think he thought Subway would sue us or something.
*  But they had those and then they had like big buckets of one pound bags of these cannabinoids
*  and these fentanyl analogs just ready for shipping. He said they were sending them to Russia,
*  to Belgium, to the Netherlands. And then I think a lot of times it's repackaged there.
*  And so I don't know if you knew that the cannabinoids like used to be sold legally in
*  head shops like 10 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. And they would always be in these colorful packets.
*  They almost look like a Pop Rocks package. They say like spice and laugh out loud and stuff. And
*  so I think in Europe, that's where they do that. They put it in this colorful packaging
*  and then they ship it to the US. But yeah, he was saying that like
*  he kept like really close track of the law in all these countries, especially China. Like they're
*  scheduling this next week, so we're going to take all this and throw it away. And I thought at first
*  he was like probably just putting me on, but I think they actually do that. Like these guys are
*  businessmen first. They want to make money and going to follow the law, it just doesn't, you know,
*  it's not conducive. This is where bath salts came from, right? Exactly. Yeah. Bath salts tend to be
*  cathinones. So synthetic cathinones. Have you ever heard of the cat plant? K-H-A-T? Yeah. So the
*  hijackers, pirates in Somalia, they love to take that stuff. Yeah. It's really popular in the Middle
*  East. It's like it's a stimulant. It gets you really... Have you tried it? No, I never have. Yeah.
*  But I grew up in Minnesota though and there's a big Somali population and so there was a big
*  controversy in Minnesota whether or not to ban cat leaves from being sold in regular stores. Is it
*  legal? I think it is. I think it's not legal in the US now, if I'm not, but I don't know for sure.
*  Interesting. But so... It's K-H-A-T, is that...? Yeah, exactly. And so the synthetic cathinones
*  are the synthetic version of that, like made in a lab, but there's tons of different kinds.
*  You don't know how strong it is. And the bath salts, they... Of course, it has nothing to do
*  with like salts for your bath. This was a misnomer and they also wrote, called them like incense,
*  sometimes plant food. And on the back of all of them, it would say not intended for human consumption.
*  So that was like the way they got around, they thought they could get around the Federal Analog
*  Act because part of the law says that something is automatically illegal if it's intended for
*  human consumption. So these guys are like not intended for human consumption.
*  Just put it in your bath. Yeah. Your bath smells like fucking toxic chemicals.
*  Yeah. Do you remember when the homeless guy ate someone's face? Remember that? And they said he
*  was on bath salts? Yeah, but that was actually disproven. There was none found in his system.
*  He was just crazy. The causeway cannibal, I think they called him. Yeah. And he was just crazy,
*  right? I think he may have smoked some weed, but yeah, I don't think he had anything else in his
*  system. That was just high on life. Yeah. Oh man, Florida. The original Florida man.
*  Yeah. It's funny that one state is so synonymous with fuckery.
*  Yeah. And they also had this thing called Flakka. Have you ever heard of that?
*  Yes, I have, but I don't remember what it is. It's more cathinones. And if you look it up on
*  YouTube, there's all these people going crazy. That killed I think maybe 100 people in Florida
*  during a time. And the problem is the prohibition on drugs causes people to do really stupid things.
*  So you have this cathinone like Flakka. And as bad as that was, once they banned Flakka,
*  the chemists started manipulating the chemical structure. So they change one little thing. They
*  add like a chlorine group, for example. So like a chlorine molecule, it has nothing to do with the
*  drug, but they just add it on there to make it so it becomes legal. But then it becomes more
*  difficult for your body to digest it. So it becomes worse for you. And the high becomes worse. And then
*  they ban that. And then they make something new that's even worse for you. And it's just like
*  down the line. So that's what all these new drugs have in common. My book is about,
*  they're called NPS, novel psychoactive substances. So fentanyl is the most famous and the most
*  dangerous. But these include basically like synthetic new versions of every drug. So there's
*  marijuana, the NPS version is the synthetic cannabinoids. Heroin, the NPS version is fentanyl.
*  LSD. So you take LSD. It's like a wonder drug. No one has ever died of an LSD overdose. People may
*  have thought they were a bird or whatever and jumped off a roof, but no one has ever overdosed
*  on the drug itself. But once they started banning, once they started really cracking down on LSD,
*  these Chinese chemists started manufacturing this new type of psychedelic that was sold as acid.
*  And so if you went on the dark web, this was like in the like 10 years ago or so,
*  five, 10 years ago, you would search for acid and you would think you were buying LSD, but you're
*  buying this new psychedelic that could kill you and did kill you. These drugs are called N-bombs.
*  It's like the worst name of all time. These N-bomb drugs and they started killing people
*  in like the suburbs in Dallas. Oh, fail. And yeah.
*  Pete Slauson You really were a music editor.
*  Jared Liesveld Yeah. So these kids all thought they just wanted, they did their research. These
*  were like smart kids who said, oh, LSD has never killed anyone. Let's get that, this new thing,
*  and it killed them. And so it wasn't really LSD. It was just some –
*  Pete Slauson No, totally, no, nothing in common at all.
*  Jared Liesveld No relation at all.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jared Liesveld Now, the crazy thing is that this probably could be fixed with legalizing all drugs,
*  but nobody wants to legalize all drugs. It's such a catch-22 because like if you had heroin
*  available at the corner store, you would have no need to buy fentanyl. And if it was like at a
*  reasonable price where they couldn't undercut you, like, hey, heroin's five bucks, I'll send you
*  fentanyl for a dollar. It's a terrible thing to even say. I don't want people to be able to just
*  go buy meth. Pete Slauson
*  Yeah. Well, the way to think about it, I think, is like decriminalization a lot of times is like a
*  better alternative, in my opinion, in my, you know, my research, than legalization, right? So,
*  like, the presidential candidate Andrew Yang talks about decriminalizing opioids. And so,
*  when I first heard about that, I was like, what? I was like, that is a bridge too far.
*  But the more you think about it, it's like people get arrested for using fentanyl, they go to jail,
*  and then the recidivism rate is like through the roof. People like get out and they start using
*  again. They don't get the treatment they need, you know. And so, the opioid, you know, like,
*  people don't realize that fentanyl is killing more people than any drug in American history
*  ever on an annual basis. More than heroin, more than pills, more than meth, more than crack.
*  And so, things just get worse and worse every year. People aren't talking about it that much.
*  Pete Slauson But how is decriminalization going to stop
*  that? Because decriminalization will just make fentanyl more available. The point of legalizing
*  all drugs, and again, this is a very, very messy subject and I'm not a proponent of legalizing all
*  drugs. I'm sort of agnostic on it. I'm like, hmm, I don't know. I don't know what the fuck is it.
*  What is the answer? But if you legalize them and you can buy them from reputable sources,
*  you would know that you're actually buying cocaine. You're not buying some fake Chinese spice jam
*  thing, whatever the fuck they call it. You're buying actual cocaine. And you, look, we know
*  if you buy whiskey, right, you get a thing on the label that tells you what proof it is. You know
*  that if you have, you know, three drinks, you're going to be fucked up. And we can regulate that.
*  We could sort of adjust, like, I had two already. I'm good. You know? But if you don't know what's
*  in it, you don't know what the dose is. So, you don't know what you're okay with and what you're
*  not okay with. One of the good things about alcohol, like you get a beer, that's a beer.
*  You know what that is. You know how much alcohol is in there.
*  Yeah. Well, in some countries in Europe, they actually give free heroin to addicted users.
*  Yeah.
*  And so that, you know, it's often not the heroin that kills people at all. It's the dirty needles.
*  It's the criminal lifestyle used to, like, pay for the money to buy prostitution,
*  things like that. And so, I went and visited these places called supervised injection facilities.
*  Have you heard about these?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Where would these, where do they have them in this country?
*  Well, they don't have any in this country.
*  They wouldn't try to do something like that?
*  They're trying to do it in Philadelphia. Yeah. And there was a court case in its favor recently.
*  The former governor, Ed Rendell, is spearheading that. But I went to one in Barcelona. And so,
*  these are places where drug use is totally legal inside the facility. They have clean needles.
*  They have doctors and nurses supervise it. And they even like, so they have like,
*  this, the smoking room where you can go and do, do anything you want. They have crack pipes,
*  like, that the government provides. They're like government funded and created crack pipes
*  that they'll hand out to people. And they've never had an overdose death in one of these places.
*  They, they have, they're connected to treatment centers. They give out methadone, suboxone,
*  all these treatment drugs. It brings people into the system so that they're accounted for.
*  And these have been like super successful. But in the US, there's like federal crackdowns on them.
*  Yeah. I, again, it's, I think there's an issue politically, right? Because nobody wants to be
*  the one that says, hey, we're going to open up a place where people can come and shoot up.
*  Yeah.
*  And people are like, well, fuck this guy. My son's hooked on heroin. This piece of shit wants to help
*  him. What we need is detox centers. What we need is treatment. We don't need a place where you can
*  go and shoot heroin, you know, but like many things in life, this whole heroin thing, fentanyl thing,
*  all these different drugs, it's very messy. Yeah. Well, so even if you're not going to go that far,
*  there are simple steps we can take to help stop the opioid crisis. And one thing I'm a big advocate
*  for is called fentanyl testing strips. And so that's the weird thing about fentanyl is it's not a
*  demand driven drug. Like every other drug, it's out there because people want it. People want cocaine,
*  people want heroin, people don't want fentanyl.
*  They're sneaking it into other things.
*  Exactly. And so studies have shown that if users know fentanyl is in their cocaine or their meth
*  or their heroin or their pills, they will be much less likely to use it and overdose from it. And so
*  fentanyl testing strips, they look kind of like pregnancy tests. They're really cheap, just these
*  paper strips. You mix up your solution of whatever you think you have, heroin, and you dip the strip
*  in there. And if there's two stripes, that means that you have fentanyl. And if there's one, it
*  means you don't or else the other way around. And so it's simple, it's immediate. But again,
*  U.S. laws are so insane that these are actually banned in certain states like Pennsylvania.
*  So that could be done to help people understand that there's fentanyl in the drugs that they're
*  looking for. They're looking for cocaine, they're looking for heroin. Turns out there's
*  fentanyl in there. What other steps do you think can be taken to sort of alleviate or at least
*  somewhat mitigate this awful crisis?
*  Well, of course, there's Narcan. And you know what that is. It's the miracle opioid overdose
*  reversal drug. It's a nasal spray usually. And so if someone has overdosed on opioids, fentanyl,
*  heroin, pills, whatever, if you get these sprays, it will bring them back to life, literally.
*  And so that it's available in some places. Oh, man, I am not smart enough to know that.
*  I do not know how the chemical pathway works. Narcan. See if we can find out how Narcan works.
*  How does Narcan work? That's amazing, though, that they figured out something that can stop
*  people from in the middle of an overdose. I know. Like where else do we have that in life?
*  Pulp fiction. Remember with the needle to the heart? Remember that? Woo, what a scene.
*  You know what? I was asking someone about that recently and that is total bullshit. That is like
*  Quentin Tarantino just making something up. That's not a real thing. I'm glad he did.
*  It's a dramatic scene. It was fucking awesome. Yeah, it was pretty crazy. I mean, if you could
*  shove a fucking needle in the middle of your heart and pump that stuff in, like, wow, and she pops
*  up to life with a needle out of her chest. Yeah, that's in real life, it would have been a nasal
*  spray to the nose. Yeah. But this is 1994. They didn't have that. Yeah. And so nowadays, it's like
*  firefighters, librarians. These are the people who are encountering opioid overdose victims.
*  They're encountering them in the library. In the library. They come to the library to do drugs
*  or firefighters or EMTs react to people that are overdosing, right? Yeah. And isn't it the case that
*  some fentanyl overdoses, the people actually have it on their skin. So these people that are
*  helping them, whether they're police officers or first responders. That's actually another thing
*  that's kind of a Snopes.com thing. They started that. Yeah, no, that's, you can't get it from,
*  you can't get an overdose by touching fentanyl. It won't go into your skin. If someone like,
*  there was a, you know, amount of fentanyl and someone sneezed and it was in the air,
*  you could get it by breathing in, but by just touching it now. Oh, well, that's good to know.
*  This is the best explanation. Narcon reversing an overdose. It says, Narcon has a strong affinity
*  to the opiate receptors, a stronger affinity to the opiate receptors than opiates, opioids like
*  heroin or Percocet. So it knocks the opioids off the receptors for a short time. This allows the
*  person to breathe again and reverses the overdose. Holy shit. That person needs a Nobel prize.
*  Whoever came up with that. They need the exact opposite as the guy who sold the drugs to Prince.
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You know, they need love and respect. Yeah, that's an amazing discovery.
*  So that's good to know because we've actually, I think we probably repeated that. Someone told
*  me that. Did I ever repeat that on the show? That people have to wear drugs or gloves when
*  they're handling people with drug overdoses? I don't know. No, probably not. I probably saved
*  that jam. Have you ever heard of car fentanyl? What is that? It's a hundred times stronger than
*  fentanyl. It's an analog. It's used as like an elephant tranquilizer. And so in one of the
*  Jurassic Park movies, that's what they use to tranquilize the dinosaurs. Oh yeah, that's right.
*  And so I interviewed a bunch of dark web dealers for the book. I even actually like
*  met one in person. What did he look like? Well, he asked me not to say, but he was like a buff dude.
*  He was like a, he was like in his 30s. You're saying too much. You're saying too much. We're
*  going to find him now. Like when you were recording, like, oh, what is that orange vat of,
*  you know, did you do that kind of same shit when you're talking to him? No, no, because he knew I
*  was a journalist. I told him I was and he wanted to say, yeah, he just, he's like, people think of
*  us as scum, but I want to tell my story. And that's, that's what journalists like live on.
*  Right. What is his story? Well, he was a, he's probably listening to this man. Hey bro. That's
*  crazy. He was a total family man with his daughter. He was like feeding her French fries and stuff,
*  but he had, he was addicted to meth at one point. He had a lot of sort of depression,
*  self-esteem issues, but then he tried the opioids and he said it was like an antidepressant.
*  You know, so he became hooked. And so he started selling fentanyl on the dark web because it,
*  he didn't want his kids to have to live in poverty. He didn't want to, his drug addiction
*  to interfere. And so not only that, but he, he claims that he's helping addicted users more
*  affordably maintain their habits. So he has this big like fuck, you know, Purdue Pharma anti-government,
*  anti big Pharma mentality. So he blames like Purdue Pharma made Oxycontin pills and got,
*  that's how the whole opioid epidemic began. So it was first, it was the pills, then people switched
*  to heroin and now it's fentanyl is in all the heroin. And so this guy says that because he
*  makes a nasal spray too. And he says that people can buy his fentanyl nasal spray on the dark web
*  for like 60 bucks, take one spray, it's equivalent to one Oxycontin pill. And that's enough to
*  maintain their addiction. And so he says, you know, instead of paying money to the big
*  pharmaceutical companies, people buy this, it's much cheaper. And so he had a whole moral
*  justification of how he did it. So he's an ethical drug pusher. That's, that was his case.
*  The problem is that this stuff, fentanyl is so potent and to make it into a nasal spray,
*  you have to use this whole thing. It's called volumetric dosing with the water. And you got
*  to get the exact right proportions. And he's not a trained pharmacist. You know, so he's buying it.
*  He's a middleman. No, no, no, he does it. He has a whole process how he does it. Yeah. But he's not
*  a trained pharmacist. He doesn't, you know, he's doing it right. That it wasn't. So I told him
*  that I said that to him and he's like, well, basically I tested on myself. So if I'm doing
*  it wrong, I would die. So my customers therefore know I've tried it. So that guy sounds like he's
*  got a great pitch, but I'm not sure. Yeah. I mean, you got to justify. Yeah, I get it. But
*  so many people who sell drugs and so many people who are involved in drugs, they're always,
*  people have fucked up lives like to paint the best version of what they're doing. Yeah. That's
*  what that sounds like. Yeah. I mean, I feel like if you're selling fentanyl, someone's probably died
*  because of what you sold them. I mean, it's just, it's one of those things where it's so deadly.
*  I mean, what are the numbers in terms of annual deaths from fentanyl in the United States?
*  Well, it's up over 30,000 a year and that's, that's more than, that's more than the peak of the AIDS
*  crisis. Think about that while people are trying to ban flavored vapes, which is fucking preposterous.
*  You know, it's, it's terrifying. 30,000 people. God damn. That is so many. That's a lot of people.
*  There's many, many, many, many people listening to this that know someone who's been affected by
*  this. That's the horrific thing is it's, and it's sort of snuck up on us where it's, this is not a
*  big thing in the news. You don't hear about fentanyl deaths in the news. You would think that
*  if there was like a Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid was killing 30,000 people a year. Holy shit.
*  If Kool-Aid was killing two people a year. Yeah. Yeah. But the fact that this fentanyl stuff and
*  it's all happening because it's illegal, it's all happening in this sort of weird gray area.
*  It's, you know, a lot of people in the margins. It's, I want to hear the presidential candidates
*  talking about it. You know, like there's so little at the Democrat debate, they were asked like,
*  what would you do about the fentanyl crisis, the opioid crisis? And they all said basically,
*  we got to sue the pharmaceutical companies like Purdue Pharma. Now I have sympathy for that
*  argument. I mean, Purdue Pharma and places like Malancrot Pharmaceuticals, no one's heard of that.
*  They're from St. Louis where I'm from. They actually made a ton more pills. They made like 29
*  billion pills a year, opioid pills at the height of the opioid crisis. So these companies, and they
*  made jokes about it. There were these emails that were found that people were like, it's almost like
*  people are addicted to these pills, you know, like it's just like Doritos. If you keep eating them,
*  we'll make more. They were joking around. They were making jokes about that. While people were
*  dying. While people were dying. So I have total sympathy that these, we should sue these companies
*  just like the big tobacco lawsuits in the 90s. The money will go towards care, treatment,
*  all that. But that does nothing to stop the fentanyl crisis. The pill deaths are already
*  starting to drop, which is great. Heroin deaths are starting to drop, which is great. But fentanyl
*  deaths are still rising. And besides, you know, this guy Andrew Yang, who I said the candidate with
*  he talks, he has a lot of good solutions. You know, Elizabeth Warren has some good ideas in
*  her proposal, wants to put more money. But for the most part, like these should be the Democrats
*  people, you know what I mean? People on the margins, but they're like barely talking about it at all.
*  I think it's one of those things where just being president, right? Being president is an impossible
*  job. There's no way one person can really control every single aspect of our civilization. It's just
*  not possible. And I think that's the same thing about running for president. No person running for
*  president really can address every single issue that this nation is dealing with. So they stick
*  with the big ones like jobs and, you know, inequality and all the things that are just going to get
*  people to push the button. Yeah, they get into the booth. I mean, that's all they're doing. This is
*  just a, I hope you like me, sort of pitch, you know? Yeah, I mean, you know, it's killing more
*  people than car accidents, more than guns even. Did you know that? Fentanyl kills more people than
*  guns. Makes sense. But what kills me is I just don't see a logical first step where someone can
*  do something about, I mean, other than legalization of drugs. And this is also the step,
*  I'm sure you probably heard what happened in Northern Mexico yesterday. Yesterday? No. It was
*  not with El Chapo's son, was it? No, no, it was a new one. A family, a woman and her children were
*  gunned down, a Mormon woman. They, you know, they have these Mormon compounds in Northern Mexico.
*  Oh no, I didn't know that. And 10 people were murdered, women and children by cartels. Oh really?
*  Jeez. And just gunned them down. Then more people were injured, 10 people, a little kid, a little
*  girl was shot in the back and she's in a hospital. It's like, they just gun these people down. And
*  this is all just this inhuman violence from the cartels and the cartels that have
*  rose to power and prominence because of the fact that there's an illegal drug trade. So there's
*  money to be made. So instead of that money being made by pharmaceutical companies, that money's
*  being made by these ruthless murderers, cartels. And this is exactly what happened during
*  prohibition in the United States. When they made alcohol illegal in the 1920s, was it the 30s? What
*  was it? 20s? I think it was the 20s. 20s, yeah. When they made alcohol illegal, it didn't stop
*  people from drinking. It just made people sell it illegally. Yeah. And so organized crime rose
*  and then Al Capone and all these different organized crime members, they made insane
*  amounts of money and developed insane amounts of power. And we're seeing the exact same thing
*  happening in Mexico. And again, alcohol is simple, right? Yeah, make it legal. We're adults.
*  It's not this, the pills are not simple, right? It's a scary one. It's scary.
*  Well, the war on drugs stuff, it's increasingly going to be turned towards China. And in fact,
*  Trump has been meeting with the Chinese president and all the trade war stuff, the increasing the
*  tariffs, this is now tied into fentanyl. And so supposedly in a couple of days, this might be out
*  by then, but there's this announcement of a new partnership. China says they're finally going to
*  crack down on these drug labs. And we'll see if it happens. But the point is like, we can do
*  everything we want to try to, you know, we can go to war with China over this issue. But, you know,
*  what is our past record in this realm? Like the DEA helped kill Pablo Escobar, right? But since then,
*  there's more cocaine coming out of Colombia than there ever was before. You know, nowadays,
*  El Chapo was arrested, tried, that's doing nothing to stop the drugs, the cartels,
*  drugs coming into the US. And there's every indication that if we do get China to stop this
*  insane, like 90% or more of the illicit fentanyl comes from China, that if we do get them to crack
*  down on it, the industry is going to go to India. And India is already starting to see these huge
*  busts. Like there's these Mexican cartel members getting busted in India for buying fentanyl.
*  Jared Ranere In India.
*  David Kramer Yeah, the thing is like, China and India have the two biggest chemical industries
*  when it comes to generics, kind of lower level chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The US has the
*  most profitable pharmaceutical industry because we make like the brand name drugs, things like that.
*  But when you're talking about generics and stuff like vitamin C, acetaminophen, which is the drug
*  in Tylenol, these are all made in China, a place like India. And so, they have this huge kind of
*  brain trust of chemists. You know, people go to university, they learn how to be chemists, and then
*  a certain amount of them get into the illicit industry, right? So, Mexico doesn't have that.
*  Mexico doesn't have its own chemical industry and a bunch of scientists who can make fentanyl,
*  who can make these new drugs. So, that makes India so susceptible to it. And the biggest problem
*  is actually not even the fentanyl itself. It's the fentanyl precursors. And do you know what
*  those are?
*  Pete Slauson Yes, the chemicals that are used to make fentanyl.
*  David Kramer Exactly. And so, that was sort of the main investigation in my book. Like,
*  almost like 80 pages of the book are dedicated to this one company. They're called Yuan Cheng,
*  this Chinese company that makes more fentanyl precursors than any company in the world.
*  You know, they, they're legit. And not only that, they sell them to the Mexican cartels
*  and they're totally sanctioned, not only sanctioned by the Chinese government,
*  but they get tax breaks from the Chinese government. They get subsidies, they get their
*  land subsidized, their staff training, things like that. And that was sort of the most
*  jaw-dropping revelation that I had was that the Chinese government is not only failing to crack
*  down, but they're encouraging this industry.
*  Pete Slauson Wow. They're encouraging the industry. That's insane. So, it's just, the idea is,
*  look, it's making a lot of money. Let's just keep making money.
*  David Kramer Yeah. It's, a lot of people ask me if they think this is a blatant conspiracy
*  to try to like inflict harm upon the US, a subversive form of warfare. And so,
*  I think it didn't start out that way. I think that these, these benefits were given so that
*  China could increase its exports, could grow its economy, particularly when it comes to chemical
*  exports. So, that's why these tax credits started. They're called value-added tax rebates.
*  And so, what that means is any chemical that you use to, to, any ingredients you use to make a
*  chemical for exports, you can write off the cost of those, of those ingredients when you export it.
*  So, basically, it's like a 16% tax rebate. And so, they originally did that just to try to like
*  improve their economy, improve their exports. But what's crazy to me now is that last year
*  in the middle of the trade war, this was at the height of when you heard about the trade war every
*  day. You know, Trump was raising tariffs and doing this and that. Right at the height of that,
*  China increased the tax rebate for fentanyl from 9% to 10%. So, it was almost like a,
*  seemed like a thumb in the eye. Like, for fentanyl. It's, I don't know.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it definitely seems like a big fuck you.
*  Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Wow. This is what's crazy about this, is that what you said before,
*  no one running for president is talking about it. The president has talked about it briefly,
*  you know, but it's not, I don't see any movement. I don't see any big steps being taken.
*  I mean, I don't know what big movements could be taken. I mean, how do you eradicate this stuff?
*  Well, have you heard of medication assisted treatment? This is like what I was talking
*  about, Suboxone, Methadone, and there are these opioid blockers too. So, there are all these drugs
*  for low level, you know, low level opioids. So, you take your daily Suboxone shot and you don't
*  crave fentanyl, you don't crave heroin anymore. But it can't just be the drugs, you know, you see
*  in TV shows or whatever, just this line of people and, you know, they go back out on the street and
*  then they're, you know, get back to whatever they were doing. But medication assisted treatment
*  combines that with traditional counseling and therapy because a lot of times it's not just,
*  it's not just chemical hooks, you know what I mean? It's people's lives, they have problems,
*  they're like out of work, they got terrible family problems, they have trauma in their past.
*  And if you can, you know, unravel those problems, really get to the heart of things,
*  people can quit and they do it all the time.
*  There's another method that is not widely discussed, but it's incredibly effective,
*  and that's Ibogaine.
*  I've heard about that, yeah.
*  Well, I know many people that have kicked pills because of Ibogaine, kicked booze,
*  kicked destructive, self-destructive habits because of it.
*  Is it a root or something?
*  It's a plant from Africa, I believe. It's from the Iboga plant. And I believe it's,
*  see if that's from Africa. I don't want to be wrong about this. It's legal in Mexico. And
*  a friend of mine, my friend Ed Clay, went down to Mexico because he had an issue with pills,
*  he hurt himself.
*  Oh really?
*  Got on pills, really fucking up his life, went down there, got treatment, was so stunned by it
*  he opened up his own place down there to try to help people.
*  Oh really? Wow. What part of Mexico?
*  So Ibogaine, I don't know, it's a substance derived from the plant, yeah, African shrub called
*  Tabernate, is that right? Tabernate? Iboga, which is known for its psychedelic qualities
*  and used in African spiritual ceremonies. Some claim it's something of a miracle cure
*  for opiate addiction with minimal withdrawal symptoms. There's something that happens with
*  Ibogaine when you take it, that it does something to rewire the areas of the brain that
*  respond to opiates and that sort of are hardwired for addiction. It rewires them in a way that
*  they have a very low recidivism rate, very low, you know, repeat addiction rate.
*  Yeah, like psychedelics seems to be so much potential. There's this professor that I
*  write about, his name is David Nichols, and he basically spent his whole career studying
*  psychedelics as a way to help people beat cocaine addictions, alcohol addictions,
*  even fight things like PTSD. And it was actually found that MDMA, ecstasy, is like this amazing
*  drug for PTSD. Yeah, I've heard this. The MAPS is in the middle of-
*  Exactly. Yeah, they're doing these, they finally have gotten clearance to do these studies.
*  And in some cases, just using MDMA one time is enough. And the term you used, it rewires
*  the brain. It's like resetting the hard drive or like turning the computer off, turning it back on
*  again. Yes. And I think it also changes the way people think about drugs, because these are not
*  escape drugs in the same sense as heroin is or fentanyl is or cocaine is. These are drugs that
*  sort of just give you a refocused perspective on reality itself. Yeah. And I don't need to
*  tell you about DMT. Yeah. Yeah. It's another one. It's the same, but I mean, that's also,
*  ayahuasca is also very successful for people to quit smoking, using it to quit alcohol,
*  people that have real issues. It sort of gets to the heart. It lets you understand, like, hey,
*  we're going to take you on a little journey into the mind and show you through dimethyltryptamine,
*  show you what's fucking with you. Right. This is something that you've sort of stored away
*  in the back of your brain. Right. It's rotten. You're always ignoring it, but it's always there. So
*  it flavors everything you do. Right. And psychedelics, one of the things that they do is they shine a
*  bright light on all of those weird parts of the mind that we all have. We all have weird memories
*  or weird feelings or weird thoughts of inadequacy or self-hate, whatever it is that cause us to be
*  self-destructive and make poor choices. And a lot of times we're not even aware of it. These things
*  sort of fester in your subconscious. And DMT, psilocybin, a lot of different psychedelic drugs,
*  which oddly enough, the most potent ones, they mirror normal human neurochemistry.
*  Oh, that's amazing. Which DMT is a part of normal human neurochemistry. It's produced by the human body.
*  I've heard that. And I've heard that, like, ayahuasca, you know, ayahuasca is like 12 hours
*  or whatever experience. It's a long experience, yeah. And I've heard that DMT is basically the
*  very peak of that, like distilled down. Yeah. The way I describe it is mushrooms
*  times a million plus aliens. Did it have like a profound lasting impact on you?
*  Oh, yeah. It changes who you are. You're pre that thing and then you are now you know.
*  Now you know that there's a whole other dimension to understanding and to experience. It's just
*  it's very, very, very different than the normal static world that we all live in.
*  Yeah, there's this guy called Sasha Shulgin. Yeah, you know, Sasha Shulgin. So I got to go to the
*  farm where he designed all his drugs. And, you know, he dedicated his whole career to trying to,
*  you know, discover new psychedelics that could be used as medicine. And so he took like the
*  chemical structure of mescaline was one of his most often used, they're called the scaffolding
*  effect. So it's like that's the chemical scaffolding. And so he would tweak little
*  bits to try to come up with new drugs, sample tiny bit himself. If it did nothing, took a little more,
*  little more, little more till it till it had an effect. And he invented over 100 new drugs.
*  He was working for Dow Chemical. The people invented Agent Orange at the start of his career.
*  And he invented like psychedelics while working there that have like the Dow, you know, Dow was
*  like patent patented. And so he invented this drug that was known as STP is a psychedelic,
*  it stood for serenity, tranquility and peace, I think. And so this is like a hippie era drug.
*  And there was the Hell's Angels actually got into selling it and distributing it. It was a,
*  it was this this crazy story. But they but the problem was the Hell's Angels got the dosage
*  wrong. So they gave everybody way too much. And there was this big, this big protest in
*  Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, in San Francisco, it was called the human being.
*  And they were protesting the banning of LSD that year was 1967. And so everybody went to the Golden
*  Gate Park, took this stuff, this STP and this really high dosages. And they all like, they all
*  like freaked out and ended up in the hospital. And so what's it made out of? I don't know. It's
*  it's it's some kind of not related LSD. Is it available now? I'm sure it is. Yeah, in the dark
*  web, you can I'm sure you could get it. Yeah. I don't know. It doesn't sound that great. Even
*  in its regular proper dose, Sasha Shulgin has those books called PCAL and T-Cal,
*  which are basically cookbooks and how to make all the psychedelics. And even he like wasn't that
*  crazy about this one. But but anyway, after all these people in Golden Gate Park started freaking
*  out and Dow Chemical realized that it was their guy doing this, they're like, all right, all right,
*  that's enough. Shut them down. Yeah. Have you ever heard of Hamilton Morris? Yeah, yeah, he's great.
*  Hamilton's pharmacopoeia. He's great. I've seen him on here. Yeah, he's the most knowledgeable
*  person that I know in terms of these things. And he interviewed Sasha before he died. He loves
*  Sasha. Yeah, he did. Yeah. He's he takes a scientific but yet a connoisseur's approach
*  to drugs. I mean, he's very scientific about like the what's happening. Yeah. But yet, you know,
*  talk about it like the way Somal Yadav discusses a fine wine. Yeah, I remember he's talking about
*  he took a cannabinoid and he's like, it's my crown chakra is feeling. Yeah, he's hilarious when he's
*  blitzed on that show, Hamilton's pharmacopoeia. And you know, his dad, right? Yes. Yeah, it's
*  amazing. Earl Morris is such an amazing documentarian. Yes. Yeah. We did a podcast,
*  we've done two, but the first one we did, we got way too high. We were useless. I remember you guys
*  talking about that. Yeah. I mean, we were useless. It's like, hey, Hamilton Morris is on the show.
*  That was the early days of the podcast, too. The early days of the podcast, we often got way too
*  high. Yeah, I had to figure out how to dial it in. Yeah. That's the number one thing people asked me
*  when I said I was going on this show. They're like, I can get high with Joe. Like, I would be so
*  useless and in part no information. And, and plus, it's like the opioid epidemic, I got to like,
*  get my facts right. Well, it doesn't seem like appropriate time to get fucked up. Yeah. Yeah.
*  What are you trying to do with this book? Besides let people know the history of fentanyl,
*  do you feel like with education, you can do some good because people will be armed with
*  facts and understanding and they can make better choices? Yeah, all the above. The government,
*  all branches of the US government have been reaching out to me about this book.
*  That's great. That's good to hear. Yeah. People want it, like this China stuff. Nobody knew
*  anything about what China was doing and why. And so I'm, you know, like the left and the right,
*  I sort of like this book, which is a rare consensus because the right wing is really into like China is
*  fucking with us. And the left wing is really into this, this idea of harm reduction. And that's my
*  big sort of talking point is like the war on drugs stuff is I always compare it to sex education,
*  right? I mean, we can teach abstinence, believe that kids aren't going to have sex, stick our
*  heads in the sand, or we can do understand kids are always going to have sex, kids are always
*  going to take drugs. Let's try to help them do it more safely. Right. And so, you know, if I,
*  I've been in rooms where it was like hardcore law and order Republicans, and I just try to like,
*  make my point, like, you know, we can keep doing things the way we have, we're failing miserably.
*  Why not give these other methods a chance? You know, and a lot of times they have a proven
*  track record of success in places like Europe, like, what are we waiting for?
*  Yeah, we have this Puritan ideal, you know, this the abstinence ideal, and then we apply that to
*  drugs. And I just think it's so foolish. It really is. And I, and it, it's also so politically
*  dangerous to say anything other than that. Yeah. I think it's, you know, the good news is like the
*  optimistic thing is that that's slowly changing, you know, and a lot of people say, well, during
*  the crack era, there's a lot of racism, people say like during the crack era, it was all about like,
*  lock these people up, you know, criminalize the users. But now that it's like the white
*  politicians kids who are dying from opioids. Now all of a sudden, this is a, this is a health
*  problem. And this is something we need to address as a disease, you know, and so that's there's no
*  doubt that that's true. But at the same time, the positive is that like, this is spilling into other
*  realms too. So I went to North Dakota, this small town Grand Forks, where this 18 year old kid
*  overdosed and died on fentanyl. And it just shocked the town. Everyone freaked out, but it inspired
*  all these new reforms. So now they have all these new laws in North Dakota, like things like the
*  good Samaritan law, where if someone is with you and they die from drugs, you can call the police
*  and they won't arrest you. You know what I mean? Because that happens in a lot of places still.
*  If you know, they blame the person who they're with. And they have things like they can use Skype,
*  like a Skype type service when they live in these small rural towns to get a prescription from a
*  doctor far away. They can use these services. And what they told me in Grand Forks is that
*  this system is spilling over to other, even like alcoholism now, people are starting to think of
*  that as a disease. And so I think there is slow progress being made.
*  Pete Well, that's good to hear. I mean, it just takes time, right, for people to understand that
*  this is a real issue that's affecting everyone. I think you're right about the racism in terms of
*  like the attitude about crack versus cocaine. And that could clearly be demonstrated by sentencing.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  People were sentenced, the mandatory minimums for crack use were so much higher. When people got
*  caught with crack or selling crack, I mean, they went to jail for a long fucking time. Whereas
*  people got caught with cocaine, they didn't go to jail for as long. And the treatment,
*  the sentence is much smaller. And Dr. Carl Hart, you know, he's great as well. I've had him on here.
*  And he was explaining, he's like, look, there is no difference. He's like, it is cocaine. I mean,
*  this is cocaine. You want to break it down to the drug effect on the body. They are the same thing.
*  And one of them sends you away for a long time, one of them doesn't.
*  Pete Yeah. Well, for my book about West Coast hip hop called Original Gangsters,
*  I interviewed Freeway Ricky Ross. Has he been on here?
*  Pete Yeah. Yes, a couple times.
*  Pete Yeah. So he –
*  Pete The original Rick Ross.
*  Pete The original Rick Ross.
*  Pete The real Rick Ross.
*  Pete Yeah, the real Rick Ross, exactly. And his sort of the innovation of their era
*  was what was called Ready Rock. And so, before people would, people preferred to smoke cocaine,
*  even before crack was invented.
*  Pete Freebase.
*  Pete That was –
*  Pete Right, exactly.
*  Pete Richard Pryor got in trouble with.
*  Pete Yeah, exactly. So, the innovation was to make it so you didn't have to freebase. It was ready
*  to smoke. So, they called it Ready Rock. And Eazy E's first record label, his record label was called
*  Ruthless. But they were going to call it Rock House Records, you know, for that reason. And so,
*  he was a crack dealer before he got in the music industry.
*  Pete Yeah. The Rick Ross story is – the real Rick Ross story, I should say.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete Rick Ross, Freeway Ricky, which is what they used to call him, was making millions and millions
*  of dollars. Did not have any idea that he was involved in that whole Oliver North –
*  Pete The Iron Man's Conscious Scandal, yeah.
*  Pete Which is incredible. They were using the cocaine money to fund the war without the
*  consciousness of the Sandinistas.
*  Pete Yeah. Yeah, Rick Ross is – I wrote about him and so, I ended up actually playing tennis
*  with him because I –
*  Pete He's a really good tennis player.
*  Pete Yeah, I heard he was – and I was a big high school tennis player too. So, I was like,
*  let's do this. And he's, you know, he's got some years on me. I don't know how old he is. I think
*  he's maybe late 50s. But he was holding his own. We played on like a south central tennis court
*  somewhere and he took some games off me, definitely.
*  Pete Well, his story is incredible because they sent him away on the three strikes rule for life.
*  And then while he was in jail, he learned how to read.
*  Pete Oh.
*  Pete Then he learned how to understand the law and he started, like literally,
*  taught himself to be a lawyer and then realized like, no, the way they used the law was
*  incorrect and unlawful. They – three strikes means you get arrested for larceny. You get out,
*  you get arrested for larceny. You get out, you get arrested for larceny. They did it in one swoop.
*  So, they gave him two charges at the same time and then put him in for three strikes. And he was able
*  to successfully prove that that was wrong. That's why he's out right now.
*  Pete Wow. He's so smart. One of the things he taught me that, you know, you guys used to hear
*  about crack babies all the time and the 80s like cover of Newsweek crack babies. He was like, you
*  know, crack babies aren't real. That's not a real thing. He said that his – I believe, I hope I'm
*  not speaking out of school, I think like his wife, like maybe smoked crack while his son was in utero
*  and never had any problems. And he's like, yeah, look around. Do your research. Like crack babies
*  is not a real thing.
*  Pete That's crazy because I remember hearing that as well. Like crack babies was a thing
*  we were all worried about in the 80s. Oh my God, wait till the year 2000. All these crack babies
*  are 20 years old.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete That was the thing.
*  Pete Where are they now? Yeah.
*  Where are they now? Maybe they're mumble rappers. Maybe that's what's going on.
*  Pete Oh, I shouldn't laugh at that.
*  Pete You did though. Because you understand real rap music.
*  Pete Oh, man. I'm just worried that I'm becoming like that.
*  Pete You wrote about real hip hop. You're not the old man, right?
*  Pete I know. It's just so lame to be like the kids these days.
*  Pete I'm definitely that. That's who I am. Yeah. I'm embracing it.
*  Pete Are you into hip hop? I was just asking someone. Okay. Who is your kind of generation?
*  Pete Nas, huge Nas fan. Gang star. Love gang star. Of course, Biggie, Tupac,
*  the classics. Big Daddy Kane. I love EPMD.
*  Pete Yeah. That's old school East Coast stuff.
*  Pete Yeah. God, there's so many. It's just that era. It was like, I mean, there's a couple eras
*  that I just listed, but it's lyrical. Like Nas is my favorite, I think.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete Because his lyrics, they're so intricate, you know, the way he words things. Like you just go,
*  oh shit! You hear his lyrics, you just go, oh!
*  Pete Nas is like the king of, he's like the oh shit king.
*  Pete Yeah. For lyrics, man. He's the best. What was the, was it Rewind? What was the one where
*  he played the whole song backwards? Like from the bullet going back into the gun all the way through
*  the entire story, he starts at the end and then backs up the story. Maybe he had some fucking
*  classics. I think he's the best writer in all of hip hop.
*  Pete Yeah. Well, you know, it's just his beats don't always hit me the right way,
*  but he's got so many classics, he's earned like the right. But my big thing, because I did live
*  in New York and I was in East Coast, you know, like music snob and like Biggie is clearly the
*  best ever.
*  Pete I got one for you. Let me find out if you're real. Cool G rap.
*  Pete Oh yeah, he's the, I mean, he's the original, he's the best.
*  Pete Undisputed.
*  Pete Undisputed underground guy, like people don't know. Like you list like some of the greats of
*  all time, people don't say Cool G rap. Go back and listen to Cock Blockin'. That is one of the best
*  fucking songs ever. To this day, I'll go listen to that song and it'll make me laugh.
*  Yeah. That was, yeah, I mean, that like 80s New York stuff is so, so much of it.
*  Pete Hill street blues.
*  Pete So, like, so intellectual, so amazing wordplay.
*  Pete Yes.
*  Pete But see, when I came to LA though, everyone's like Tupac, Tupac, Tupac. And I was like, I don't
*  get it, man. His flow is not that great. You know, I just don't get it. But the more I like
*  listen to his lyrics, the more I saw he was more than just a rapper. He was like a cultural
*  influence. He was like a political leader to a lot of people. And finally, I'm like, yes, I get it.
*  He stood for something. And now, like, I just don't hear Biggie the same way, you know,
*  because so many of his songs are about, you know, partying and crime and stuff. And
*  the bigger message of Tupac just really won me over and then.
*  Pete Well, I don't think it's a competition, but I know what you're saying. I mean,
*  Tupac definitely had a different vision. But Biggie, you also have to realize Biggie was like,
*  how old was he when he died?
*  Pete Oh, yeah. They both were.
*  Pete 24 or something?
*  Pete Yeah. Yeah. Tupac was 25.
*  Pete One of my favorite videos of Biggie is Biggie standing on a street corner
*  when he was like 16, 17 years old rapping. Do you ever see that?
*  Pete I think I have.
*  Pete Oh, Jesus.
*  Pete With the lumberjack stuff.
*  Pete Yeah. He's got a fucking, I think he might even have a piece of paper in his hand.
*  Pete Uh huh.
*  Pete Where he's like reading the rap off or he's got it like in case he fucks up.
*  But his flow was so good, even as a little kid. He was a fucking kid, man. And he's like,
*  as good as any rapper alive. Can you find that? Can we play that? We'll get in trouble? I'll play
*  it for you afterwards. After the podcast, we'll play it.
*  Pete And his breath control and like his weight. Sometimes I feel like you got to be like fat
*  almost to be an amazing singer or rapper.
*  Pete Well, comedians too. A lot of fat comedians like Patrice O'Neill,
*  one of the greatest of all time. There was something about his girth when he was on stage.
*  He had like power in the, like this whole thing. Here's Biggie.
*  Pete Oh, yeah. I've seen this. That's amazing.
*  Pete Summer. He's so small.
*  Pete Oh, it might be a towel. Oh, yeah, you're right. 17 years old in Bed-Stuy.
*  Pete Yeah.
*  Pete And just murdering it. Murdering it. Everybody around him. Now look at everybody.
*  Pete You know, I saw this early Tupac videos and heard early Tupac recordings
*  and his original style influence was actually Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
*  Pete Yes. Remember when he was a dancer for Humpty Hump?
*  Pete Yeah, Digital Underground.
*  Pete Yeah. He was like in the background of the Humpty Hump dance.
*  Pete Yeah. No, Tupac was a dancer. I mean, and when he was young, which is really interesting
*  when they interview him, he was like, he wasn't thugged out at all.
*  Pete Well, he's the son of two Black Panthers, you know. The politics was always his thing.
*  Pete What is that from?
*  Pete That was his like solo debut.
*  Pete Wow. Yeah, Digital Underground. Whatever happened to them?
*  Pete Humpty Hump, Shock G, he's still around. He's –
*  Pete They were so good. They had great shit.
*  Pete When you write a song that's as profitable as the Humpty dance, I would imagine it kind of
*  saps your need to do too much else when you're that set. But no, he has though. He's the real deal.
*  Pete There was a lot of great hip hop in that era. I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of great hip hop
*  now, but to me, it's almost like I'm a classic rock fan as well. If I'm sitting there and I'm
*  about to go for a drive and I'm like, what do I listen to? Nine times out of ten, I'll go to
*  Leonard Skinner or Zeppelin or The Doors or, you know, the Almond Brothers.
*  Pete What about Tom Petty?
*  Pete Love Tom Petty. I just go to those classics for whatever reason.
*  There's so much music. I know there's great stuff out now. I still listen to some great stuff now.
*  I love the Black Keys. I love them. They're still putting out killer shit.
*  Pete The Vampire Weekend album is amazing. I don't know if you've heard that.
*  Pete What's that?
*  Vampire Weekend, they're from New York. It's a band. The lead singer, Ezra Koenig, is with,
*  what's her name, Jones from Parks and Recreation. Rashida Jones.
*  Pete New band?
*  Pete They're not that new, but –
*  Pete Vampire Weekend?
*  Pete They're fucking amazing. Lana Del Rey's album.
*  Pete There's some great shit out there, no doubt. But it's just, it's almost like there's too much.
*  There's like –
*  Pete But that's what's great about music. I mean, it's an untapped,
*  like, it's a well that never runs dry. And that's what, I always go back to it.
*  Pete Well, it's interesting to me too that much of, I mean, it's weird when we talk about drugs,
*  because drugs seem like a blanket expression that you can throw over things that are good and bad.
*  Things that are productive, like caffeine, and things that are terrible, like meth. But there's
*  a lot of music that you would say is like, oh, well, what the fuck happened between 1960 and 1970?
*  Because something happened. You go to the music of 1960, and then you go to the music of 1970.
*  You go to the music of 2009 and 2019, they're fucking the same, man. It's like, there's great
*  stuff. There's a lot of variety, but there's no like, what the fuck happened? But from 1960 to
*  1969, what the fuck happened? Something happened, and that something is drugs.
*  Pete That's, you know, it's like the whole societal shift went right along with it. They
*  kind of fueled each other. The psychedelics, absolutely. I guess that dirt weed they were
*  smoking probably affected them too.
*  Pete Well, they smoked so much of it, it became effective. But you know, I've talked to some
*  people and they said there was always some good weed back then. They'd call it Acapulco Gold or
*  whatever. But there was no botanists, some fucking scientists that are working on some of the weed
*  that you have today, which is 40 plus percent THC, mind numbing, you know, you can't feel your feet,
*  you know, that kind of stuff. I don't think they had any of that. Keef and wax.
*  Jared And the stuff, like I just came back to LA for the first time recently, went into a legal
*  weed store for the first time. I didn't buy anything. But the dosages are so high, you know,
*  all of them. Like, why, there's got to be a connoisseur's market for like microdosing of
*  weed. Like, where's that?
*  Pete Well, what you want to get is those CBD THC tablets.
*  Jared Oh, I heard about that.
*  Pete They're capsules and it's 10 milligrams. 10 milligrams THC, 10 milligrams CBD. And it's so
*  nice. It's just a nice calm mellow high. Like, you just like appreciate things a little bit more.
*  The colors are a little bit vibrant. But you can just walk around and talk to people. You don't,
*  you're not like, fuck, I gotta go home and get under the covers quick. It's not, you know,
*  but the thing is, there's so many like hardcore stoners today that they need those high doses
*  because their tolerance is so high. And they're just trying to melt their face off. Like, every
*  time they go in there, they're trying to find some new thing that melts their face off harder.
*  Jared I just like, I don't know, man, psychedelics, like LSD,
*  you know, I'm like going in the other direction, really. Like, we went vegan, you know, like not
*  smoking weed, really not like drinking much. It's just like exercising, eating like the best food.
*  I don't know. I'm just like trying out this new thing. Just, I just want to feel good all the time,
*  you know what I mean? So, just experimenting. And we, my wife actually got us into like
*  whole foods, plant-based. So, it's not, you know, like you can eat crappy vegan food, obviously.
*  I heard Nikki Glaser talking about this, you know. People talk about fake meat and like the
*  impossible Whopper and I had one. Yeah, but it's like, it just makes you feel
*  crappy like an old Whopper did. And so, like, if you cut out the processed food, that to me
*  is what is making me feel like I have energy all the time. Sleep better, I haven't gotten sick.
*  Pete Yes, good for you, man. But that's where it's at. You know, be kind to your body,
*  your body will treat you better. That's just how it is. Drink more water,
*  exercise when you can. Do you meditate at all?
*  Pete Yeah, yeah. I've been getting big into that. Yeah, how about you?
*  I guess you and Nikki are talking about that a little bit.
*  Nick Yeah. I mean, I feel like all these things
*  that we're saying, all these, the moves towards positive lifestyle choices will,
*  and also in some way, sort of negate this move towards these drugs and this, the attractiveness
*  of these drugs. If people are drawn towards being healthier and happier and cleaner and keeping your
*  mind right, you'll be less likely to want to seek this sort of that opiate just escape.
*  Pete Yeah. It's 100%. It's like, Johan Hari in his book, he's been on here chasing the scream.
*  Yeah, he like, blew my mind with these revelations that really, it's just like,
*  people can age out of these drugs. You know, I always thought like, when you're addicted to
*  heroin or fentanyl, it's like, for life, you're never getting free. But when people get their
*  stuff together, they just age out of it. And then they don't even have to try. So,
*  I agree with what you're saying. 100%.
*  Nick Well, I think the attractiveness of living a happy, healthy life is contagious. It's very
*  addictive. And that people, addicting in the right way, addictive in a positive way, you see someone
*  living a good, healthy life and being happy and being nice to people and smiling a lot,
*  laughing a lot and having your life go well, where you're making a good living and you're
*  being productive and creative and all those good, positive things. Those are attractive to other
*  folks. And I think they see that and they go, oh, is it, do I want to be like Mike over there who's
*  doing well or Cindy who's doing well? Or do I want to be like those poor fools that are under the
*  bridge that are living in tents because they have drug addicts, they're drug problems.
*  Nick Yeah, I've had kind of a debate with my wife because she, you know, all these drugs like
*  naloxone and methadone, these are opioids too. So, some people criticize it and they say, well,
*  you're just advocating for someone to go off one drug onto another drug. And my wife in particular
*  is like, you know, should really be encouraging people to go off these drugs altogether. And like,
*  whether it's a spiritual approach, meditation, all that, you know, and she's not wrong, but it's just
*  like, what do the numbers show? What are people capable of doing? You know, it's, I don't have
*  all the answers. It's different for everyone. Mike I don't have the answers either. My friend,
*  Artie Lang, I just did a podcast with him this weekend. Nick Yeah, I heard about that.
*  Mike And he's free and clean for nine months now. I've never seen him look better. His eyes,
*  they're, they're, they're sparkling. Like he's, he's there, he's present and he's talking. And
*  he detailed like all the various ways that he tried to get off and all the different things
*  that he did and nothing worked other than this last time he just kind of hit that rock bottom
*  thing and had slowly but surely worked his way out of being addicted into this place of sobriety.
*  And then two days led to 20 days led to three months led to where we are now. And you know,
*  he's so happy. And, you know, he's still getting his piss tested like five times a week. I mean,
*  he's under it's crazy because he's under this program where if he fucks up, he goes to jail.
*  I think he goes jail for a long time. He's not a dealer and he's not he didn't do any violent crime
*  or anything like that. He's just a user. It's really strange that they've got him on this,
*  this drug court thing, but what it's doing for him is it's forcing him to be accountable and
*  forcing him to be sober. And then he's doing that. And then, and then he's saying, look, I like this.
*  I'm going to, I can, I'm happy. I'm alive. I'm doing great. I'm doing shows. I'm, I feel good.
*  His fucking stories were insane. He's so funny. He was so, so much more like vibrant than I've
*  ever seen him before. And it was so, I love when I see people doing well. I love it. I love when
*  their life was fucked up and now it's not fucked up at all. Like he's doing great. He's on the
*  right path. And the more people see things like that, I think the better it is for all of us.
*  Pete Slauson I think some people, it's like part of their identity to be like
*  that guy who's like drunk, you know, in like the life of the party. And even like, there's so much,
*  like, I'm no, you know, I'm not like a teetotaler, but there's so much part of the culture
*  is drinking, you know what I mean? And it's, there's so many, like, I'm drinking beer for
*  breakfast. Like, this is amazing. And people get caught up in that and it doesn't agree. Drinking
*  is not for everybody, you know, but they, it becomes part of their identity. And so,
*  my wife and I do this thing called Kundalini Yoga. Have you ever done that?
*  Russ Brand?
*  Pete Slauson My friend Ari just did it and goes, oh,
*  got me high.
*  Yeah, it does. I heard someone else describe it as like, totally for drug people who like getting
*  high on drugs because you get that buzz in your head. It's like half meditation, half yoga.
*  I'm like the world's least flexible person, so it's not like hard yoga, but it's just that you
*  have to, it's mind over matter stuff. And so, you do things like, you know, we had to do this one
*  where you put your arms above your head and hold it in this position and do this mantra for like
*  11 minutes and you're constantly correcting your posture. You're trying to like, you know,
*  look in your third eye and your brain doesn't have time to wander around and think those negative
*  thoughts and how terrible you are. And at the same time, it's like a physically demanding
*  thing to do. I mean, it doesn't look like much, but you're like sweating and, you know, my wife like
*  got us into that. There's so many recovery stories because I really think it's like,
*  people think it's a chemical thing, but it's like a mind thing so often.
*  Yeah. Yes. And I think that the ability to silence all the internal chatter that you were just
*  discussing, like that thing like you think about being a terrible person or you hate yourself or
*  that is so common with people. And so many people just live with those thoughts bouncing around
*  their head and they don't have an outlet. And that's another reason why they turn to alcohol
*  or turn to drugs. They try to like squash that chatter. But when you force it, that's one of
*  the things that I really love about yoga is no matter what's going on in my life, it's business
*  stuff, personal stuff, creative stuff, whatever it is, it's bothering me. I can do yoga and the
*  difficulty of those poses makes me concentrate almost entirely on them. And I take a concerted
*  effort to just think about my breathing and like meditation, you'll go off track and you start
*  thinking about things. Oh, I gotta pay that bill. Oh, I gotta do this thing. Oh, I gotta make sure
*  I call that guy. But you can get right back on track if you just always concentrate in your
*  breathing, always concentrate on the pose, concentrating your breathing, concentrating
*  the pose and just know that you're going to get off track a couple of times during the thing. But
*  enough, you'll stay on track enough so that there is some sort of cleansing effect. And when class
*  is over, I feel better. I just feel better. What kind of yoga do you do? I do hot yoga,
*  like Bikram. Yeah. Yeah. There's a funny book about that. The guy who started that.
*  Well, that's the fucked up part about the place that I go to, they actually change the name.
*  They used to be called Bikram and they're like, wow, this guy's too fucking radioactive. And they
*  teach the same postures, which he didn't even invent, by the way. And these are fucking thousands
*  of years old, these postures. And the sequence he didn't even invent. He just somehow-
*  Popularized it. Yeah. He popularized it. And look, as gross as that guy is, he's done a huge service
*  by spreading his yoga across the country. And it's like many things in life. Things are messy.
*  Life is a messy proposition. And this guy, you could say, well, fuck yoga, because that guy is
*  yoga. No, no, no. Yoga is a physical practice done by millions and millions, if not billions
*  of people. It's the same with the leader of Kundalini, this guy named Yogi Bhajan. And he-
*  He's gross too? Oh, there's lawsuits against him since he died and stuff. I think any cult,
*  people call it a cult. They wear white. But he came from the Punjab region in India,
*  and the Kundalini yoga was only for the Brahmins or only for the elite class. And so what he did
*  was he came to the US and he brought it for the common people. And so there were people, apparently,
*  who were so upset about this back from India that there were attempts on his life. I heard that he
*  wore the big, what do you call that holds your hair? Turban?
*  The big turban, yeah. It's bulletproof?
*  No, but someone came in with a sword and he had a comb stuck in there. And it was like, I think,
*  a metal comb. And that was the only thing that saved his life from this sword attack from the
*  back. That sounds like a great story, but probably, probably bullshit. That's what I would say,
*  this sword bounced off my comb and I am here to teach yoga. Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah, something happens when people become like a leader of something that, especially something
*  that's so spiritually oriented and also sexual. There's something about yoga class, everybody's
*  in their underwear, everybody's sweaty, and you're all sort of releasing. And it's very sexual in a
*  lot of ways. That's why people think yoga teachers are the hottest teachers. If a girl's a yoga
*  teacher, your friend goes, dude, I'm dating a yoga teacher. Like, whoa.
*  Yeah, well, my wife's taking teacher training, so that's amazing. I think it's just like,
*  you have an aura, you know what I mean? There's something about it.
*  You're focused on making your being more healthy.
*  Yeah. But then for men, for gross men, the problem is like, all these women are like,
*  you, you've brought me such amazing things. I got another amazing thing for you.
*  Well, I mean, every cult, I mean, it's like, quit being such a stereotype. Like,
*  have a cult, but don't make it about seducing the underage women in the cult.
*  Don't make it about...
*  Or even any of the women. I mean, it's always, they always become sex cults.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And don't like steal everyone's money. Like, just change the script a little bit this time.
*  Yeah. I mean, everything from Waco to Jim Jones to all, if they wind up fucking everybody's wife
*  and taking all the money.
*  Yeah, exactly. What was that Netflix documentary that plays in Oregon?
*  Yeah.
*  Amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Amazing. And again, sex, sex and money. It was all about sex. That guy was banging everybody.
*  It was like orgies.
*  Yeah. It's fucking crazy, but that's always what happens.
*  It always becomes some wacky sex cult. Always.
*  Yeah.
*  Always. Yeah. I mean, that's the number one thing that makes people distrustful of cults, sex and
*  money. The things that people want out of life the most. These are probably other than love,
*  which is probably the wisest choice.
*  That's part of it too. Like, it's finding someone to care about you. That's why people
*  join gangs. You know, Ice T talks about that. His own parents never said they loved him, but
*  in the gang, they were like, I love you.
*  Right. Right.
*  He wasn't in the Crips, but he had friends and they took him in.
*  Yeah. People want meaning. They want meaning in life. And I agree with you what you said also
*  about a lot of times when people use drugs or drink or whatever it is that's their vice,
*  they become a prisoner to that thought that this is their identity. Like, it's this Mike,
*  Mike's the drunk. Look at Mike, he getting fucked up tonight. Hey, I get fucked up every night,
*  bro. You know what I mean?
*  Some of the best advice I got is to not be so worried about your identity. Like, think of it,
*  it was like a small I instead of a capital I. Like, I think about myself in certain ways. You
*  know, I'm like the guy who likes hip hop. I'm the guy who does this or that. But like, do I need to
*  be that guy? Like, if I don't listen to hip hop, I'll learn about all this other music that I might
*  even better. And so the more you just strip that stuff away, the more you can get to the
*  essence of who you really are. Yeah. The more you just enjoy things and not wonder whether you
*  should be enjoying them or whether they fit your package. Not just someone, but many people have
*  said this to me. And it's one of the grossest thing anybody has ever said. They go, I really
*  love what you're doing with your brand. Like, oh gross. But the fact that people think that way.
*  People can see through that stuff so easily if you're really doing that.
*  Oh, fuck yeah they can. But it's also like the idea that you are a brand. You're a brand.
*  Ben Westhoff, you fucking brand you. Yeah, I wish. What is that? I mean, what is a brand? A person's
*  a brand? Love what you're doing with your brand. Like, ew. So if you ever meet me, don't say that.
*  Well, I think you- Oh, now they're gonna say it. I think you pride yourself on just saying what you
*  really think. And I think that that is your brand. I mean, as lame as that sounds, like not having
*  a brand is like your brand kind of- Well, fortunately, I developed fuck you money
*  at a time where I like during the fear factor days, I got fuck you money and I used it to say
*  fuck you. And so like, I used it correctly. So I just, this is who I am. Like, I'm nice. I'm a good
*  guy. But this is how I think about things. I'm not gonna like- The problem with Hollywood is one of
*  the giant problems is that you're always trying out for the next thing. You're always auditioning.
*  And that's a, people develop an incredibly disingenuous mindset because the mindset is,
*  I wanna be manipulative to the casting agents and the producers. I want them to like me. So I want
*  to adopt whatever conglomeration of ideas they have politically, socially. I wanna fit in. So this
*  is why Hollywood is almost like universally left wing. It's not because the people are all,
*  they all think exactly the same way because they're creative types and that would be ideal,
*  right? But that's not what it is. What it is, is the people that run the show know that this is how
*  the show's run. The show's run through progressive thought. You vote Democrat. You support these
*  candidates. You want a woman president. You want this. You want that. You've pro everything that
*  the left stands for. And so these people, they don't even have their own opinions. They just have
*  these opinions they've adopted because they think it's gonna help them get through. And so then they
*  do get through and then they become famous and then they go, who the fuck am I? Like they don't
*  know who they are. They don't, they don't. And then when it comes to like, Hey, tell us your opinion
*  on this. Like, Oh my God, they don't even know what their opinion is. Cause they've never really
*  developed opinions. They've developed an act. And that act is say the things that these people would
*  like you to say so that you can continue to work so that you can get picked. Cause if there's two
*  people that are up for a role and one of them is like this staunch libertarian who's like this,
*  pull yourself up by your bootstrap thing that, you know, doesn't believe in white privilege.
*  And the other one is like super progressive. I call myself a male feminist. I want a woman president.
*  Like that guy gets the role. I mean, that's, well, the ironic thing too, though, is like a lot of,
*  you know, like real liberals see Hollywood as this like reactionary place in its own right.
*  You know what I mean? Like the right wing, like Christian part of the culture sees Hollywood as
*  this horrible cesspool, but then the left wing sees it as playing to this, you know, the Weinstein
*  stuff, all the like worst elements of, you know, male dominated corporate culture epitomize
*  in Hollywood. So it's funny how it's hated on both sides.
*  But I think that Weinstein stuff is the same thing as the cult stuff. It's just like a guy
*  gets power and he has a bunch of people that have to like, he creates their careers. Like you want
*  to be in this movie, you got to suck the dick. And that's what he did. I mean, he literally did
*  the casting couch thing on a grand scale with A-list actresses. It's what happens to so many
*  people where they have that position where they're taking people and they're hiring them
*  and then putting them in these magical positions. Look at her, she's on the big screen. She's a star.
*  I could have been the star, but I didn't have sex with Harvey. And then this creates that culture.
*  That guy just ran through that business with impunity. I mean, he was just doing it that way
*  forever. Yeah, I think, I don't know, like when you look at Hollywood movies, like what it is
*  and what the formula became, I always wonder if this is like something that developed organically
*  or if it's like we're hardwired to want to see this kind of like, take the three act structure,
*  right? Like every movie has to have a three act structure, whether it's the most independent or
*  the biggest Hollywood. So it's like, why is that? Is that part of our brain? And take songs, like
*  pop songs, they're all structured the same. Verse, chorus, verse, bridge, you know, chorus again.
*  And I don't know.
*  Pete Slauson Well, you read any Joseph Campbell?
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, I haven't read it, but I know the basic ideas.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, and Joseph Campbell, the journey of the hero, the hero's journey,
*  all that like mirrors itself, like that's the structure of most of these fantastic stories
*  where this hero goes through this transformation and faces this adversary and overcomes it. And this
*  story, this sort of structure is repeated over and over again. It's something that's like deeply
*  embedded in culture, deeply embedded in the psyche of human beings.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, well, yeah, there you go. There's the answer. Yeah, and so when I'm trying
*  to like write a book like this, I want there to be narrative and tell stories, you know what I
*  mean? Like there's drug books out there and it gets way deep into the neuropharmacology and,
*  you know, but it's like ultimately, you know, 30,000 people dying of fentanyl is a horrifying
*  statistic, but it's almost impossible to wrap your mind around it. When you know one person
*  who died, like my friend, his name was Michael Schaffermeyer in 2010, he died from fentanyl patches.
*  I had never heard of fentanyl at the time.
*  Pete Slauson A patch killed him.
*  Jared Slauson A patch, and he was drinking at the same time,
*  but then what actually literally killed him was when he was sleeping with his face in the pillow
*  and he like cut off, you know, it just cut off his breathing.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, Jesus.
*  Jared Slauson He didn't like have the strength to move.
*  Oh my God.
*  Pete Slauson And so, that's why they think these number of deaths actually might be undercounted
*  because his death was listed, I believe, as like cardiac arrest or something. So, that doesn't
*  even show up as a fentanyl death, for example. And so, but just, yeah, just that one story
*  means so much more to me than 30,000 people I don't know, for example, you know what I mean?
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, that's the problem. What is that old expression? The death of one person
*  is a tragedy, death of a million is a statistic. I think that was a Nazi that said that. Wasn't it
*  Goebbels? Someone like that? I forget who it was. Someone terrible had that expression. But we,
*  you know, we don't, there's so many people, that's also part of the problem. Like,
*  3,000 people die every year from aspirin. 150 people die every year because coconuts fall in
*  their head. You know that? Jared Slauson
*  I think Tylenol actually has the narrowest, like, therapeutic window.
*  Goebbels It's Stalin. Yeah, single death is a tragedy,
*  a million deaths is a statistic. When one dies is a tragedy. When a million dies is a statistic.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah.
*  Goebbels Well, that's a little redundant. Why do you say it twice? Is that a Russian thing?
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, people, a lot of times they've tried,
*  you know, many people have successfully killed themselves with Tylenol because it's got such a
*  narrow therapeutic window. Like, the amount that makes you feel better versus the amount that will
*  kill you is not that far apart. And it's the same with fentanyl. And that's why, like, I mean,
*  you could drink too much water and kill yourself, right?
*  Goebbels Yeah, there was a woman who did that on a radio show contest.
*  Jared Slauson Really?
*  Goebbels She was trying to win, like, a game station,
*  like a Xbox or something for a kid. It was like in, I believe it was in San Jose,
*  and they were having a water drinking contest. And there's also, kids have done it, they were
*  getting hazed for fraternities. They had to drink a bunch of water and they died.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, and people, you hear a lot about
*  ecstasy, overdose, deaths, because people didn't drink enough water. So, like, MDMA isn't usually
*  what kills you. It's like you're in the hot sun at a rave, you overheat, you don't drink enough water.
*  But actually, some people have heard that and then they drink too much water and that kills them at
*  a rave. Jared Slauson How much water kills you?
*  Goebbels I don't know.
*  Jared Slauson How much water do you have to drink before you die?
*  Goebbels I think probably a ton.
*  Jared Slauson Let's take a guess. You think a gallon an hour for five hours,
*  you think that'll kill you? Goebbels
*  A gallon, that is a ton of water for one hour.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah. You think that'll kill you?
*  Goebbels For five hours?
*  Jared Slauson Five hours.
*  Goebbels I have no idea.
*  Jared Slauson Have you had a guess?
*  Goebbels No.
*  Jared Slauson We're playing a game here, I guess.
*  Goebbels I'm guessing no.
*  Jared Slauson I'm thinking three gallons an hour.
*  For three hours, you're dead.
*  Jared Slauson You got the over under on that?
*  Goebbels What does it say, Jamie? Is there a statistic?
*  Jamie Boucher It's a millimolar.
*  Jared Slauson Miller, I can't say that.
*  Goebbels Miller molar?
*  Jamie Boucher Yeah, that thing.
*  Goebbels That's like for ketones.
*  Jamie Boucher I know. It's a sodium level thing.
*  Goebbels Oh, right.
*  Jamie Boucher Water in the blood level that gets to your brain,
*  that's what can fuck you up. So I'm trying to find out how much.
*  Goebbels Oh, so it dilutes?
*  Jamie Boucher Yeah.
*  Goebbels Dilutes your sodium. What if you drink water with a lot of salt in it?
*  Then you're probably just pee it out.
*  Jared Slauson You can probably get sodium toxicity.
*  Goebbels By the way, that will give you explosive diarrhea. Trust me on that. Last year, we were
*  doing the Sober October Fitness Challenge. We were doing all, me and my friends.
*  Jared Slauson You did this year too.
*  Goebbels Yeah, but last year we went crazy. We had a fitness challenge. This year we just went
*  sober and we did a bunch of classes and different things. But last year we went like five, six hours
*  of cardio a day, like nutty shit. And I was drinking literal just giant 64 liters of water
*  with epsom salts, or not epsom salts, Himalayan salt in it. And if you don't get that mixture right,
*  that stuff will come rocketing out of your ass like a broken fire hydrant. It's crazy. And then
*  I googled it afterwards. I was like, what is that? And then I googled it. It's actually like a salt
*  enema by drinking a bunch of salt. For whatever reason, I guess your body just goes, hey, what
*  is all this water and salt? This guy's sick. Something's wrong here. Everybody out of the pool.
*  And it just...
*  Jared Slauson It all backfired on you.
*  Goebbels Yeah. It just, but you got to get it right. It's just, you only need like a teaspoon.
*  You don't need like multiple tablespoons.
*  Jared Slauson Yeah. Well, I've been, you know, I ran a marathon and I'm into long distance running.
*  And it's gotten to the point where at first I was always doing it for my health. You know what I
*  mean? I was like, I'm getting my workout in, getting exercise. But then I grew to like it so
*  much that it was like negatively affecting my health. You know, like I ran maybe 10 miles with
*  my buddy Jeff the other day. And I just felt awful afterwards. But I love doing it, you know.
*  Pete Slauson Why did you feel awful? Because you were one
*  out of them.
*  Goebbels I don't know. I was grouchy with my kids. And yeah, my love, my, you know, everything was
*  depleted. And I was tired and hungry. And then the next day I was sore. But it's funny when you
*  cross that plane to just wanting to do the thing itself.
*  Pete Slauson Yes. Well, that's a high as well. I mean,
*  you're obviously aware of the endorphins that you get from running. I'd never really experienced
*  that the way I did during that sober October thing. Because one of the things that me and my
*  friends talked about was how when you do do cardio for like five, six hours a day, you don't give a
*  fuck. Like you like all of your fucks are gone. Like things don't bother you. Like people can
*  yell at you like, oh, hi, keep yelling. This doesn't mean anything. Like things don't bother
*  you. It's weird. Like you're on some I don't give a fuck drug. And I was telling, we were all talking
*  about it. I was like, if you could take that drug, how great would that drug be? Because you don't
*  use any cognitive function. It's not like you're high and you can't figure out what's going on.
*  No, you're the exact same person, but you have zero internal chatter and zero negative thinking.
*  It's like it's gone. It's like, and I wonder.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, the meditation is the closest that I get to that.
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  Pete Slauson You know, things bounce off you. You don't like judge everything so
*  carefully, so harshly. You just like, things come in, you process it, you react in your own time,
*  you're not letting your ego get in the way.
*  Pete Slauson I think there's a certain amount of physical
*  requirements that all of our bodies have. And most of those physical requirements are not being met.
*  And then when you do do something that wears your body out, you go, oh, and then you realize like,
*  oh, a lot of that anxiety was just this excess energy.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson It's just this body which is designed to be able to perform. Your body's
*  designed to be able to, you know, carry groceries and, you know, run away from animals that are
*  trying to get you. All these different things that your body evolved to be able to do and then
*  most of what you do is sit in your car, sit on the train, sit in your chair at the office.
*  And that's what a lot of people do. And because of that, your body's just like,
*  oh, fucking fuck, fuck, fuck!
*  Pete Slauson Well, they're, yeah, exactly. I went to the Boundary Waters, you know,
*  the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in northern Minnesota?
*  Pete Slauson No, what is that?
*  Pete Slauson It's like this amazing chain of lakes where there's no motorized boats allowed,
*  there's no motors at all. Some parts of it, planes can't even fly over.
*  Pete Slauson Really?
*  Pete Slauson And it's all portaging. So, you take canoes and then from to connect one lake to another,
*  you have to carry your canoe over your head and like, maybe a quarter mile. Some is like a full
*  mile, you've got your big packs on. Pete Slauson With a canoe over your head?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, the canoe over your head. Well, it's two people carry the canoes.
*  Pete Slauson That's long.
*  Pete Slauson It is long and it's like the most amazing full day workout we would get up at
*  dawn and like, we'd be canoeing and portaging all day and I had no idea my body could handle it.
*  I get my like 30 minutes of exercise in every other day and I'm like, I'm good. But now,
*  we're exercising hardcore like eight hours a day and my body just loved it and by the end of it,
*  it was like, oh, we have to go back to the city life again and it's not looking forward to it.
*  Yeah, if you get your body used to that, like I imagine if you worked on a ranch or something
*  like that and you're throwing bales of hay every day and doing chores and walking around,
*  your body is just going to become accustomed to it. Your body becomes accustomed to the
*  demands that you require of it. But most people just don't use their body enough.
*  And there's a really disappointing thing that where really intelligent people
*  connect exercise with being a superficial thing. And there's less of that now than there was when
*  I was younger, but that if you exercised and you were into your appearance and you were,
*  you know, you were trying to look good by working out, you were somehow or another shallow,
*  immediate.
*  You weren't concerned with books and like intellectual pursuits.
*  Yeah.
*  Right. But those things are not mutually exclusive.
*  Right.
*  And in fact, if you're really smart, you will realize that this is the only fucking body you
*  have. And if you're really smart, you realize that it's good to have a body that's not disgusting.
*  Yeah. The whole like hope I die before I get old, like I don't agree with that. Like my kids is like
*  sports is our bonding thing. It's like sports, sports, sports, sports all day long. And I
*  started to stop to think about that for a little while. I'm like, there's other things in life.
*  You know what I mean? What's the values that I'm imparting on my kids for doing sports? But
*  ultimately it's just like a sense of exercise. You know, there's some competition, but it's like,
*  it's not like they're crying if they lose, you know, a healthy sense of that. And just this idea
*  that you want to see exercise and physical activity as your friend because that's a lesson
*  you're going to use your whole life.
*  That is a great lesson. And again, to bring it back to fentanyl and drugs and drugs of escape,
*  the more you can emphasize, the more we all can emphasize healthy choices with your life,
*  the less attractive those escapes will be.
*  Yeah. You know, it's, it is, you know, why do people, you know, the sad thing is that the opioid
*  epidemic was so often started by people who were prescribed drugs from their doctors. And so
*  that's another thing. There's a sea change happening right now is that there's all these
*  new regulations about what doctors are allowed to prescribe. They're trying to discourage them
*  from taking opi- from prescribing opioids. And that's a positive shift, I think, for people
*  who are new patients, right? So like if you get a root canal, you don't need some crazy strong
*  opioid, you know, you know, or like to recover like from a dental procedure or whatever.
*  But the problem is that now they're starting to take away people's opioids when they've been on
*  them for a long term. Like I talked to this woman from Colorado and she had a disease, I can't
*  remember, rheumatoid arthritis or something. She'd been taking opioids for years and years and years.
*  And now all of a sudden the doctor was like, I can't give you these anymore. You have to take
*  these classes about alternatives to opioids, you know, and they talked about acupuncture and
*  yoga and stuff like that. And now that's great. But she felt like just degraded, you know,
*  and studies have shown that people, if they get their opioid pills taken away,
*  they're going to turn to street heroin as a result. And so the whole thing is insanely complicated.
*  Yeah, you talked about that, that there's three waves, right? The first wave is the pills,
*  second wave is street heroin, and then third wave is fentanyl.
*  Yeah, exactly. And so we're still facing the repercussions from the first one. And that's
*  what all these lawsuits that you hear about in the news are all about. And
*  another scary thing is that up until now, people hadn't been asking for fentanyl by name. Like we
*  said, it's just put in other drugs. But now in places like San Francisco, even St. Louis,
*  fentanyl is starting to acquire a reputation as a street drug because
*  longtime heroin addicts don't get high anymore. You know what I mean? They take heroin, and it
*  just gets rid of their withdrawal symptoms. And so fentanyl will get them high again. And so people
*  are starting to seek it out. It's a bummer. I hate to end it like this, but I think it might be the
*  best way. Thank you. Thanks for being here. Tell everyone your book, Fentanyl, Inc. It's available
*  now. Oh, yeah, absolutely. It's Fentanyl, Inc. How rogue chemists are creating the deadliest wave of
*  the opioid epidemic. And thank you for having me. I really appreciate it. I was good talking to you.
*  I enjoyed it. Thank you. Bye, everybody.
*  Much, much wider ranging.
