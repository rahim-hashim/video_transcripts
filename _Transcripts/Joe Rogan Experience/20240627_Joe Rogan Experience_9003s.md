# Joe Rogan Experience #2041 - Steve Strope
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5.8s)]
*  Just had a set of these on, had band rehearsal on Sunday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=12.52s)]
*  You look like you just had band rehearsal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=18.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  I hate to make you feel old. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=22.72s)]
*  But we've known each other for 20 years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=23.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=25.72s)]
*  Dude. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=26.72s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=27.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=28.72s)]
*  Does time fly or what? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=30.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  We've been friends for 20 years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=32.76s)]
*  That's pretty, really? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=33.76s)]
*  20 years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=34.76s)]
*  I mean, you know what I did? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=35.76s)]
*  I also experienced the odd time continuum to brief myself for this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=37.16s)]
*  I'm like, I should probably look back when I did this, this and this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=44.28s)]
*  And this, that and the other thing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=48.04s)]
*  I'm going, holy crap, I forgot. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=49.4s)]
*  That was like 2004? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=51.4s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=53.16s)]
*  2004 seemed so long ago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  That was the fear factor days. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=58.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=59.64s)]
*  That's like round around when I met you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=60.64s)]
*  When I brought the Barracuda to you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=64.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=67.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=68.08s)]
*  Because you, yeah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=69.08s)]
*  Because it was, well, I have my handy cheat sheet here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=71.48s)]
*  You actually made a cheat sheet to prepare for this? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=75.36s)]
*  There's, dude, I got paid. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  By the way, the shirt, it's exquisite. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=79.48s)]
*  I got it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Can I officially gift you in front of the camera? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Sure, please. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  Please do. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  This is a shirt with the Nova that Steve built for me. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=90.0s)]
*  Steve built the greatest Nova the world has ever seen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=91.0s)]
*  A 1969 Nova with... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Camaro-shaped sheet metal. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you have to see it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  We could really, we could talk about it all day, but people have to actually see it online. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  Lots of fun. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  I wanted to do the kind of... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  That's a dope fucking shirt. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  So there's a mixture of stuff. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  Like those clouds and stuff are taken from those crazy Chrysler ads in the 70s, like [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  the Roadrunner stuff with the smoke building up behind it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=111.16s)]
*  We copied that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=114.32s)]
*  And then the sun thing was just in every other 70s artwork I could find. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=115.76s)]
*  And then of course the prerequisite small UFO. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=120.92s)]
*  And I wasn't going to take your Joe Rogan experience. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=124.72s)]
*  And being that my other life was in rock and roll, of course I leaned towards the Hendrix [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  of audio experience. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=132.32s)]
*  So it came out pretty cool. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=133.32s)]
*  There it is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=134.32s)]
*  There's the car. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=135.32s)]
*  The t-shirt's very cool. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=136.32s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=137.32s)]
*  There's the car. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=138.32s)]
*  The coolest Nova of all time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=139.32s)]
*  I love that thing, man. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=140.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=141.32s)]
*  It drives so well. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=142.32s)]
*  It does. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=143.88s)]
*  It's not just so cool looking. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=145.0s)]
*  Like it drives so well. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  The independent suspension, the way you set it up, was it Art Morrison? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=149.34s)]
*  Yeah, Morrison stuff. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=153.04s)]
*  I went a little softer on the spring in the front and believe it or not a little stiffer [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=154.44s)]
*  on the rear and played with it quite a few times before I delivered it to you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=160.76s)]
*  It's magnificent. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=167.88s)]
*  Yeah, I was very... [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=168.88s)]
*  Because I set it up, I didn't set it up for track attack because that's not what you're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=170.32s)]
*  going to do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=173.68s)]
*  No, I'm just going to cruise around. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  So I set it up so when you go over those little joints in the road going onto a bridge, it [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  doesn't... [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Leave that up in the background, Jimmy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Just leave that there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=184.56s)]
*  That was the amazing photography of Wes Allison. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=185.56s)]
*  Wes Allison, you're the shit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=189.96s)]
*  He is the shit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=191.32s)]
*  That's a great picture. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=192.32s)]
*  I think I need to get a steel version of that picture and put it up in our... [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=193.32s)]
*  Yeah, let's do that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=197.4s)]
*  How big do you want it? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=198.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=199.4s)]
*  Pretty big. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=200.4s)]
*  We need a big one, right? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=201.4s)]
*  It came out real nice and the funny thing is, or the... [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know about funny, but the point of it was is there's so much done and none of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  it looks like anything was done. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=211.4s)]
*  Yeah, it really does look like just a really cool 1969 car if you don't know the manipulation [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=212.8s)]
*  that you guys did to the sheet metal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=218.96s)]
*  Not only that, the grill has changed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  The little headlight doors on the side, those are changed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  I used to... [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=227.52s)]
*  I would joke with different Nova people and go, give you 100 bucks if you can tell me [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=228.52s)]
*  what I changed in the front. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=231.6s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=232.6s)]
*  And they're like, we added bars. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=233.6s)]
*  The grill is actually taller. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=237.04s)]
*  Those bars... [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=240.0s)]
*  What does it look like in real life? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=241.0s)]
*  Do they just have black spaces? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=242.0s)]
*  What they had was a piece of plastic that came from underneath the bumper and it went [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=243.0s)]
*  underneath that headlight and then came up. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  So you see on the very outer edge, others like, I can't count from here, one, two, three, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=251.64s)]
*  four, five, six, seven, eight, like eight. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=255.48s)]
*  Yeah, those bars right there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=257.52s)]
*  The bottom three are added. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=259.3s)]
*  Oh. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=261.7s)]
*  Jamie, can you pull up a 1969 Nova grill? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=262.7s)]
*  Or a Nova front end. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=268.18s)]
*  Nova front end. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=269.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=270.38s)]
*  But there's lots of little changes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=271.38s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=274.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=276.38s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=277.38s)]
*  Can't see it in that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=278.38s)]
*  There you go. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=279.38s)]
*  You can see how there's just a piece of plastic under it and it comes up, the silver plastic [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=280.38s)]
*  comes up so those ribs aren't... [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=284.46s)]
*  That's not the greatest photograph. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=286.7s)]
*  That's a better photo. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=287.7s)]
*  That looks custom. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=289.14s)]
*  No, he's got the plastic coming up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=291.14s)]
*  Yeah, he's got something else. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=293.14s)]
*  You can see that piece of plastic come up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=294.14s)]
*  That's a beautiful Nova too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=295.9s)]
*  So we extended the grill and extended those outer things to just fill up the space. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=298.06s)]
*  It just looks better. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=302.82s)]
*  It's such a unique looking car. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=303.82s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=304.82s)]
*  That car is just so unique. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=305.82s)]
*  And I think it's one of those muscle cars that really never got its due because it kind [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=309.34s)]
*  of started out as more of an economy kind of a car. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=313.94s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=316.82s)]
*  A Nova, yeah, a Nova wasn't like, you know, if you had a Barracuda, you were the fucking [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=317.94s)]
*  man. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=322.38s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=323.38s)]
*  If you had a Nova, it's like, oh, you couldn't afford a Barracuda. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=324.38s)]
*  Like if you had a Duster. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=325.38s)]
*  Unless you had the Nova SS with the 396, but there were a few in far between. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=326.38s)]
*  There weren't a lot of people that ordered that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=330.94s)]
*  When I was a kid, this kid in our high school had a Duster. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=332.78s)]
*  What was the other one? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=336.26s)]
*  There was a Duster, there's a Dodge... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=337.9s)]
*  Dart. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=339.62s)]
*  A Dart. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=340.62s)]
*  Yeah, he had a Duster. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=341.62s)]
*  Or Valiant. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=342.62s)]
*  Yeah, and nobody gave it any respect. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=343.62s)]
*  I was like, that's a cool car. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=344.62s)]
*  I was like, what's wrong with you people? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  But there was like this thing where like some of those older cars were less desirable. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  So I'm in high school and so I graduated in 85. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=354.38s)]
*  So we're talking about, I think my friend had this car in like 84. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=357.85999999999996s)]
*  So you know, it really was only 14 years old, which is kind of crazy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=363.7s)]
*  Yes it is. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=368.9s)]
*  That's super crazy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=369.9s)]
*  Like 86 when we were driving around, a 68 was only what? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  18 years old. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=376.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=378.02s)]
*  Wasn't an old car. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=379.02s)]
*  Not super old. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=380.02s)]
*  Yeah, 18 years old ain't shit. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=381.02s)]
*  That's like 2005? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=383.7s)]
*  You and I are about to do math. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=384.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=388.26s)]
*  That's bonkers. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=389.26s)]
*  That's a 2005. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=390.26s)]
*  Which is like kind of a new car. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=393.26s)]
*  Like if you have a 2005 car, you can't differentiate them at all from a 2020. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=396.22s)]
*  Unless you're like a car connoisseur. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=401.18s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=402.18s)]
*  You know, if you have a 2005 Camry, it looks like a 2020 Camry. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=403.18s)]
*  It's interesting how time marches on, how perception of length of time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=408.14s)]
*  Like you were saying when we sat down with our friendship, let alone everything else. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=414.18s)]
*  It's like, how is that 20 minutes? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=417.46s)]
*  Oh, it's going very fast. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=418.98s)]
*  That's the one thing our older generation when we were growing up told us that was the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=420.42s)]
*  one truth. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=424.94s)]
*  It goes so fast. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=426.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=427.66s)]
*  Enjoy it because it's gone. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=428.66s)]
*  Because when you were a child, one year was literally like one tenth of your life. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=431.7s)]
*  It was so long. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=437.78s)]
*  It was an eternity. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=438.78s)]
*  Because you'd only been out, you had so few points of reference. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=439.78s)]
*  But then as you get older and you have more points of reference and more experience and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=443.34s)]
*  more life, then you realize like, oh my God, time is full. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=447.22s)]
*  I don't have much time at all. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=452.42s)]
*  No one does. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=453.58s)]
*  It's amazing how it goes quick, how the boost kicks in and all of a sudden 40, 50, 60. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=454.74s)]
*  What the hell just happened? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=461.97999999999996s)]
*  And you're just like, let's hang in there as long as I can. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=463.94s)]
*  I got some stem cells today. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=467.46s)]
*  I did? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=469.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=470.26s)]
*  I was reading this thing that this year, I'll send it to you, Jamie, but they believe now [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=471.26s)]
*  that through stem cell technology, they're going to be able to extend lifespan far greater. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=476.02s)]
*  The article said something about having people work until they're 120, which is not a good [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=483.74s)]
*  selling point. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=489.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=490.18s)]
*  Here, I'll send it to you, Jamie. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=491.18s)]
*  Hey, you could suffer longer. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=494.26000000000005s)]
*  Hey, you can hate what you do longer. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=495.26000000000005s)]
*  You got it already? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=496.26000000000005s)]
*  Others. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=497.26000000000005s)]
*  We'll be living and working to 120. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=498.26000000000005s)]
*  And it will start within a decade, says Doctor to the Star. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=501.1s)]
*  They're not necessarily saying you'll be working until you're 120, but living and working. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=504.54s)]
*  So this guy is using stem cells. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=509.46000000000004s)]
*  I believe we can create prolongation of life, von Schwartz cells. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=512.98s)]
*  That sounds like the beginning of every horror movie. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=517.22s)]
*  We believe we can have prolonging of life. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=520.0200000000001s)]
*  We can do it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=523.7s)]
*  Dun, dun, dun. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=524.7s)]
*  Oh, goody. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=525.7s)]
*  Probably within a couple of years, people can live to be 120, 150 years old, if not [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=526.7s)]
*  longer than that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=531.2600000000001s)]
*  It's not just bed bound, non-communicating individuals, but really active individuals [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=532.9000000000001s)]
*  who participate in social life, professional life, and have a quality of life, because [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=536.94s)]
*  that's the goal. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=542.54s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=543.54s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=544.54s)]
*  I'm enjoying life. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=545.54s)]
*  You know, I'm enjoying doing stuff. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=546.54s)]
*  And my friends that are older that are having like health problems, it really makes me realize [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=549.02s)]
*  like, man, you got to stay on top of everything. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=555.18s)]
*  Because if you don't, if it slides off and then you have to try to bring it back up, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=558.6999999999999s)]
*  it's way harder than maintaining. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=562.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=564.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=565.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=566.14s)]
*  You know, the stem cell thing, if he could, if von Doom there could get on... [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=567.14s)]
*  On the eyeball stuff. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=571.66s)]
*  Fixing the eyeball. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=572.66s)]
*  I'd be very appreciative of that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=573.66s)]
*  Let's tell everybody what happened to you, because this is a crazy thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=574.66s)]
*  Oh. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=579.18s)]
*  It's a real bummer, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=580.18s)]
*  You just out of nowhere started seeing dark spots, right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=582.3s)]
*  No. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=586.5s)]
*  What happened was, well, little background. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=587.5s)]
*  I had already... [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=588.9799999999999s)]
*  Stage one was going into your local doctor eye guy, because you have metal in your eye. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=592.54s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=597.38s)]
*  Because that's some of the fun that happens. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=598.38s)]
*  Even when you're wearing safety glasses, all the haters calm down, we wear safety glasses. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=600.5s)]
*  How did it get in? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=605.46s)]
*  Oh, it just bounces around. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=606.46s)]
*  You know, you're working with a carbide bit spinning at, you know, 15,000 RPM, stuff bounces [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=607.46s)]
*  around. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=612.9000000000001s)]
*  But since then, I have been using... [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=613.9000000000001s)]
*  I found this place in France that makes these antique motorcycle World War I aircraft goggles [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=616.74s)]
*  that seal... [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=623.1800000000001s)]
*  Like the Nazis used to use for duels? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't know that one. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=627.02s)]
*  You don't know that one? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=628.4200000000001s)]
*  It seals to your eyes and it's got little vents in it so they don't fog up. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=630.38s)]
*  But anyway, I got metal in my eye, which is, for those of you who haven't done it, it's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=633.78s)]
*  lots of fun. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=638.0999999999999s)]
*  You hold still, you're wide awake, and they come at you with a dremel drill bit and they [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  drill it out. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  Oh, jeez. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=645.7199999999999s)]
*  And the instructions are, hold still. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  Don't move. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=650.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=651.02s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=652.02s)]
*  I mean, they put a numbing drop in. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=653.02s)]
*  But you still see the drill bit coming. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=654.02s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=655.5s)]
*  And you have... [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=656.5s)]
*  Easy, easy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=657.5s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=658.58s)]
*  The stuff you've been through, I'm sure you can handle it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=659.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=661.78s)]
*  But so I've been drilled a couple of times. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=662.78s)]
*  That sounds wrong. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=665.14s)]
*  Ew. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=666.14s)]
*  Ew. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=667.14s)]
*  And if they came up with a photo of my eye, it'd look like a golf ball, little dimples [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=668.14s)]
*  when the drill comes in. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=673.5s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=674.5s)]
*  So anyway, that guy is like, you know, when they're in there, if they're experienced cats, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=675.5s)]
*  they just happen to look around. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=679.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=681.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=682.22s)]
*  And he goes, hey, I think you should come back and talk to our other doctor so-and-so [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=683.22s)]
*  and have him do some tests because I saw some stuff, don't know, but I think it'd be wise [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=687.84s)]
*  if you blah, blah, blah. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=692.2s)]
*  So I go in, we do the test, then the guy goes, and this is, wow, this is a while ago. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=693.48s)]
*  14, 15 years ago. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=700.88s)]
*  Here we are again with that time portal. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=702.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=705.08s)]
*  He goes, you have advanced glaucoma. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=706.64s)]
*  Then I go, what the hell is that? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=708.36s)]
*  And he goes, it's like creeping death. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=711.76s)]
*  Slowly takes your peripheral. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=714.76s)]
*  And most adults don't know that they're going blind till they're 80. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's moved so slow that you don't you don't notice the change. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=722.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, mine's trucking along. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=728.6800000000001s)]
*  And so we start with medication that lowers in your eye. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=731.2s)]
*  You basically got a faucet and a drain. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  And if the drain's plugged up or if the faucet's on overload, it's acting not like a water [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=741.52s)]
*  balloon but pressure builds. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=746.88s)]
*  That pressure is think of your optic nerve. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=749.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=753.28s)]
*  Your brain is the cable TV company. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=754.28s)]
*  Your eye is the expensive flat screen TV and the cable connecting the two of them. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=757.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=763.0799999999999s)]
*  That pressure building up is like somebody with a heel of his boot digging on that cable. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  And sooner or later, right. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=768.98s)]
*  So you take medicine to reduce the pressure so it doesn't eat away at the optic nerve. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=772.54s)]
*  OK, great. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=777.82s)]
*  We got that under control. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=778.82s)]
*  We're killer. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=779.82s)]
*  So then, oh, probably eight, nine years ago, I have cataract surgery in my right eye and [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=781.14s)]
*  put the cataract lens in and it's like, oh, my gosh, it's a crystal clear and beautiful [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=792.38s)]
*  and incredible, you know, stoked on it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=797.84s)]
*  About a year passes and I'm at PRI, which is the race, real serious race version of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=800.9399999999999s)]
*  SEMA. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=807.28s)]
*  It's in Indianapolis. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=808.52s)]
*  So there's no fuzzy dice there. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=809.58s)]
*  It's all race car parts and stuff like that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=811.9399999999999s)]
*  And I'm walking around and I just I don't know how to describe it, but it actually moved [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=814.64s)]
*  in stages like a curtain coming down just gray. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=820.92s)]
*  And then you just saw gray and it was my retina falling off, detaching. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=825.2s)]
*  So I'm in Indy and I fly back and get together with the doctors and they're like, you got [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=831.88s)]
*  to put that shit up. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=837.84s)]
*  And instead of doing the long version, I'll give you the short version. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=840.72s)]
*  Seven surgeries later. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=845.12s)]
*  And every time you have the surgery, there's stitches in my eye. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=847.12s)]
*  And that's fun. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=850.96s)]
*  That's way more fun than the drilling. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  And you're laying face down for a week. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=854.84s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=856.84s)]
*  Can't move. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=857.84s)]
*  And it just kept falling off. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=858.84s)]
*  They couldn't they couldn't go up. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=860.84s)]
*  So I went to another surgeon. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=862.0799999999999s)]
*  I also have a buckle permanently sewn into my eye. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=863.64s)]
*  They try to change the shape of the eye to promote the retina staying up better. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=872.12s)]
*  So anyway, got to new doctor, great guy, Dr. Asmali back home in Cali. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=873.12s)]
*  And he's like, I got this man. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=879.84s)]
*  These other guys, they're losers. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=882.16s)]
*  We're going to get it up there. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=885.44s)]
*  We're going to stick it up. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=886.44s)]
*  That was surgery six. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=887.44s)]
*  And it didn't hold. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=890.04s)]
*  And he was more I think he was more depressed than I was. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=891.52s)]
*  And so we scheduled seven and he sat down with me. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=896.08s)]
*  I remember before we went into into the operating room, he goes, look, I don't think I can I'm [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=899.96s)]
*  going to go try to save your eye. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=911.24s)]
*  I'm not going to save your sight because and he did it this way, which I thought was cool. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=913.76s)]
*  He went and did a little research to speak in my language. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=919.12s)]
*  And he goes, when you're trying to weld metal, if both the pieces are kind of rusty and beat [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=922.88s)]
*  up or whatever, it won't weld very good. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=929.44s)]
*  Right. I go, true. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=931.9200000000001s)]
*  He goes, so you got to have clean metal to clean metal to weld. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=933.1600000000001s)]
*  I go, yes, that's true. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=936.52s)]
*  He goes, well, all the attempts have just taken away the living shit out of the retina. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=938.48s)]
*  So I'm going to cut away the yucky stuff and I'm going to have a new edge to they use a laser. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=948.0s)]
*  They basically the only thing they know how to do is tack welded up. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=956.64s)]
*  That's what they do. Right. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=959.9200000000001s)]
*  So he goes, I'm going to make new clean edges. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=962.0s)]
*  I'm going to weld it up. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=965.5600000000001s)]
*  You're going to lose some site at least because I'm taking away part of the retina. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=967.6s)]
*  But I'm going to save your eye because if the eye, if we can't get something going on in there, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=972.24s)]
*  then your body will kill off your eye. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=978.32s)]
*  It shrinks back. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=980.16s)]
*  It's painful. Pop it out. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=981.0400000000001s)]
*  Put a glass eye in. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=982.16s)]
*  I go, yeah, let's yeah, let's not. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=983.12s)]
*  So he did that and he goes, I cut away about a third of the retina and I had a visual, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=985.6s)]
*  like a vertical rectangle of sight. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=992.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=996.32s)]
*  Not all the way over here to here, here to here. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=996.72s)]
*  But fast forwarding scar tissue moved over and pretty much just eliminated. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=999.0400000000001s)]
*  They're like, we can go in and we're not going to go in and do anything. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1003.76s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1008.24s)]
*  So this one's basically gone. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1009.52s)]
*  You know, that's that for now. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1011.52s)]
*  We'll see if science checks in. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1013.44s)]
*  Do you know who Michael Bisping is? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1015.52s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1017.76s)]
*  Michael Bisping is one of the toughest human beings that's ever walked the face of the earth. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1018.4s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1021.84s)]
*  This is what I said. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1022.24s)]
*  Not just because he was UFC middleweight champion, but because Michael Bisping fought the last 10 [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1023.12s)]
*  fights of his UFC career, including winning the title blind in one eye. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1028.56s)]
*  And he didn't tell them he hid it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1033.52s)]
*  Oh, I heard about that. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1035.84s)]
*  Yeah, he hid it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1037.2s)]
*  He didn't tell anybody. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you know gangster? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1040.0s)]
*  You have to be to want to be fighting the best fighters in the world. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1041.36s)]
*  Dan Henderson. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1044.56s)]
*  And not being able to see over here. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1044.96s)]
*  Anderson Silva. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1046.1599999999999s)]
*  And you can't see out of one eye. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1047.44s)]
*  Like his one eye is gone, man. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1049.68s)]
*  Yeah, I understand. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1052.16s)]
*  Which is fighting world class fighters that you can see his right eye is completely missing. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1053.28s)]
*  It's like it's just foggy. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1059.44s)]
*  He wears like a little thing that goes over it like a lens so it looks normal. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1061.76s)]
*  But he's a fucking stud. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1065.76s)]
*  That guy fought 10 fights with one eye. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  Just think of fight with two eyes is fucking terrifying. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1071.44s)]
*  And fighting against the best guys in the world. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  And he wins the title, knocks out Luke Rockhold with one eye. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1076.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, it took a lot. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1079.92s)]
*  I would sit there and practice like basketball into garbage cans just to try to retain the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1082.64s)]
*  depth perception. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1089.8400000000001s)]
*  Depth perception. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1090.48s)]
*  That's the real issue, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1091.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's difficult. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1092.48s)]
*  And then also it's frustrating when you're so anyway, the fun. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1094.0800000000002s)]
*  I'll interrupt myself to continue with the fun. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1099.92s)]
*  So now I'm where I'm at, right? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1103.6000000000001s)]
*  And they're like, your other eye is going to need cataract surgery. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1105.68s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1110.48s)]
*  And I'm like, so I did ask when the retina fell off, hey, did the cataract surgery have [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  anything to do with that? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1118.0s)]
*  Possibly, you know, and every doctor and every specialist and everybody I talked to all said [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1119.2s)]
*  the same thing. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1124.4s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1126.24s)]
*  Well, any procedure on your eye may, could, might possibly have the possibility of. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1127.92s)]
*  Like one of those commercials for a drug. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1134.8000000000002s)]
*  So it's like, did the operation on your eye cause the retina to fall off? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1137.6s)]
*  Anything could, maybe. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1144.8s)]
*  Anything could, maybe. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1148.0s)]
*  So anyway, so now I've got to have cataract surgery on this one. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1149.04s)]
*  I got a great guy who's one of the best in the West Coast, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1152.6399999999999s)]
*  We do the surgery and there is a mistake in. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1158.8s)]
*  Cause they're account for my pressures. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1166.56s)]
*  They tried to keep the pressures low because of my glaucoma. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1168.48s)]
*  Well, they went a little too far and my pressures were down to your normal eyes run. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1172.08s)]
*  Like your eyes probably run at like 20, 22, you know, maybe even a little bit higher, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1178.0s)]
*  but right around there for pressure inside. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1183.6s)]
*  We'll call it, we'll call it air pressure. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1185.6s)]
*  You know, it's not the right term, but so mine with medication, we keep it down at like 13 [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1187.36s)]
*  and 12, right? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1193.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  So when, after the second cataract surgery, the one on the one working eye, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1195.28s)]
*  they had dropped the pressure solo. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1204.16s)]
*  I coughed and it blew out blood vessels inside my eye, which when you wake up and you look, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  it looks like it's snowing inside your, it looks like it's snowing. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1213.04s)]
*  And I'm like, what the hell's going on? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  And at the same time, we did a special little surgery to like drill out the drain tube, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1219.2s)]
*  because in my eyes, the faucets wide open and the drain tubes plugged. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1224.32s)]
*  Oh, that builds the pressure. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1227.9199999999998s)]
*  So the medicine turns the faucet down and clears away the drain tube. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1229.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1232.72s)]
*  So we drill out the drain tube. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1233.52s)]
*  I'm over, I'm making this, I'm sure there's eye guys listening. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1235.36s)]
*  Well, that's not technically luck. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1238.56s)]
*  They drilled this damn mechanic work, right? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1239.9199999999998s)]
*  They drilled the damn tube open. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1241.84s)]
*  So all the blood goes down and plugs that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1243.76s)]
*  So that ruined that. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1246.1599999999999s)]
*  Yay. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1247.4399999999998s)]
*  And so they rush me and they basically take a needle and insert fluid into my eye. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1248.48s)]
*  I'm wide awake. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1256.24s)]
*  Mind you, just too little. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1257.6s)]
*  You ever been where the two handles under the table? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1260.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1263.04s)]
*  You grip on them? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1263.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1264.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1264.96s)]
*  Motherfucker. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1265.6s)]
*  Do they have your head secured or anything? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1266.56s)]
*  No, you just put it in the little foamy breeze. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1268.32s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1270.24s)]
*  So they do that and that was miscalculated and the pressures went to like 62. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1271.44s)]
*  And I was, what's the word? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1277.2s)]
*  Terrified? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1281.2s)]
*  No, I was throwing up. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1282.0s)]
*  I couldn't stand up. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1283.84s)]
*  I was so disoriented because it was, I mean, it was screwing with the deal. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1285.04s)]
*  And so the doc who again, great guy. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1290.48s)]
*  I'm still, I'm not slamming him. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1293.12s)]
*  And he actually met me at his office. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1295.28s)]
*  So like, I don't even know when it was three in the morning or. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1299.2s)]
*  And I'm throwing up in his bushes. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1303.9199999999998s)]
*  Out front. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1306.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1308.48s)]
*  And he did this three times. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1309.28s)]
*  Head in the thing, hands on the handle, took a blade, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1313.76s)]
*  lifted my eye and let the pressure out, let the fluid out. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1318.3999999999999s)]
*  So I'm like digging that, right? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1324.08s)]
*  So now we get the pressures under control, right? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1327.04s)]
*  And so that was two to three years ago. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1330.72s)]
*  And believe me, every day when I wake up and I can see, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1336.64s)]
*  Mike, is this the day this retina falls off? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1340.32s)]
*  Am I going to have a repeat of the last one? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1343.2s)]
*  Oh my God, I have clammy hands. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1345.6s)]
*  I'm the one that living through it. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1349.12s)]
*  You don't have to worry about it. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1350.24s)]
*  You're good. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1351.12s)]
*  But still, it's for you. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1351.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's, you know, but it's like anything else. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1353.76s)]
*  When someone has something they, when something is always over your shoulder, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1357.2s)]
*  you can either focus on it and worry about it [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1364.4s)]
*  or just go to the shop and build some cool cars. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1368.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you chose the latter. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1370.96s)]
*  That's the only choice to make. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1373.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I can't. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1374.64s)]
*  So I do go like every four to six weeks. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1376.0800000000002s)]
*  I have a lady I love, Dr. Tor. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1378.88s)]
*  I go to her office. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1382.96s)]
*  Luckily, it's like a mile and a half from my house. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1384.16s)]
*  So I go down and we check my pressures. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1387.28s)]
*  I don't have to. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1390.0800000000002s)]
*  She's like, you're fine. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1390.96s)]
*  Come in six months. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1392.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no, no. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1392.8s)]
*  I come in once a week, you know, but I come in like four to six weeks. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1394.0s)]
*  We check the pressures. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1397.28s)]
*  We look at the retinas. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1398.24s)]
*  We, you know, so we're day at work. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1399.2s)]
*  Have you looked in the stem cells? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1401.04s)]
*  Is there anything? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1402.24s)]
*  There's nothing as of now. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1402.96s)]
*  I have a meeting with the doctor, a smally. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1404.72s)]
*  I'm getting together with him next month. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1407.92s)]
*  And he's down at, I think it's UCLA. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1410.64s)]
*  He's real hip with that stuff. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1413.68s)]
*  And I'm going to go. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1415.44s)]
*  People are still hip. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1416.32s)]
*  Yeah, he's hip. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1416.96s)]
*  That t-shirt you're wearing. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1419.2s)]
*  With your fucking band hair. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1422.88s)]
*  Still hip, man. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1425.1200000000001s)]
*  So he's hip to all the new information. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1427.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to grill him again. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1428.64s)]
*  And I'm interested. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1430.0s)]
*  I'm going to talk with him because I don't know. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1431.2s)]
*  I was so when they were saying we'll go in and clean the scar tissue. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1432.88s)]
*  I'm like, absolutely. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1436.0s)]
*  Let me connect you to my friend Brigham. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1436.88s)]
*  He owns Ways to Well, which is a stem cell clinic in Austin. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1440.72s)]
*  And he was one of the most amazing guests I ever had on the podcast. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1444.56s)]
*  We explained how these things work. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1448.32s)]
*  But one of the things that he does is he's always up on the latest research [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1450.4s)]
*  in terms of like what he's the one who sent me that thing. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1454.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1457.04s)]
*  This latest article about the thing that was 120 years old. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1457.52s)]
*  The beginning of the horror movie. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1460.48s)]
*  They shall make you forever soldiers. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1462.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1464.64s)]
*  You will be connected to the big machine. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1465.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, terrific. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1468.4s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1470.08s)]
*  But let me connect you to him. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1470.72s)]
*  And he'll know what's going on in terms of like if there's anything going on with eyeballs. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1472.08s)]
*  There's a lot of really good stuff with neurodegenerative issues. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1476.16s)]
*  People that have all sorts of neurological issues have gone down. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1480.72s)]
*  I know Dr. Reardon from Panama was talking about that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1485.12s)]
*  He's the first guy I ever had come on and talk about stem cells. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1487.68s)]
*  He's the guy that came on with Mel Gibson. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1491.6s)]
*  And if you ever saw that one. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1493.6s)]
*  I like. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1494.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1494.96s)]
*  Oh, that guy. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1495.44s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1496.08s)]
*  I am how it was described to me was again there were at least he was being honest. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1496.8799999999999s)]
*  He was like the retina is like brain tissue. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1503.28s)]
*  We know what it is. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1506.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's yeah, that's about it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1509.12s)]
*  We can't reproduce it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1511.76s)]
*  We can't copy it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1512.96s)]
*  We can't make it. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1514.6399999999999s)]
*  We can't. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1515.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, I might. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1516.48s)]
*  But again, all they do is tack welded up with lasers. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1517.36s)]
*  My hope is they're going to be able to make new ones [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1520.1599999999999s)]
*  because one of the things they've been able to do with stem cells, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  they've actually made a woman's bladder, I believe. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1526.0s)]
*  I believe they reconstructed an actual bladder with stem cells with her tissue [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1530.24s)]
*  and then put it in her body. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1536.5600000000002s)]
*  Find out if that's true. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1538.3200000000002s)]
*  I think that's true, which is obviously it seems like that would be a less complicated thing [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1539.1200000000001s)]
*  than, you know, than an eyeball that has to take. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1545.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1548.0s)]
*  And I've heard of them trying to or somebody doing an eyeball. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1548.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  Because it's easier to make the whole thing than try to replicate. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1553.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1556.8799999999999s)]
*  That's what I was thinking. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1557.44s)]
*  I'm like, how are you going to connect it to all those optic nerves? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1558.16s)]
*  How are you going to do that? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1560.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1561.76s)]
*  What are you going to do there? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1562.24s)]
*  And what does that do to the what does that go south? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1563.2s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you forget your childhood. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1566.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1569.04s)]
*  Like what's what's connected back there? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1569.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1571.04s)]
*  I don't know how they're going to do it. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1571.76s)]
*  Dreams about hanging out with your brother that are going to be just gone forever. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1572.8799999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1577.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1578.64s)]
*  I I'll be interested to talk with a smally again when I'm yeah, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1579.84s)]
*  when I'm back in and just see if there's any new because I'm down for it. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1585.6799999999998s)]
*  Jamie, did you find anything about the making eyeballs? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1590.56s)]
*  Yeah, you were looking up the bladder. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1595.12s)]
*  Did you find that? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1596.24s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1596.7199999999998s)]
*  Making? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1597.9199999999998s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1600.3999999999999s)]
*  I think it's real, but I never know. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1601.52s)]
*  I mean, I say things sometimes and I go, OK, let me check. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1603.04s)]
*  Because like a lot, I don't expect to be talking about people making bladders. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1606.56s)]
*  It just, you know, this wasn't part of the plan. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1610.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's just how it goes. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1612.96s)]
*  Oh, I'm the benefit. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1616.0s)]
*  And we all we all benefit. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1616.96s)]
*  It's just a real conversation. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1619.28s)]
*  Yeah, the search shows that there's definitely studies on bladder regeneration, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1620.56s)]
*  but there's a difference between them like getting a functional urinary tract [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1625.2s)]
*  kind of like functional bladder. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1628.64s)]
*  I see. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1630.48s)]
*  So I think it does. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1630.96s)]
*  It's what I've looked at. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1632.32s)]
*  I partially see. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1633.44s)]
*  And an animal and a small animal, I think, is what it said. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1634.48s)]
*  They didn't do it to a woman. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1638.72s)]
*  That's what I was just looking into. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1640.0s)]
*  And then you kind of cut me off. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1641.1200000000001s)]
*  OK, go ahead. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1642.08s)]
*  Try to find it for a woman, because I'm pretty sure I read that. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1642.64s)]
*  I was very impressed. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1646.16s)]
*  They could have got me, though. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1647.04s)]
*  They could have got me some clickbait bullshit. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1647.92s)]
*  They get me so many times. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1650.56s)]
*  They get me these motherfuckers. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1652.56s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1653.52s)]
*  But hey, that's their job. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1654.4s)]
*  You got me. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1656.72s)]
*  It's fair and square. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1657.52s)]
*  That's the job. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1658.48s)]
*  Their job is to fucking make some shit that you're going to click on. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1659.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1662.4s)]
*  So if they can make the most outrageous version of what is kind of true. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1662.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1666.8s)]
*  It's iffy at best. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1668.72s)]
*  It's a little iffy, but it's kind of true. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1669.92s)]
*  A new bladder made for myself, it's giving my life back. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1673.04s)]
*  Bioprinting human tissue, especially. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1675.68s)]
*  That's the same thing. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1677.6000000000001s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1679.2s)]
*  No, this is from 2018. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1679.92s)]
*  It's not the same thing. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1681.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1681.68s)]
*  This was a little kid, though. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1682.8s)]
*  Is it a girl? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1684.48s)]
*  Luke Masella. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1685.84s)]
*  Does he identify as a girl? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1687.1200000000001s)]
*  Sorry, Luke. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1690.0s)]
*  Push that to the edge. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1690.88s)]
*  Trying to push gender ideology on Luke. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1691.92s)]
*  Does he identify as a girl? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1693.92s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1695.76s)]
*  Why not? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1696.24s)]
*  I'm just trying to be right. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1696.64s)]
*  Maybe on Wednesday. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1697.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm just trying to be right. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1698.96s)]
*  There are stories that are showing. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1700.24s)]
*  I don't know if I might have to find something specific to find the one you're talking about. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1701.44s)]
*  But hell with that. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1704.8000000000002s)]
*  Find the eyeball. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1705.68s)]
*  Yeah, let's find the eyeball. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1706.48s)]
*  The eyeball is more important to Steve. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1707.68s)]
*  To all of us. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1710.0s)]
*  A little closer for me. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1710.8000000000002s)]
*  So anyway, I'm going to revisit and ask them if we have to go in like they did before [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1713.3600000000001s)]
*  to scrape off the scar tissue. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1720.24s)]
*  Because I did have a vertical slot of sight. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1722.88s)]
*  Because this eye has a new cataract lens, which is still in there. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1727.3600000000001s)]
*  And I remember when I could walk around again and I was walking outside, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1731.1200000000001s)]
*  I'd cover this eye and there would be a set of this. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1739.04s)]
*  It would be like that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1742.88s)]
*  A vertical full height, but just not as wide. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1743.68s)]
*  But clear sight. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1748.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, you know, it's been a while now. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1749.6s)]
*  If they can clear that off and I can get that, that'd be awesome. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1752.72s)]
*  Yeah, that would be amazing. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1755.92s)]
*  I mean, yes. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1756.8799999999999s)]
*  And so they think they can do that? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1757.76s)]
*  He suggested it back then. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1759.44s)]
*  So I was not ready to do it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1762.8s)]
*  I was sick and tired of being on the table. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1764.8s)]
*  I literally knew how to put the IV. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1767.04s)]
*  I prepped myself for freaking surgery. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1768.96s)]
*  You gave yourself an IV? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1770.96s)]

*  Recognize you. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1780.72s)]
*  Giving yourself an IV is next level, right? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1781.92s)]
*  It's like giving yourself a tattoo. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1783.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not doing that. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1785.1200000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1796.64s)]
*  I'm going to say no for that one. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1797.2s)]

*  If they want something and they maybe want to draw it and they're very skilled, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1801.44s)]
*  maybe they want a specific kind of flower somewhere. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1805.2800000000002s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1807.8400000000001s)]
*  And they can reach it. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1808.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1809.92s)]
*  Stem cells from one eye show promise in healing injuries in the other. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1810.24s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1815.5200000000002s)]
*  There's another story too where a kid had a very specific eye injury that was called a stem cell. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1816.24s)]
*  My problem, it's not my problem. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1820.64s)]
*  Well, it is my problem. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1822.64s)]
*  But my situation is there's stuff they do on the outside like cadaver stuff, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1823.92s)]
*  but the inside like the retina is what I've been told is like no man's land. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1828.96s)]
*  It's like, well, good luck. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1833.92s)]
*  You know, it's like, oh, you can get that from a dead body. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1834.96s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1838.64s)]
*  They can't replace a retina. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1839.52s)]
*  And if I'm wrong, great. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1841.76s)]
*  Bring it on. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1843.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe they just can't do it now. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1844.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1846.24s)]
*  Then it's also someone else's organ. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1846.72s)]
*  So you're going to have to take all these drugs to keep your body from rejecting it. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1848.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure there's no. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1852.64s)]
*  My friend, C.T. Fletcher had a heart transplant a few years back. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1854.72s)]

*  It's crazy. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1871.4399999999998s)]
*  So your body, when you have someone else's organ in your body, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1872.08s)]
*  your body knows it's not yours. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1875.6s)]
*  So your body tries to reject it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1877.1999999999998s)]
*  So I imagine that does wreck havoc with your immune system, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1879.28s)]
*  but it's keeping him alive. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1882.48s)]
*  And it's amazing, man. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1883.6s)]

*  You know, but it's heavy. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1906.0s)]
*  It's heavy. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1907.84s)]
*  I mean, the heart is obviously the big one, right? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1909.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's the big probably really important. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1912.32s)]
*  We're we're fucking 10 years, 20 years away, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1914.2399999999998s)]
*  Max from them being able to suck your brain out of your head and put it in a robot. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1917.52s)]
*  Oh, good. That'd be great. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1920.72s)]
*  They're going to give you a Steve strobe robot. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1922.48s)]
*  That'll be terrific. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1924.24s)]
*  You're going to be like Ken from the Barbie movie. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  They hope not. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1928.08s)]
*  Yeah. And the new the first ones won't be able to feel real pleasure. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1930.32s)]
*  And so you have to sign off on that. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1933.28s)]
*  But then the next ones, the better ones, that's where this is going. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1934.48s)]
*  So you have to decide whether or not you're going to get another surgery. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1937.76s)]
*  Are you going to get your they've never removed a brain from one robot [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1939.84s)]
*  and put it in another robot. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1943.52s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1944.48s)]
*  Yeah, but they pretty they know how to do it. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1945.28s)]
*  They're pretty good at it. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1947.84s)]
*  Who's they? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1949.04s)]
*  These new people in the future, the robot brain scientists. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1950.0s)]
*  Oh, good. Yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1953.12s)]
*  Would you opt in for that or would you rather just say, let's see what's next? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1954.4s)]
*  Let's let the lights go dim and see what's next. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1958.56s)]
*  Hey, good question. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1962.16s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1963.52s)]
*  It's hard to say because everybody's scared to die, but no one's scared to sleep. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1966.0s)]
*  That's a good statement. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1972.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird because you're expecting the odds are you're waking up. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1973.76s)]
*  You should be expecting the other one, too. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1977.28s)]
*  Well, you know, true comes for all of us. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1979.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's the great equalizer, is it not? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1982.88s)]
*  I wonder if that's like, you know, if Satan was real, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1985.5200000000002s)]
*  that would be the ultimate temptation to trick you [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1988.24s)]
*  into transferring your consciousness into something immortal [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1991.92s)]
*  so that you can never experience heaven. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=1994.88s)]
*  Wouldn't that be wild if that's what's going on? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2000.0s)]
*  Because everybody wants to think that even people that believe in God, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2003.44s)]
*  they don't necessarily talk too much about Satan. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2006.64s)]
*  It's very rare. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2009.2800000000002s)]

*  where my grandma's house was. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2127.12s)]
*  That was a dirt road back then. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2128.56s)]
*  And I could take you there. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2130.32s)]
*  The house is on top of a little hill behind the area where we have our fireman's field days [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2131.6s)]
*  every year. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2135.52s)]
*  State troopers noticed all the fancy cars parked in Barbara's driveway and started [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2137.44s)]
*  taking down license plate numbers. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2142.16s)]
*  Some have suggested that. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2144.08s)]
*  How hard back then the 57 you get a license plate number. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2145.28s)]
*  What is it like a week until you find out whose fucking car it is? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2148.2400000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2151.28s)]
*  It suggests that one of the Genovese rivals tipped the cops in hopes of spoiling Genovese's [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2152.6400000000003s)]

*  Oh, God. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2158.96s)]
*  The assembled mafioso noticed this and began to panic. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2159.92s)]
*  Some fled into the woods, some hidden in the basement. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2162.88s)]
*  Others ran to their cars and tried to drive away. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2165.52s)]
*  The troopers caught about 60 of them. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2167.76s)]
*  When questioned, many insisted they were there for a barbecue. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2172.48s)]
*  They had just come to visit their good friend Joe Barbara, who was recovering from a heart [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2172.96s)]
*  attack. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2176.96s)]
*  When all was said and done, the troopers had apprehended mafia leaders from New York, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2177.52s)]
*  New Jersey, Tampa, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Dallas, Pittsburgh, and other locations. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2180.64s)]
*  But isn't that funny? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2185.28s)]
*  What did they bust them for? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2186.16s)]
*  Just be in there? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2187.52s)]
*  Were they all wanted already? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2189.2s)]
*  They just. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2190.32s)]
*  Well, I think the paperwork laying on the inside was showing dividing up territories. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2191.12s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2198.16s)]
*  It was one of the first times that the FBI had proof. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2199.52s)]
*  Hold up. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2202.72s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2203.2s)]
*  The whole thing made national news and finally forced the FBI to acknowledge that organized [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2203.7599999999998s)]
*  crime is a matter worthy of notice. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2207.9199999999996s)]
*  Some believe that J. Edgar Hoover's reluctance to acknowledge the mob's existence can be [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2210.3199999999997s)]
*  ascribed to the mafia somehow acquiring photographs of Hoover in drag and using those to blackmail [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2214.64s)]
*  him into leaving the mafia alone. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2220.08s)]
*  There is no evidence to suggest that this is true. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2221.9199999999996s)]
*  That was always the rumor that he drove. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2224.24s)]
*  But that would be the rumor if there was a guy that ran the FBI. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2225.7599999999998s)]
*  What dark secrets does he have? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2228.64s)]
*  If he's like holding the secrets of everyone, what's his secret? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2230.9599999999996s)]
*  Probably you'd have to have secrets. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2235.6s)]
*  You'd probably go crazy if you didn't. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2237.12s)]
*  You're the one who keeps the secrets. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2239.7599999999998s)]
*  You'd probably do the weirdest shit. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2241.3599999999997s)]
*  Possible. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2243.7599999999998s)]
*  So almost automatically you would think that he would wear drag. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2244.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's where my brain goes. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2248.7999999999997s)]
*  That's where my brain would go. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2250.4799999999996s)]
*  Like he's doing some freak shit. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2251.6s)]
*  He's doing some quote freak shit. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2253.12s)]
*  If you are more dark minded, you would think even horrible things. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2256.16s)]
*  They're doing horrible things. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2260.16s)]
*  That's always the worry that people have about the elites. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2262.08s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2266.16s)]
*  Like the skull and bones and what kind of fucking rituals? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2266.96s)]
*  Kind of freak ass shit are they doing? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2270.16s)]
*  What freak shit are you doing? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2272.2400000000002s)]
*  And getting away with. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2274.8s)]
*  Yeah, when you're on a $500 million yacht every weekend and you're just fucking balling [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2275.84s)]
*  all over the world, hanging out with your other balling all over the world buddies, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2280.64s)]
*  doing freak shit, staying in the club together, hunting people. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2283.92s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2290.64s)]
*  Yeah, freaky. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2291.36s)]
*  Freaky. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2292.48s)]
*  So anyway, background, small South African Baptist Church. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2294.16s)]
*  My dad's a deacon at the church. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2297.84s)]
*  My sister is married to somebody who's a pastor and she moved to France, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2299.44s)]
*  Montpleyre, and she's a missionary there. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2304.88s)]
*  So all the basic Christian education, I got it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2308.16s)]
*  But no one you know has had conversations with the devil, right? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2312.88s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2316.48s)]
*  But people, I bet you've talked to people that said God has talked to them. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2317.44s)]
*  Not I don't know. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2323.92s)]
*  My dad would never say God talked with me directly, said, you know, he reads the Bible. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2324.8s)]
*  It's not an uncommon thing, though. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2329.28s)]
*  No, but my background or the church I grew up in and my mom and dad are pretty strict. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2330.56s)]
*  Like Pastor Walter growing up, that guy was a logger. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2337.28s)]
*  You know, this was a small little town. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2342.32s)]
*  That's a cool story. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2344.96s)]
*  And he had, I'm not kidding, he had a scar from here down through his jaw to here, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2346.08s)]
*  a chainsaw jumped back and went, oh, cut him right through the face. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2352.64s)]
*  That's a manly man right there. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2356.48s)]
*  It's like a Teddy Atlas. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2358.88s)]
*  Took himself to the hospital with a tile on the side or a shirt on the side of his face. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2360.0s)]
*  Of course he did. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2365.92s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2366.64s)]
*  Probably would have fucking stapled his shot if he had a stapler in the car. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2367.04s)]
*  And he was the nicest, pleasant, like, hi, good afternoon. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2369.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's seen some shit. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2372.56s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2374.56s)]
*  Doesn't have to convince you. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2375.2s)]
*  So everything, it was real simple. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2376.16s)]
*  Here's a good book. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2378.0s)]
*  Read it. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2378.72s)]
*  If it says yes, do it. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2379.04s)]
*  If it says no, don't. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2380.3199999999997s)]
*  That's all. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2381.52s)]
*  There's no pomp and circumstance. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2382.0s)]
*  There's no robes. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2383.3599999999997s)]
*  There's no real simple, real straightforward. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2384.24s)]
*  But my dad would be interested and he'll be listening to this. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2387.3599999999997s)]
*  So he would be interested in your thing if the end times doesn't come. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2391.12s)]
*  And Satan can say, hey, guess what I can do? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2395.92s)]
*  But here's the thought. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2400.3199999999997s)]
*  Would somebody take that? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2401.2s)]
*  If Satan really was clever. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2402.24s)]
*  If he's real. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2405.2799999999997s)]
*  If he's real. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2406.16s)]
*  He is the prince in power of the air. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2406.8799999999997s)]
*  He is the great deceiver. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2408.7999999999997s)]
*  He is, he's very clever. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2410.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2412.72s)]
*  But if Satan is a real thing, what a genius thing to make it ridiculous to believe in him. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2413.12s)]
*  What a genius thing to make it so that even saying you're, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2420.3999999999996s)]
*  you've communicated with Satan or saying you sound like a loon. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2425.3599999999997s)]
*  Sound like a loon. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2428.7999999999997s)]
*  Because if you just talked about this the other night, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2430.9599999999996s)]
*  if the president said God is with our troops, we would say awesome. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2433.76s)]
*  But if the president said we've located the devil, he's in Afghanistan and we're beginning bombing. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2438.8s)]
*  He'd be like, what the fuck did you say? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2443.84s)]
*  And you're right about genius because if you're ridiculed or look like a loon for believing in [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2446.96s)]
*  Satan, then by default you're a loon for believing in God. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2452.08s)]
*  So he's done his job by negating everything. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2455.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, sort of. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2458.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, to a point. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2459.6800000000003s)]
*  Because a lot of people believe in God. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2460.08s)]
*  They're both in the same book. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2462.0s)]
*  They believe in Satan as a concept, I think. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2463.44s)]
*  I think it's like a, there's like a graph. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2465.76s)]
*  True. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2467.92s)]
*  Of people that, like if you had a pie chart of all the people that believe in God, right? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2468.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2471.68s)]
*  It's, or the entity of God. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2472.0s)]
*  The ones that think that Satan's a real thing is probably like a quarter of the pie. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2473.44s)]
*  And if they read, again, not some weird crazy, but just the plain Jane Bible. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2478.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2482.08s)]
*  Satan was the number one angel. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2482.96s)]
*  He was number two in charge. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2484.72s)]
*  He was the big cheese and said, I want to have everything. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2486.4s)]
*  And God was like, not gonna happen. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2489.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2492.24s)]
*  But isn't that always like even in the mob? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2492.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2494.64s)]
*  Kind of thing happened. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2495.52s)]
*  Number two tries to kill number one. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2496.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2498.88s)]
*  When they killed Paul Castellano in front of Sparks Steakhouse in New York City. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2499.36s)]
*  Is that the shot you have right there in the hall? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2503.12s)]
*  No. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2505.28s)]
*  What do we have in the hall? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2505.52s)]
*  Oh, that's Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2506.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2509.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2509.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a different one. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2510.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2512.24s)]
*  So in my area around me, there's a lot of Italian, growing up, lots of Italian. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2514.0s)]
*  Lots of Italian. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2518.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2519.84s)]
*  So I got good food. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2520.7400000000002s)]
*  There you go. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2521.94s)]
*  Really good food. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2522.42s)]
*  But so. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2523.46s)]
*  They know how to eat. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2524.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh, God dang. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2525.7000000000003s)]
*  If you want to eat for pleasure, the Italians got it nailed. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2526.26s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2529.06s)]
*  They do. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2529.94s)]
*  What's crazy is the difference between their food here and their food in Italy. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2531.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2535.38s)]
*  It's gone on its own shoot. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2535.86s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not what I mean. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2538.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, in terms of like what it does to your body. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2539.7000000000003s)]
*  I would really like some fucking signs to be done on it. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2541.78s)]
*  Like what is happening? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2544.98s)]
*  You go to Italy, you eat their pasta, you don't feel bad at all. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2546.34s)]
*  You come to America, you feel like you ate a bowl of glue. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2549.54s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, I can't move. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2554.42s)]
*  A bowl of glue. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2556.42s)]
*  I can't move. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2557.62s)]
*  There's something about their bread. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2558.34s)]
*  It's different. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2559.7s)]
*  Apparently they have heirloom wheat. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2560.82s)]
*  They have different wheat before we started fucking with it. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2562.1s)]
*  We should unfuck the wheat, kids. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2564.18s)]
*  Because I know it's like higher yield. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2566.66s)]
*  Joe Rogan's new unfunt the wheat program. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2569.46s)]
*  I think. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2571.7s)]
*  But you know, there's also some people that believe that one of the things that we're [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2572.66s)]
*  experiencing when people have like gluten intolerance is an intolerance to wheat is [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2575.7s)]
*  actually you might be getting glyphosate from it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2579.9399999999996s)]
*  This is a highly speculative theory, but they've tested people and they found that [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2583.62s)]
*  what was it Jamie? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2587.9399999999996s)]
*  Like 94% of people, 94% of people have glyphosate in their body and glyphosate is toxic. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2588.58s)]
*  It's an herbicide. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2596.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's an herbicide. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2598.3399999999997s)]
*  Is it because what we do to plant and grow wheat? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2600.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2602.58s)]
*  Well, we go corn, you know, Monsanto created it and they created a corn that is immune [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2603.06s)]
*  to it. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2610.66s)]
*  So you eat like this Monsanto corn and they can spray glyphosate on it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2611.62s)]
*  It kills everything else. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2615.38s)]
*  It kills all the bad weeds and you just get the nice corn. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2616.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2620.34s)]
*  The problem is that stuff gets in everyone's body in some small amounts. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2621.14s)]
*  And the question is like, is your body able to filter out the amount that it has in it? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2625.7s)]
*  Like what's the what's the toxic level? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2630.02s)]
*  Are we below the fear? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2632.34s)]
*  Is it fear mongering? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2634.1800000000003s)]
*  Because like there's a certain amount of top metals that you're going to get just for [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2635.54s)]
*  meat and sushi. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2639.1400000000003s)]
*  If you get some salmon or some tuna rather from the Pacific Ocean, there's real high [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2639.94s)]
*  possibility that you could get mercury in it. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2645.38s)]
*  Some amount, right? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2647.6200000000003s)]
*  Isn't it like what's the prevalence of toxic metals in tuna? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2649.54s)]
*  Let's just guess because I think I have a friend. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2655.86s)]
*  I don't want to mention his name, but he's brilliant. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2659.6200000000003s)]
*  And he won't eat fish from the Pacific anymore. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2661.78s)]
*  And I said, why? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2664.82s)]
*  And he said, Fukushima. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2666.1000000000004s)]
*  He said they're literally dumping this nuclear water into the ocean. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2668.5800000000004s)]
*  And we don't know what's going to happen. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2675.46s)]
*  We don't know what effect this is going to have. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2678.26s)]
*  We don't know the ocean is going to easily absorb it or whether it's going to kill fish. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2680.98s)]
*  We don't know if it's going to contaminate them. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2685.6200000000003s)]
*  They're going to have levels of radiation. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2687.2200000000003s)]
*  He was freaking me out. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2688.7400000000002s)]
*  And he's a lot smarter than me. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2690.82s)]
*  Oh, well, you're not. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2691.94s)]
*  And he doesn't fucking eat fish from the Pacific anymore. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2694.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm like, whoa, is that valid? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2697.46s)]
*  So what's the first of all, let's look at first one is tuna. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2699.6200000000003s)]
*  Are there levels, high levels of mercury and tuna? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2703.94s)]
*  Yeah, so you could get mercury poisoning from one serving. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2706.82s)]
*  Sorry, let me rephrase that. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2711.1400000000003s)]
*  The amount of mercury you're allowed to have in a week, you could get in one serving of tuna. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2712.82s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2718.02s)]
*  So if you're eating sushi every day. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2719.14s)]
*  Because I've heard of people actually getting sick from eating sushi every day. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2722.74s)]
*  Like they literally get mercury poisoning. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2726.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2730.02s)]
*  Oh, not not good. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2731.7s)]
*  No. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2734.74s)]
*  What is that shit that I had for? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2736.8199999999997s)]
*  First, Nick. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2738.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2739.06s)]
*  I was eating sardines like every day. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2740.42s)]
*  I love sardines. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2744.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2745.06s)]
*  I love them. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2745.46s)]
*  So I'd eat like three cans of sardines a day. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2745.86s)]
*  And I go to my doctor, I get my blood work done. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2748.1s)]
*  He goes, um, he's you have arsenic in your body. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2749.7s)]
*  Arsenic. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2754.1s)]
*  Arsenic. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2755.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2755.7s)]
*  Trace levels of arsenic. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2756.02s)]
*  And I said, how much? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2757.54s)]
*  Like someone's trying to poison me. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2758.66s)]
*  He goes, I don't think so. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2759.7s)]
*  He goes, are you eating a lot of seafood? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2760.98s)]
*  I go, eat three cans of sardines a day. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2762.2599999999998s)]
*  He goes, don't do that. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2763.7s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2765.7799999999997s)]
*  And he explains to me that these are bottom feeders and that they live a lot of times in [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2766.3399999999997s)]
*  areas that are polluted by humans. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2770.98s)]
*  So we fucking polluted the ocean to the point where if you eat too much fish, you get sick. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2773.38s)]
*  You know, all these people that are worried about the weather warming up and climate change, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2779.06s)]
*  what are we doing to the ocean? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2783.06s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2786.66s)]
*  I mean, how many, what's the number in terms of depopulation? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2787.86s)]
*  How much fish are missing from the ocean? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2792.58s)]
*  I think a large amount. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2794.74s)]
*  Let's ask the population, the fish population in the ocean now versus 50 years ago. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2797.06s)]
*  Let's find that out. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2803.46s)]
*  Let's guess. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2804.66s)]

*  Let's guess. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2808.8999999999996s)]
*  How much of the ocean's fish has been depleted in the last 50 years? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2811.22s)]
*  I'm going to say 50%. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2817.2999999999997s)]

*  Really? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2821.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to say 70%. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2821.9399999999996s)]
*  I was at like 45. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2825.2999999999997s)]
*  That's probably reasonable. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2827.54s)]
*  I might be fear-mongering. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2828.66s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2829.7s)]
*  Fear-mongering. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2830.5s)]

*  You know, like you play cornhole at the beach. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2838.6s)]
*  I'm not like a cornhole player, right? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2839.96s)]
*  I played a few times at the beach with my kids. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2843.16s)]
*  It's on ESPN now. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2846.36s)]
*  I guess it's a legit sport. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2847.48s)]
*  Oh dear. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2848.92s)]
*  So Jamie, what was your guess? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2849.72s)]
*  Help us all. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2851.0s)]
*  There's too many questions I have before I could give you a good guess [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2853.72s)]
*  because it's already a strange, like how are they going to measure that in 1950? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2856.12s)]
*  Good question. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2860.2799999999997s)]
*  And even now, how would you know how many fucking fish there are? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2860.84s)]
*  Very good question. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2862.68s)]
*  Very good question. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2863.64s)]
*  Especially when you- [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2864.3599999999997s)]
*  More than six. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2864.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, especially when you- [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2866.12s)]
*  There's more than six fish. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2867.3999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2868.52s)]
*  Especially when you account for the fact that we haven't really explored most of the ocean. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2869.64s)]
*  So how they measure it- [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2873.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, we don't know anything. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2874.52s)]
*  Is based off of how much they're pulling out. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2875.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2877.24s)]
*  So they measure how much they've taken in for the- [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2877.48s)]
*  How much they've murdered. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2879.72s)]
*  So what's the- [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2880.7599999999998s)]
*  Yay! [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2881.8799999999997s)]
*  What's the estimates in terms of the mass that's down? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2882.3799999999997s)]
*  1950 total catch of fish in the ocean was an estimated 18.5 million metric tons. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2885.08s)]
*  Now, a half century later, it says 73.5 million metric tons. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2893.08s)]
*  That's an increase. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2897.7999999999997s)]
*  But another guy says that 90% of all large fish have been removed from the ocean since 1950. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2900.8399999999997s)]
*  And I don't know, like how- [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2906.7599999999998s)]
*  How would he know? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2907.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2910.04s)]
*  Click on his. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2910.52s)]
*  Put it up there. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2912.52s)]
*  Let's see what it says. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2912.9199999999996s)]
*  That sounds interesting because that sounds crazy. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2914.3599999999997s)]
*  90%? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2916.9199999999996s)]
*  Clover populizes the work of fishery scientists such as Daniel Pauley, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2918.38s)]
*  a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2922.94s)]
*  who have pieced together a picture of imminent catastrophe in the global ocean. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2925.98s)]
*  Among the first to recognize that fisheries catch rates were in decline worldwide, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2929.98s)]
*  Pauley discovered in 2001 that the phenomenon had previously gone unnoticed, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2934.38s)]
*  owing to systematic distortions in catch trends that were skewed by incorrect reports from [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2939.58s)]
*  countries of big fisheries. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2945.26s)]
*  In 2003, Boris Wurm and Ransom Myers of Dalhoyse? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2946.7s)]
*  Sure. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2953.5s)]
*  University in Halifax, Nova Scotia reported that 90% of all large fish, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2954.3799999999997s)]
*  including tuna, swordfish, and marlin and cod, had been removed from the ocean since 1950. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2959.66s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2967.5s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2971.1s)]
*  The end of the line is informative. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2972.14s)]
*  Is that a book you wrote? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2974.46s)]
*  The end of the line? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2975.58s)]
*  Clover's reporting reveals that bluefin tuna, the endangered species with perhaps the most [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2976.38s)]
*  alarming plight in the ocean, is allegedly being bought and frozen in bulk by major [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2981.7400000000002s)]
*  corporations. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2986.62s)]
*  Once ocean supplies run dry, the frozen fish can be sold at sky-high prices. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2987.6600000000003s)]
*  So they're freezing tuna in bulk because they anticipate they're going to run dry? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2992.86s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2998.54s)]
*  They're stockpiling it like they do diamonds. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=2999.82s)]
*  Clover's portrayal of the global fisheries problem falls down on two counts. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3003.42s)]
*  Over-simplification and polarization. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3007.9s)]
*  Although current fisheries policy is inadequate, much of it's based on science. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3010.6200000000003s)]
*  Mm, okay. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3014.46s)]
*  Clover suggests, where have we heard that before? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3015.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3017.5s)]
*  Clover suggests, for example, that the practice of discarding by which some seven million [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3017.98s)]
*  tons of caught fish are thrown back into the sea each year has arisen because fishermen [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3021.82s)]
*  simply do not want the species they have caught, but wasteful discarding is more often the [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3027.42s)]
*  consequence of the fisheries policy that is designed to prevent fishermen targeting [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3034.6200000000003s)]
*  juveniles and species outside of their allotted quota. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3039.1s)]
*  Well, that makes sense because they killed fish and then they have to throw some of them [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3042.78s)]
*  back in the water because they killed fish that were too small. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3045.98s)]
*  But that's because it's indiscriminate. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3049.1800000000003s)]
*  They're still killing them, if that's what they're saying. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3050.86s)]
*  Clover's quick to point out the culprits of the fisheries crisis, slippery politicians, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3053.34s)]
*  greedy fishermen, and thoughtless consumers in big businesses while making activists and [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3057.42s)]
*  scientists the stars of the show. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3061.82s)]
*  But in adopting a tone of advocacy with its inherent moralism, Clover isolates viewers [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3063.1000000000004s)]
*  and misses an opportunity to place this problem in context. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3068.38s)]
*  Huh. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3072.1400000000003s)]
*  That's, it still seems like there's a problem. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3073.1000000000004s)]
*  They're just kind of like making it look pretty. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3075.02s)]
*  Overexploitation of fisheries is one part of the huge dilemma that humans face in an [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3077.02s)]
*  increasingly resource-limited world. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3082.1400000000003s)]
*  We can seek sustainability, but we will not be able to diversify our consumption indefinitely [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3084.38s)]
*  and climate change will decrease marine resources further. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3089.42s)]
*  They always have to bring it back to climate change. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3093.26s)]
*  If you don't, people won't take you seriously. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3095.1000000000004s)]
*  Those most affected will be the fisherfolk of developing countries who, fisherfolk. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3096.86s)]

*  Yeah, it's fisherfolk, bro. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3111.26s)]

*  Fucking scary job, but it must be thrilling as fuck. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3155.98s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm not into getting grabbed by a wave and thrown over the side in Arctic waters. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3159.98s)]
*  My friend Clay Guida did it for a little while. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3166.14s)]
*  I think he did it for the adventure, too, but he's crazy. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3168.14s)]
*  He's a UFC fighter. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3170.22s)]
*  He's out of his mind. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3171.9s)]
*  But he's crazy. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3172.7s)]
*  Yeah, he's a wild man. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3173.98s)]
*  But you know, that's the kind of guy who would, you know, take a ride on one of them boats, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3175.34s)]
*  go get some crabs. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3180.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3181.02s)]
*  They pay you a lot of money, though. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3181.42s)]
*  And they probably should. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3182.78s)]
*  I think they have to because people die. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3184.06s)]
*  Because it's crazy. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3185.58s)]
*  You fall in that water, you're a fucksville. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3186.54s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3188.46s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3188.86s)]
*  Yep. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3189.74s)]
*  And that thing sloshing all over the place. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3190.06s)]
*  I don't think I can handle that. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3191.9s)]
*  You have to sleep in that fucking thing. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3193.74s)]
*  Nope. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3195.74s)]
*  And they go out for a long time. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3197.42s)]
*  It's above my pay grade. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3198.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3200.06s)]
*  Not doing it. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3200.46s)]
*  Well, thank God you can fucking turn a wrench, sir. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3201.1s)]
*  So I was going to springboard off of Appalachian because that's from whence I came. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3204.46s)]
*  You ought to stay on track. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3210.86s)]
*  I love it. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3211.74s)]
*  So how I came to be here with you, backtracking to shop, backtracking from California, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3214.14s)]
*  starting in New York in our pre-mentioned Appalachian. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3223.9s)]
*  By the way, Appalachian, weird, stupid background. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3227.74s)]
*  Appalachian and Appalachian. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3233.5s)]
*  The only difference is the amount of peas in the name. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3236.14s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3239.58s)]
*  Which one has more peas? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3240.7799999999997s)]
*  Appalachian. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3242.54s)]
*  Mine is A-P-A-L-A-C-H-I-N. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3245.58s)]
*  That must be annoying that people confuse those two with you, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3248.06s)]
*  and you have to explain it every goddamn time. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3250.22s)]
*  I try to stay away from it. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3251.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3253.2599999999998s)]
*  Just say small town New York. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3254.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3255.58s)]
*  It's easier. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3256.14s)]
*  So I'm tinkering on cars in Appalachian. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3257.74s)]
*  I'm spending most of my time on stage playing. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3261.9799999999996s)]
*  Cars were my drop dead hobby. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3267.66s)]
*  Loved it. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3269.9799999999996s)]
*  At night, backstage, I'd be reading my new issue of Hot Rod and my little glass of ice water. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3272.4599999999996s)]
*  Couldn't wait for my new issue. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3278.8599999999997s)]
*  And I'd go to as many car shows as I could go to during the summer. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3280.06s)]
*  And the quick version is a real good friend of mine, Sean Davis from Canada, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3284.7s)]
*  said, hey, we're going to go to this show up in Rhinebeck, New York. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3289.98s)]
*  And there's going to be a guy that we're going to meet. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3295.5s)]
*  I met him at a big show in Indy, and he's going to make me a billet steering wheel [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3297.66s)]
*  to match my Boyd wheels. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3300.7799999999997s)]
*  This is where all the car guys could pay attention. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3302.14s)]
*  And so we went to the said show, met this guy, Jim, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3304.62s)]
*  wanted to go to dinner with him. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3309.5s)]
*  And the guy's like, you know, I'm a machinist. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3310.8599999999997s)]
*  I got a place in Riverside, California. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3312.94s)]
*  I should be back there making parts. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3314.7000000000003s)]
*  I need somebody to like go around the country and sell this stuff. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3315.98s)]
*  And Sean goes, slaps me on the back, goes, greatest salesman right here. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3318.78s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, what? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3322.7000000000003s)]
*  And that turned into a conversation. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3325.5s)]
*  And it turned into me like not letting go of it. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3327.7400000000002s)]
*  Sold everything I had. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3331.02s)]
*  Moved. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3332.94s)]
*  Got out here to Riverside. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3333.66s)]
*  Got there. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3334.94s)]
*  Guy had already been evicted out of his apartment. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3335.98s)]
*  So I've got nowhere to live. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3339.42s)]
*  I'm now living at one of his employees houses. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3340.7s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3345.4199999999996s)]
*  And we're working along. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3346.46s)]
*  Been there about a month or so. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3349.3399999999997s)]
*  And the federal marshals show up. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3351.98s)]
*  They're not in a good mood. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3356.46s)]
*  At all. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3358.9399999999996s)]
*  What are they looking for? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3359.4199999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3360.2999999999997s)]
*  But I'm like, here's my driver's license. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3361.02s)]
*  I just got here. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3362.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't kind of questions that they ask. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3363.98s)]
*  They are not asking me shit. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3365.5s)]
*  They're walking around with clipboards and looking at [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3367.4199999999996s)]
*  what I thought because I stayed away from it. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3370.06s)]
*  I thought they were checking serial numbers on the CNC machines. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3372.3s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3376.14s)]
*  I have no proof. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3377.26s)]
*  I get it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3378.46s)]
*  I understand. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3379.02s)]
*  So they thought maybe there was some stolen machinery. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3379.66s)]
*  Something because federal marshals don't come out for a party. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3381.9s)]
*  Anyway, how's that turn out? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3386.14s)]
*  Well, I'm like, oh, God, no, I'm not going to have any job. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3389.18s)]
*  I don't know anybody out here. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3393.42s)]
*  And this is not a car shop. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3395.34s)]
*  They're just machining billet street ride parts. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3396.78s)]
*  They do have one car there, a 40 Ford, which is owned by one of the guys that own TCI, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3399.66s)]
*  Total Cost Involved Street Ride Place. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3403.98s)]
*  And one of the workers for TCI comes down once a week to check on the car [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3406.8599999999997s)]
*  because we're one off in parts for him. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3411.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3413.02s)]
*  So I know that guy. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3414.06s)]
*  So we're getting our parts ready. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3415.58s)]
*  We're going to go into the LA Roadster Show, Father's Day Show in Pomona. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3416.8599999999997s)]
*  We're going to sell our stuff. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3421.42s)]
*  So I'm setting up on Thursday. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3422.7s)]
*  And this guy, the only guy I know, besides the two other machinists, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3424.94s)]
*  goes, hey, man, you going to come to our annual open house tonight? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3429.02s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I got no money. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3432.46s)]
*  I live way down in Riverside or Oceanside, actually. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3435.18s)]
*  But I'd love to go. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3440.22s)]
*  I've read about it every year in Street Rider magazine. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3441.1s)]
*  So I go to the party and I'm like, hey, man, you know anybody hiring? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3443.1s)]
*  And he goes, hmm, kind of hard, man. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3449.9s)]
*  You got to somebody's got to know you or have some background, some history, something, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3452.22s)]
*  you know, like, well, just throwing it out there. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3455.9s)]
*  So I drive all the way to Oceanside, get a couple hours sleep, drive all the way back to Pomona. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3458.7799999999997s)]
*  And the next morning he goes, hey, come here. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3463.3399999999997s)]
*  You know what? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3465.98s)]
*  He goes, like, 10 minutes after you left last night, a guy named Gary Daigle said he was looking for [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3466.94s)]
*  someone working a shop. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3472.3799999999997s)]
*  He's in Orange County. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3473.3399999999997s)]
*  And I go, I actually know the name from our list. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3475.2599999999998s)]
*  He sells our stuff. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3478.54s)]
*  He goes, well, he's two aisles down. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3480.14s)]
*  Take a right, go up there. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3481.74s)]
*  You'll see a sign, Daigle's. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3482.46s)]
*  So I went and talked with Gary Daigle and he goes, well, you're on Jim's dime right now. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3483.58s)]
*  Lunchtime. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3486.86s)]
*  Meet me outside and we'll talk. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3489.02s)]
*  So we talked, set up for a job. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3490.86s)]
*  Talked about having a job on Monday. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3494.86s)]
*  So Sunday night, we're back at shows over with. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3496.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm putting parts back on the shelf. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3499.42s)]
*  And I still remember because the place had like half the lights working dimly lit. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3501.1800000000003s)]
*  I see Jim come around the corner going, you might start looking for some work. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3505.26s)]
*  So now I don't have to ask off for Monday. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3511.26s)]
*  Went and had the meeting with Gary, got hired. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3514.2200000000003s)]
*  And so I timed it. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3517.42s)]
*  I flew home, got my 67L Camino that I built in my dad's barn in my aunt's garage. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3519.1s)]
*  And timed it that I stopped at the Hot Rod Magazine Super Nationals in Ohio. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3525.7400000000002s)]
*  And editor Jeff Smith and Rob Kinnan approached me and said, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3529.98s)]
*  we'd like to feature your car in Hot Rod Magazine. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3534.2200000000003s)]
*  And I went, well, okay. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3536.46s)]
*  But I got to go unload everything because every earthly possession I have is in it. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3538.3s)]
*  So I drove it back to the hotel, unloaded everything. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3542.46s)]
*  And brought it back. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3546.06s)]
*  You have a picture of that car? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3547.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I actually gave him. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3548.38s)]
*  I came with a thumb drive of a whole bunch of stuff just in case we talked about it. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3550.3s)]
*  Oh, you prepared. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3553.02s)]
*  I did prepare. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3554.3s)]
*  Let me see the 67. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3555.26s)]
*  It's a bright orange El Camino. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3556.7000000000003s)]
*  So when I got here to California, then custom classic truck and custom rodder featured it also. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3559.1800000000003s)]
*  There it is. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3565.58s)]
*  There it is. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3566.06s)]
*  Yeah, new street. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3566.46s)]
*  Oh, that's pretty. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3566.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3567.7400000000002s)]
*  So I built that. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3567.98s)]
*  So what year is this we're looking at? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3568.54s)]
*  1995. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3569.9s)]
*  Wow, that's a beautiful car, man. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3570.86s)]
*  Built it at home. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3573.02s)]
*  And so. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3574.86s)]
*  And then you drove it across the country. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3576.14s)]
*  Yeah, drove it across country. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3577.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3578.78s)]
*  What was in that thing? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3579.34s)]
*  Stroker 355. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3581.18s)]
*  It was a Stroker small block, but it'd get going just fine. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3583.2599999999998s)]
*  It's beautiful, man. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3587.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3588.06s)]
*  I usually don't like El Caminos. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3588.54s)]
*  Yeah, I like them for some. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3589.98s)]
*  They're so weird. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3592.22s)]
*  They're so weird. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3593.66s)]
*  It's like, why is there like this open spot in the back that catches air? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3594.38s)]
*  Those El Caminos are station wagons with the top pulled off. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3598.14s)]
*  The floor pan. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3602.06s)]
*  In the bed. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3605.2599999999998s)]
*  Same frame. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3605.66s)]
*  At the very front of the bed where it kisses the back of the cab, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3606.46s)]
*  they have a bolt in piece of metal. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3609.98s)]
*  When you take that out, that's the floor pan for the rear seat in the station wagon. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3612.2999999999997s)]
*  So it's a station wagon with the back taken off and a bed. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3617.2599999999998s)]
*  It's just like, who was like, I want a car, but I also want a pickup truck. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3620.06s)]
*  I want a trar. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3622.7799999999997s)]
*  That kind of stopped happening. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3623.8999999999996s)]
*  They gave up. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3625.58s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3626.14s)]
*  Like if they tried to bring back the El Camino today, people are like, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3626.8599999999997s)]
*  what the fuck are you doing with this? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3629.18s)]
*  GM still had one for a while down in Australia. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3630.94s)]
*  They did? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3633.98s)]
*  Yeah, they had like, they call it a Ute. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3634.46s)]
*  You base it off of the Mandero, which was like their GTO, the Chevelle. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3637.34s)]
*  They had it for a while. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3640.86s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3642.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3642.54s)]
*  They like different stuff down there, though. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3643.34s)]
*  They do. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3645.1s)]
*  Australia has different tastes. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3646.14s)]
*  They love, they like a lot of utility. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3647.58s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3650.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3650.94s)]
*  That was really recent. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3652.38s)]
*  I love his reaction. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3653.5s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3654.54s)]
*  Well, a lot of those folks, they like to fucking crocodile dundee it up and go out in the backwoods. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3655.42s)]
*  You know, they need something to throw a fucking tent. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3660.2200000000003s)]
*  Those things are built though. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3662.54s)]
*  The motor and the drive train are basically Camaro. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3664.14s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3667.98s)]
*  Actually, now I'm changing my mind. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3668.94s)]
*  That might have made it in America. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3670.3s)]
*  People would have bought that. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3672.06s)]
*  There's some knuckleheads that would have bought that. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3673.26s)]
*  That's nice. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3676.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm being honest. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3678.2200000000003s)]
*  You have to be a knucklehead to choose that. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3679.5s)]
*  Not that that's a bad thing. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3682.2200000000003s)]
*  Some of my favorite people are knuckleheads. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3683.5s)]
*  Yeah, but if you're like, if you have tuned that between that or a new Mustang, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3686.06s)]
*  what the fuck are you doing? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3689.66s)]
*  You could throw stuff in the bag. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3691.3399999999997s)]
*  So what? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3692.62s)]
*  Can you get the Mustang? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3694.22s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3696.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3697.66s)]
*  There's no if, ands, or buts. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3698.38s)]
*  We're bringing it back. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3700.06s)]
*  There's no if, ands, or buts. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3701.18s)]
*  Mustang's one of the few cars that kept it together. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3702.54s)]
*  Like they lost it for a long time, but they got it back and now they're better than ever. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3705.8199999999997s)]
*  Like these new Mustangs they're putting out today, they're fucking amazing. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3709.42s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3712.86s)]
*  They're great cars. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3713.18s)]
*  Brutal. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3714.14s)]
*  That new one, the Dark Horse, that's a fucking great car. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3714.7s)]
*  Right from the factory, six-speed, 500 horsepower, reasonably priced. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3718.9399999999996s)]
*  Looks fucking great. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3723.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3725.2599999999998s)]
*  They're making like real muscle cars, but like modern muscle cars today. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3726.14s)]
*  Oh, heck yeah. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3729.66s)]
*  It's nice that that's still going on. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3730.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3731.8199999999997s)]
*  I seem to be a proponent for that. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3734.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like people forgot the American muscle car is one of the most [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3735.8199999999997s)]
*  fun things to drive ever. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3739.66s)]
*  Sure. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3741.3399999999997s)]
*  It might not handle the best, it might not be the fastest, it might not this, it might not that, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3741.82s)]
*  but it's what it does to you, like how it makes you feel when you drive it. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3746.6200000000003s)]
*  They're very visceral. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3750.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3751.5s)]
*  It's very visceral. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3752.06s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3752.86s)]
*  It stimulates you. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3754.94s)]
*  It's warm. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3756.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I like driving them cross-country. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3757.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3759.5s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3759.9s)]
*  Window down, arm out. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3760.3s)]
*  Yeah, they're alive. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3761.6600000000003s)]
*  You're in a goddamn Matthew McConaughey movie. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3762.78s)]
*  You're alive. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3765.6600000000003s)]
*  So I get here and I wind up staying, working for Gary Daigle, and the car gets in a bunch [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3766.7s)]
*  of magazines. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3772.62s)]
*  I wind up moving from the Orange County area up the studio city, join a new band, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3773.66s)]
*  start recording an album, and I sell my El Camino to a kid in Japan, and I'm like, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3779.98s)]
*  I gotta do a cool car. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3786.7s)]
*  So I went down, it's still there on the corner of Ventura Boulevard. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3789.1s)]
*  Someone in Japan bought it? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3793.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3794.8599999999997s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3795.5s)]
*  So now it's over in Tokyo? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3796.94s)]
*  Somewhere. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3798.14s)]
*  Do you ever keep an eye on it? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3798.62s)]
*  No, I don't know where it went. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3799.34s)]
*  That was a while ago. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3800.38s)]
*  Maybe someone will reach out. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3801.18s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3802.7s)]
*  So on the corner of Laurel Canyon and Ventura Boulevard down in Studio City, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3803.58s)]
*  right now it's still a FedEx office, but it was a Kinkos. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3809.9s)]
*  The Kinkos was where Pure Vision begat. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3813.18s)]
*  I was there photocopying my magazine features, and I had my friend Matt Willoughby in Ohio [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3817.82s)]
*  draw this idea of this 66 charger that was called Scully, because that's what the pros [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3822.78s)]
*  do. They had artwork first. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3828.94s)]
*  And I went to Hot Rod and said, hey, you guys thought I was cool before I built a car that [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3830.7000000000003s)]
*  you featured, and I'm going to build this thing, and I'm going to show up on your power tour, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3836.86s)]
*  right? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3840.94s)]
*  And I'm going to use these parts to all these people that sponsor your power tour. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3841.42s)]
*  Is that you as a young man, is that this voice? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3844.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, who knows. We're an idiot, whatever I am. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3846.94s)]
*  So I go over to all the potential sponsors. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3849.5s)]
*  All right, I'll sound more official. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3851.58s)]
*  No, just be yourself. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3852.7799999999997s)]
*  Go over all the sponsored potential guys and go, hey, I had to mail. There was no email. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3853.74s)]
*  So I mailed these packets of color photocopies of my El Camino that's been in the prior magazines [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3859.8199999999997s)]
*  proving like, hey, I've done it once, and going, hey, my proposal is I'm going to build this car, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3867.02s)]
*  and I'm going to take it on the power tour that you are sponsoring. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3872.2999999999997s)]
*  So basically, they sponsored me with some parts, and they ran the artwork of my car. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3875.2599999999998s)]
*  And I built it in my shared tandem parking garage, underground parking garage at my [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3881.34s)]
*  apartment on Whitsett Avenue, which is where Whitsett crosses into, crashes into Ventura [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3887.02s)]
*  Boulevard. Built it there. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3891.5s)]
*  So you built it in a parking garage? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3893.5s)]
*  A lot of it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3896.2200000000003s)]
*  You shared with other people? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3896.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I would go to the junkyard, get the parts, like the example. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3898.1400000000003s)]
*  How big is it? This is a two-car garage? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3901.58s)]
*  No, it's an underground parking garage. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3903.42s)]
*  Like how many people are parked in that garage? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3905.42s)]
*  Well, that's 10, and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3907.42s)]
*  twelve. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3910.46s)]
*  And you have just one spot? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3910.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3912.62s)]
*  And in that one spot, you're building a car? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3913.1800000000003s)]
*  Pretty much. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3915.5s)]
*  And so there's a car right next to you while you're building this car? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3915.98s)]
*  So you're pulling fenders off and sharing a car right there? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3918.94s)]
*  A lot of stuff was done in that garage, yes. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3922.3s)]
*  That's crazy. I would never park next to you. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3924.46s)]
*  Right. Well, I am wonderfully respectful. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3926.86s)]
*  I'm sure, but who the fuck is going to park next to the guy who's building a car? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3929.82s)]
*  They don't know. It's covered all day. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3933.42s)]
*  I work at night. So I'll give you an example of what I did. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3935.42s)]
*  I went to the junkyard for the front end swap pieces to convert it to disc brakes, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3938.06s)]
*  right? Because I know the swaps and all that stuff. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3941.82s)]
*  So I get all those parts, and out the back of the apartment building, there's a concrete slab, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3944.38s)]
*  and that's it. There was like a really bad table and a chair. Nobody ever sits there. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3951.7400000000002s)]
*  So I found the one outside the building, electric outlet. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3957.1800000000003s)]
*  Bought two extension cords to go over because it's all the way on the other side of the building. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3962.62s)]
*  Wrap it around the building. And I got a drill and a wire wheel on it [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3965.74s)]
*  and a screwdriver. And I scraped all the old muck and then wire wheeled them to bare metal, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3969.66s)]
*  all the parts. And then I went to the... Did you have goggles on back then? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3974.54s)]
*  Yeah. So you're in the garage. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3978.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm not in the garage. I'm out back of the building now, grinding everything clean. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3980.86s)]
*  And then wiped everything with acetone. And then at night, about two in the morning, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3985.82s)]
*  I went to the Home Depot, and those pieces of plastic you can buy there, when you paint a room, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3989.74s)]
*  it's like 12 foot by 15 foot, whatever, covered everybody's cars. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3995.98s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=3999.66s)]
*  And then I hung all the parts on the water pipes. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4000.62s)]
*  Imagine coming out like you go to your friend's house at three in the morning. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4003.42s)]
*  I go downstairs, your car's covered with plastic and this fucking lunatic. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4007.98s)]
*  I covered all the cars so no one would get any paint on it, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4011.98s)]
*  and epoxy painted all the suspension parts. I hung them from the water pipes. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4015.1s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4018.86s)]
*  Then I'd assemble the car. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4020.14s)]
*  When did you get done? When did you stop at 6.30 in the morning? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4022.86s)]
*  Yeah, whenever. Did anybody ever come out and see their car covered in plastic? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4026.2999999999997s)]
*  No, I always removed all the evidence. No one ever knew nothing. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4030.46s)]
*  How many nights a week did you have people's cars covered in plastic? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4033.42s)]
*  All the time. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4035.9s)]
*  That is so wild. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4036.7799999999997s)]
*  All the time. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4038.38s)]
*  That's so wild. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4038.94s)]
*  And so I had another friend that I did exchange work. He painted it for me and let me use his [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4039.98s)]
*  place for reassembly. And I rebuilt the suspension and the engine in his 67 pickup truck for exchange. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4044.78s)]
*  So I get the car ready, take it to the kickoff party for the power tour. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4053.02s)]
*  We're going to drive from California to Michigan. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4057.82s)]
*  And I haven't even changed the cam break-in oil yet. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4062.0600000000004s)]
*  This car is fresh. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4066.3s)]
*  Fresh. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4068.5400000000004s)]
*  And I'm going to drive it to, which I did, by the way. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4069.02s)]
*  So kickoff party. What begat from that is OutRod magazine featured it. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4072.06s)]
*  Mopar Muscle featured it. Put it on the cover. Daytona magazine in Japan featured it. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4078.14s)]
*  There it is. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4081.74s)]
*  And at the end of the year, yeah, there's Scully. That's a photo shoot. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4082.2999999999997s)]
*  That's a kind of an odd black and white, but it's a Jaguar color called Topaz. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4085.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a blue, right? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4091.66s)]
*  No, no, it's a light silvery gold. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4093.18s)]
*  It's on that thumb drive. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4095.9s)]
*  Oh, there it is right there. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4096.78s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4097.9s)]
*  Why do you think Topaz? Oh, I'm thinking of- [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4098.86s)]
*  So that's the car I built in the underground parking garage. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4100.3s)]
*  God, that's beautiful, man. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4102.3s)]
*  Yeah, it came out nice. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4103.42s)]
*  Oh my God, that's gorgeous. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4104.22s)]
*  At the end of the year, it also got top 10 car of the year. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4105.58s)]
*  And you built it in a fucking garage with a bunch of cars covered in plastic. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4108.9400000000005s)]
*  You know what? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4112.62s)]
*  Dude, that's beautiful. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4113.18s)]
*  It's when you want to, bad enough. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4113.58s)]
*  Yeah. Look how beautiful that car is. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4115.58s)]
*  Pretty car. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4118.14s)]
*  God, that's so nice. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4119.42s)]
*  And so that started the ball. Well, the El Camino technically did. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4120.9400000000005s)]
*  But look how beautiful car that is, man. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4124.3s)]
*  So other pictures of that? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4126.38s)]
*  Yeah, there's some other stuff up over there. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4127.66s)]
*  Click on that link that says Pure Vision Scully right under the big picture. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4129.42s)]
*  Oh, that's the graphic I designed. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4134.46s)]
*  Oh, that whole, that stupid skull right there has a story. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4136.46s)]
*  So I designed this pinstripe. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4140.54s)]
*  I wanted bone red bone. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4142.62s)]
*  And then at the very front, obviously, the bone turns into the skull with wraparound glasses. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4144.06s)]
*  With a cigarette in his mouth. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4148.3s)]
*  Every one of those dang stitches are hand drawn. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4149.5s)]
*  I did, in fact, that side's me. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4152.62s)]
*  You did that? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4154.46s)]
*  I did the driver's side. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4154.62s)]
*  No, my friend Matt Willoughby, here's the back stone. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4155.82s)]
*  So I told him, I go, here's the idea. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4158.62s)]
*  I gave this really horrible sketch of the skull with his wraparound sunglasses. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4160.38s)]
*  And he did this piece of artwork for me with the car and the skull. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4164.7s)]
*  And when he sent the artwork, I'm like, that's not the skull. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4168.7s)]
*  Well, he faxed it to me, the idea. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4172.46s)]
*  Like his version of what I was telling him. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4176.7s)]
*  OK. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4178.46s)]
*  And the fax was like, that was, oh, it's that stretched and cool as shit, right? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4178.78s)]
*  So anyway. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4184.86s)]
*  So the fax fucked it up better. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4186.14s)]
*  The fax pulled it. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4187.5s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4189.58s)]
*  So when he flew out to put it on, I showed him the fax and he went, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4190.22s)]
*  oh my God, the fax must have dragged. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4194.06s)]
*  Because that looks almost like a wolf. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4196.78s)]
*  Yeah, kind of. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4198.86s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4199.58s)]
*  Like if that was a dude, I'd be terrified of him. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4201.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4203.26s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4203.5s)]
*  And I said, well, that's what we're using. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4204.46s)]
*  And he's like, oh, hell yeah, we are. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4206.46s)]
*  Hell yeah, that's awesome. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4207.9s)]
*  So we did that graphic. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4208.78s)]
*  Can you show me a photograph of what that looks like in perspective with the rest of the car? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4210.06s)]
*  Well, if you click on that link where you're at. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4215.5s)]
*  Just the front three quarter. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4217.9s)]
*  Not that one, just the one right next to it on the other. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4219.82s)]
*  To the right. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4224.78s)]
*  To the right. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4225.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4226.14s)]
*  You'll see it's up at the very front of the front fender. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4227.5s)]
*  It's right in the front corner. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4229.82s)]
*  It's right there. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4231.02s)]
*  Right there. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4231.82s)]
*  Show me the close up on it, Jamie, because there's a close up in one of those other photos. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4232.62s)]
*  That right there. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4237.1s)]
*  Oh, that's so sick. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4238.22s)]
*  So all the way down the car, it's just a bone, red bone pinstripe with all those hand stitches. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4239.5s)]
*  So that's Matt's stitches. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4243.66s)]
*  We only had so long. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4245.42s)]
*  We were doing the graphic overnight at a borrowed paint booth. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4247.1s)]
*  That car is so rock and roll. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4250.860000000001s)]
*  So yeah, just carbureted 360 out of a Cordoba with a warmed up cam and stuff. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4252.54s)]
*  It's straightforward. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4257.18s)]
*  That car is like a 1974 ACDC song. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4257.900000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4261.5s)]
*  Like, look at that thing. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4262.06s)]
*  God damn, that's pretty. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4263.1s)]
*  And look how pretty that is. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4264.54s)]
*  And the interior is four bucket seats and a console that goes all the way from the rear end. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4265.82s)]
*  Go back to the rear end view of it. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4270.14s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4270.78s)]
*  Yeah, cool car. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4271.900000000001s)]
*  They only made them two years, 66 and 67. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4272.7s)]
*  It's fucking gorgeous. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4275.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's neat. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4276.62s)]
*  It's gorgeous. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4277.900000000001s)]
*  I don't think I've seen one. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4279.02s)]
*  I've definitely not seen one done like this. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4280.22s)]
*  Very few and far between. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4281.18s)]
*  That's why I did it. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4282.3s)]
*  It's a perfect car to do it with because it's so pretty, man. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4283.58s)]
*  The back end of that is just fucking heavenly. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4286.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4289.58s)]
*  They're neat. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4290.3s)]
*  I enjoy them. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4291.66s)]
*  And so that was a lot of fun. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4293.1s)]
*  And then on that power tour, I met a kid named Martin Weinreb who had a black Challenger. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4295.18s)]
*  And I go, I got an idea for your car. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4300.860000000001s)]
*  And then we built the car in his driveway and it was called Challenger X. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4303.18s)]
*  And that was that big. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4307.58s)]
*  I was the first guy doing any pro touring mopars. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4309.18s)]
*  And this Challenger X was the first car to have that I knew of. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4313.26s)]
*  Street driven carbon fiber driveshaft. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4316.46s)]
*  It was like the second set of big 18 inch torque thrusts. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4319.02s)]
*  We worked with a guy named Craig Rails back at BDS for the eight stack EFI injection on [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4323.900000000001s)]
*  a small block Chrysler. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4328.860000000001s)]
*  That'll be on that on that thumb drive I gave you. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4330.54s)]
*  It's called Challenger X. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4332.9400000000005s)]
*  Right there. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4333.900000000001s)]
*  Black Challenger. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4334.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4334.9400000000005s)]
*  So that car, we took that on a power tour from here to Florida and back. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4335.66s)]
*  And there it is. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4342.22s)]
*  Yeah, pretty car. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4343.740000000001s)]
*  That's another car, the Challenger. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4344.46s)]
*  Yep. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4346.14s)]
*  That came out nice. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4346.7s)]
*  That's a 70, right? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4347.34s)]
*  72. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4349.1s)]
*  72, really? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4349.820000000001s)]
*  I did the whole interior in a tan and we built that in Martin's driveway. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4350.780000000001s)]
*  So 72 Challengers are still dope. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4355.820000000001s)]
*  72 Barracudis. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4357.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're the same as 70. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4358.3s)]
*  It's just a different bumper. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4359.26s)]
*  But 72 Barracudis got goofy. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4360.06s)]
*  You know, they started looking goofy. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4362.700000000001s)]
*  But the 72 Challengers still look sick. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4364.38s)]
*  Yeah, I did all the gauges and tan and did this whole thing in here. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4366.700000000001s)]
*  So anyway, this car, we drive it and it gets features and it gets top 10 car of the year. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4370.06s)]
*  So I've got two top 10 cars of the year and like nine or 10 features and I don't even [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4375.900000000001s)]
*  have a shop yet. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4380.14s)]
*  I've been building out of a barn, out of a tandem parking garage and somebody's driveway. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4380.860000000001s)]
*  So my batting average is doing pretty good. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4385.900000000001s)]
*  So you can get a place. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4387.9800000000005s)]
*  I finally get a place and build a couple of other stuff and I started on a Duster, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4390.22s)]
*  which we call Dustia, which was I kept the Duster lettering but made it Dustia. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4395.02s)]
*  Put that on the power tour and that car exploded. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4399.5s)]
*  It was... [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4404.14s)]
*  Let me see that because we're talking about it earlier. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4404.38s)]
*  I like a Duster. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4406.54s)]
*  Yeah, this is a really nice one. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4407.5s)]
*  It's an underappreciated car. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4408.780000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4409.9800000000005s)]
*  And what year was this Duster? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4410.3s)]
*  That was a 72. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4411.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4413.660000000001s)]
*  So those are the years that were underappreciated. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4414.06s)]
*  And we built that and I drove that again from California to Michigan. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4416.54s)]
*  Is that in your photo? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4422.3s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's in the thumb drive. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4423.26s)]
*  It's a bright old tour. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4424.78s)]
*  There's the Duster. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4425.74s)]
*  Yeah, underappreciated car. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4426.62s)]
*  So that thing had a lot of trick stuff that nobody had ever done yet on Mopar suspensions. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4429.1s)]
*  What did you do to it? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4438.46s)]
*  Well, that's a really lightweight car, right? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4439.34s)]
*  What does that weigh? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4441.34s)]
*  Probably 36 or 34. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4443.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4445.02s)]
*  But... [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4445.9s)]
*  So it's small. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4446.22s)]
*  Yep. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4447.58s)]
*  Smaller than like a 65 Mustang? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4448.78s)]
*  Like is it in the same... [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4450.46s)]
*  No, not smaller than a Mustang. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4451.18s)]
*  Nope, but light. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4452.9400000000005s)]
*  There's not a lot to them. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4453.82s)]
*  So that car, like again, I'm so fortunate. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4455.66s)]
*  Hot Rod, Mopar Muscle, all these books, it's cover, it's centerfold pullout poster, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4464.06s)]
*  it's a screensaver because that just started. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4469.18s)]
*  It's a die cast car. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4471.66s)]
*  It's top 10 car of the year. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4472.94s)]
*  So now I got three. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4474.219999999999s)]
*  It's been amazing. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4478.0599999999995s)]
*  And again, so unbelievably fortunate that... [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4479.66s)]
*  You're talented, man. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4483.66s)]
*  You keep saying fortunate. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4484.62s)]
*  But you know what? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4485.74s)]
*  I mean, it is certainly fortunate, but it's also hard work. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4486.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is hard work. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4489.5s)]
*  So at that point, I was living in the shop. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4491.0199999999995s)]
*  I didn't have money for an apartment. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4494.86s)]
*  So my bed was next to my lift and I had a piece of plastic that I threw over the bed. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4497.0199999999995s)]
*  So the rust and oil and everything else wouldn't get on my bed. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4502.299999999999s)]
*  And then I joined a 24-hour fitness. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4505.5s)]
*  So I had somewhere to shower. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4507.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4509.66s)]
*  How many people have done that? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4509.98s)]
*  Well, I don't know if they're as stupid as me, but I did it. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4512.46s)]
*  A lot of people do that when they're living out of their cars. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4516.219999999999s)]
*  A lot of comedians did that. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4517.98s)]
*  Got a membership of 24-hour fitness, slept in their car. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4519.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was sleeping in the shop. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4521.58s)]
*  So that car really launched stuff. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4524.62s)]
*  And I got a phone call. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4529.26s)]
*  That car, by the way, Reggie Jackson still owns it. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4532.54s)]
*  He bought it off the guy who built it for me. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4535.18s)]
*  Still owns it. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4536.86s)]
*  Reggie Jackson might be like the biggest hot rod collector. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4537.26s)]
*  Yeah, he lost a lot in the fire about 20 years ago. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4539.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4542.46s)]
*  Lost buildings worth. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4542.78s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4544.38s)]
*  So anyway, the guy that I built that car for, Romeo Furio, that's his real name. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4546.54s)]
*  He wanted to do another car. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4554.06s)]
*  And I just came back from showering with 30 strangers at 24-hour fitness. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4556.14s)]
*  And I'm having my bowl of Cheerios. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4563.82s)]
*  My phone rings. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4565.42s)]
*  And it's this gentleman named David Hakim and a couple of other big wig gentlemen from [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4566.14s)]
*  Mopar Performance from Chrysler. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4573.58s)]
*  We've been watching what you've been doing. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4576.14s)]
*  We want to be synonymous with pure vision. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4577.82s)]
*  Here's the catalog. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4580.78s)]
*  Next time you build something, whatever you want, let us know. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4581.9800000000005s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4585.02s)]
*  And we built a car, or I built a car, I was still basically alone, called GTXR. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4585.900000000001s)]
*  I had a fantastic painter named Russ Stevenson that put up with me [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4593.34s)]
*  at that time. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4597.580000000001s)]
*  Now I have Mick Jenkins, who is just beyond incredible. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4598.38s)]
*  We'll get to that in a second. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4602.38s)]
*  But on GTXR, I wanted to use the big body satellite that nobody ever uses and nobody likes. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4603.42s)]
*  Can I see what that looks like? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4613.1s)]
*  And they're very swoopy like Ferraris. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4613.82s)]
*  They go like they're coke-bottled, but the way they sat stock is they look like an elephant [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4615.5s)]
*  on stilts. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4619.98s)]
*  There you go. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4620.62s)]
*  Oh, that's a cool car. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4621.099999999999s)]
*  So this was my first time ever at SEMA. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4622.219999999999s)]
*  Is that an AMG? [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4624.86s)]
*  Is that what that is? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4625.74s)]
*  No, it's a Plymouth satellite. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4626.46s)]
*  That's a Plymouth. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4628.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4629.42s)]
*  God, that's a wild-looking car. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4631.74s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4633.179999999999s)]
*  You don't see very many of those either. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4634.0599999999995s)]
*  No, because no one cared. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4635.099999999999s)]
*  And these things were so curvy. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4636.62s)]
*  I got a great story about that shot, the Mopar, the one with the blue [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4637.98s)]
*  blue sky behind it. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4643.02s)]
*  With the blue sky, Jamie? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4646.3s)]
*  Right in the middle, almost. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4647.42s)]
*  The photo with the blue sky? [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4648.62s)]
*  Yeah, the odd one. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4649.58s)]
*  No, right there. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4650.46s)]
*  Yeah, that one. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4651.1s)]
*  So I'm getting ready. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4653.02s)]
*  I'm thrashing to get the thing done to go to SEMA. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4654.06s)]
*  I've never been to SEMA before, and I'm unveiling the car in Chrysler's berth on a turntable. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4656.38s)]
*  First time there. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4663.18s)]
*  So this is like just cracking. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4664.3s)]
*  Six in the morning, we had already driven from in the truck and trailer. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4667.1s)]
*  What year is this? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4671.1s)]
*  When did I do that? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4673.1s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4674.14s)]
*  That's why I have my notes. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4674.54s)]
*  Just take a guess. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4675.74s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4676.860000000001s)]
*  Why? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4677.66s)]
*  I like how you went with the fat tires in the rear. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4679.18s)]
*  2003. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4681.1s)]
*  I get really sad when I see a muscle car with skinny rear tires. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4682.14s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4685.18s)]
*  Always big old tire. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4685.66s)]
*  So this is when you're coming down the grade into Vegas, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4687.5s)]
*  and before there was nothing over to the right. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4693.02s)]
*  Now it's all houses and everything all the way to Henderson. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4697.02s)]
*  Before there was nothing there. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4700.14s)]
*  This is when the roads were paved and there wasn't one building put up. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4701.820000000001s)]
*  And the photographer is in a ditch that is like five feet deep for the what will be the plumbing [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4706.38s)]
*  and all that stuff. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4713.66s)]
*  And he's sitting there. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4715.18s)]
*  His name was Randy Bulligan. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4716.14s)]
*  I remember him because again, no digital cameras. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4717.26s)]
*  It was right. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4720.06s)]
*  Hey, like how he did that. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4722.06s)]
*  So almost sounded like it. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4723.5s)]
*  No, it was horrible. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4724.54s)]
*  Anyway, I hear him go cover. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4725.820000000001s)]
*  They're like, oh, that's cool. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4729.1s)]
*  So that car was the world's first paddle shifted muscle car. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4731.18s)]
*  I created the paddle shifts in it. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4735.740000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4737.820000000001s)]
*  At that time, the only there's one shot that I put on the thumb drive. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4738.46s)]
*  Again, I don't know if you have that in, but there's an interior shot. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4742.860000000001s)]
*  So what kind of transmission at the time? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4746.700000000001s)]
*  There was the brand new truck 518 for four speed overdrive that was in the brand new [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4750.9400000000005s)]
*  pickup trucks for 2002, 2003. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4755.740000000001s)]
*  Overdrive was becoming a new thing. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4759.1s)]
*  So there you go. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4761.740000000001s)]
*  So I made I had a really amazing billet guy. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4763.26s)]
*  He did the intakes on that. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4766.860000000001s)]
*  We'll look at the motor in a second and those paddles. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4768.46s)]
*  I made everything out of wood first and those work micro switches in the inside the column, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4771.02s)]
*  the factory column and underneath. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4777.02s)]
*  See others three horn buttons, the little pads underneath the right one up at three o'clock. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4779.660000000001s)]
*  There's a micro switch under that now. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4785.58s)]
*  And so the I use the company called Deiden Bear that made pneumatic shifters for drag racing. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4787.42s)]
*  OK, OK, because it immediately shifts. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4794.38s)]
*  It's hooked up to a computer. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4797.1s)]
*  So all I did and it's air that you know, that like the CO2 guns and air cartridge. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4799.1s)]
*  Yeah, one of those are in the trunk. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4804.7s)]
*  And it runs the this celluloid that is attached to a BNM ratchet shifter. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4807.9800000000005s)]
*  So you can never skip a gear, right? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4814.9400000000005s)]
*  Bim bam bam. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4816.46s)]
*  And they are hooked up. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4817.9800000000005s)]
*  So shift up pulls back. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4819.26s)]
*  I called Dean Bear and I said, can you make me one that pushes and pulls? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4821.66s)]
*  They're like, sure. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4825.9800000000005s)]
*  So up shift, down shift. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4827.66s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4829.34s)]
*  And then this button under the horn, I use the horn circuit that turns the overdrive on and off. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4829.66s)]
*  So you have highway second, third overdrive or second there in the canyon. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4834.86s)]
*  So where's the horn now? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4838.54s)]
*  There's no horn. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4841.26s)]
*  Fuck the horn. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4842.94s)]
*  He gave up the horn. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4843.66s)]
*  Yeah, nobody cared. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4844.62s)]
*  So I had like every executive because the shifter moves while you're hitting the paddles [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4846.0599999999995s)]
*  because the ratchets because the CO2 is working it. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4851.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4854.219999999999s)]
*  I owe it to the end of the first day. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4854.54s)]
*  We had to go refill the bottle, which was like that point. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4856.38s)]
*  Seventy five cents. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4860.46s)]
*  It's good for about 200 shifts, but it was fully functioning and working and worked fantastic. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4861.74s)]
*  And it was actually foolproof because even if you ran out of CO2, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4867.74s)]
*  just grab shifter, put it in drive and drive it around. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4871.179999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4873.66s)]
*  So it only replied to when you wanted to. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4874.22s)]
*  Yeah, when you wanted to. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4876.06s)]
*  Yeah, but it worked really good. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4877.42s)]
*  The problem was nobody had a shift kit. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4878.54s)]
*  So the transmission couldn't shift as fast as because I turned the wick up, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4880.22s)]
*  turned the pressure up and it would go, bam, bam. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4883.58s)]
*  I mean, it shift right fricking now. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4885.740000000001s)]
*  And then the transmission would be like, well, no, it, it, it catch up eventually. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4887.900000000001s)]
*  But they then place like Fairbanks and other companies started making shift kits. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4894.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4898.54s)]
*  You don't make normal cars. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4898.7s)]
*  You really overcomplicate your life. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4900.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4902.219999999999s)]
*  I do with things like that. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4902.78s)]
*  So you move forward from that car and then I built a car called Hammer and that was a [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4904.0599999999995s)]
*  road runner. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4910.78s)]
*  That was the first one I saw. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4911.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4912.7s)]
*  And Hammer was in my actually it was in the same. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4912.86s)]
*  It was a season later on rides. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4917.179999999999s)]
*  They followed me building my car like they followed Sickfish because you were first season. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4919.259999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4924.379999999999s)]
*  It was the first episode of the first season. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4925.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4926.86s)]
*  Because you're fancy. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4927.419999999999s)]
*  No, I don't think I was on the first season. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4928.54s)]
*  It was on the first season. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4930.7s)]
*  I thought you were. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4931.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4932.7s)]
*  I think there was other. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4933.26s)]
*  I don't know if I was in the, I definitely don't think I was the first episode. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4934.7s)]
*  So built Hammer and that was, you know, I had an interior guy who didn't show up the [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4937.0199999999995s)]
*  night before SEMA and a whole bunch of disaster and showed up to see my day late. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4941.9s)]
*  And which was also fantastic because everybody, the rumor was around that this car being filmed [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4947.74s)]
*  was late and it may or may not show up. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4954.62s)]
*  And, and we got there and. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4956.54s)]
*  So that was my first rides episode. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4961.5s)]
*  And then about a, there she is. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4963.98s)]
*  There she is. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4966.139999999999s)]
*  My God. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4966.7s)]
*  So that thing still holds up. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4967.58s)]
*  That is owned by the gentleman who owns Traxxas, the radio controlled empire. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4968.78s)]
*  When I went to your shop, that was there the first time I went to the shop. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4973.42s)]
*  It's a lovely car. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4976.46s)]
*  It still looks good. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4977.82s)]
*  Of course it looks good. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4979.0199999999995s)]
*  How could it not look good? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4980.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4981.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4981.42s)]
*  It still looks like that. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4981.66s)]
*  It does look like it. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4983.74s)]
*  That thing spawned a million copies. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4984.94s)]
*  God, it's so pretty. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4987.9s)]
*  So that's even better. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4990.06s)]
*  So that's even better than the other one. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4991.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=4994.14s)]

*  Wow. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5021.9s)]

*  Oh, yes. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5032.7s)]
*  And I copied across the back on those cars, they have the individual letters, Plymouth, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5034.62s)]
*  P-L-Y-M, right? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5040.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5041.66s)]
*  So I copied the font and had letters made that spelled hammer. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5041.98s)]
*  And then made a new set on the dash. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5045.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5047.66s)]

*  right above your cursor. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5166.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5168.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5168.46s)]
*  At the red carpet. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5168.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5169.660000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5169.820000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5171.26s)]
*  Sharp car. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5171.900000000001s)]
*  God, it's gorgeous. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5172.540000000001s)]
*  So that obviously did wonders and that was like 2005, 2006. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5173.900000000001s)]
*  Had a bunch of other really cool stuff and then we built the Anvil Mustang. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5180.14s)]
*  We helped develop all the carbon fiber pieces for a company called Anvil. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5186.46s)]
*  And we unveiled the car at SEMA in 2010. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5191.1s)]
*  And I knew we had a really good car. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5195.740000000001s)]
*  It's all cantilever push ride inboard suspension like an F1 car. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5199.34s)]
*  And we wide bodied it, except you can't tell unless it's [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5203.660000000001s)]
*  sitting next to a stock one. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5207.1s)]
*  We actually bowed the quarter panels. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5208.3s)]
*  So at the door and at the tail lights, it's stock. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5209.9800000000005s)]
*  Pull that up, Jamie. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5213.740000000001s)]
*  Curves up. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5214.38s)]
*  There it is. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5216.540000000001s)]
*  There it is. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5217.040000000001s)]
*  Another thing. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5217.820000000001s)]
*  So lots of work done to that thing. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5219.18s)]
*  The whole nose is all carbon fiber and it's widened and changed. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5221.42s)]
*  Tail panels changed. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5226.06s)]
*  I did it like a front there. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5227.26s)]
*  You can see the cantilever inboard suspension there. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5228.22s)]
*  The coilover's laid down. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5231.740000000001s)]
*  I must handle like a motherfucker, huh? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5232.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5234.62s)]
*  It's a lovely car. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5235.02s)]
*  And that's the rear seat area. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5235.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the inboard. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5238.06s)]
*  That's a Meyers rear. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5239.42s)]
*  And everything's on quick pins so you can literally snap, take out the coilovers, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5240.860000000001s)]
*  put in a different set of shocks. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5244.46s)]
*  Do not stick your fingers in there, kids. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5245.26s)]
*  No bad. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5247.02s)]
*  While the car is driving, do not stick your finger in there. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5247.66s)]
*  It is fantastic to watch in the rear view mirror. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5249.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5251.82s)]
*  It must be amazing. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5252.3s)]
*  You're sitting there watching the stuff work and you're like, oh, I gotta be driving. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5253.18s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5255.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5256.22s)]
*  Just don't have a gym bag back there. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5256.38s)]
*  Yeah, bad. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5257.9s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5259.0199999999995s)]
*  Look at that interior. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5259.66s)]
*  So that's gorgeous. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5261.0199999999995s)]
*  That's a perfect interior for that car. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5263.42s)]
*  And a lot of the time spent, see that down bar going down through the roll bar? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5265.42s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5268.94s)]
*  That does not touch you when you're in the passenger seat. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5269.18s)]
*  Really? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5271.42s)]
*  Touches nobody. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5271.82s)]
*  So it's- [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5273.18s)]
*  What if you're a big guy? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5273.9s)]
*  There's a lot of room. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5275.74s)]
*  But that comes out to that bolts and unbolts. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5277.34s)]
*  So yeah, little switches and handles and whatnot. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5280.0599999999995s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5285.58s)]
*  Does the guy who has this drive it? [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5286.22s)]
*  Yeah, as far as I know. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5287.9s)]
*  He's gotta drive this. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5289.179999999999s)]
*  So it won- [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5290.62s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5292.0599999999995s)]
*  That is so gorgeous, man. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5293.0199999999995s)]
*  It won the Ford Design Award Car of the Show at SEMA, which was- [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5294.94s)]
*  That's a 69, right? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5298.62s)]
*  Yes, you're correct, sir. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5300.0599999999995s)]
*  It might be the most gorgeous 69 I've ever seen. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5301.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, lots done. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5303.0199999999995s)]
*  Again, nothing stocks. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5303.82s)]
*  Everything's- [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5306.7s)]
*  That fucking suspension setup in the back seat. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5307.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that was cool. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5309.9s)]
*  Gives me a childhood boner. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5310.7s)]
*  Okay, good. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5312.139999999999s)]
*  So that- [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5315.5s)]
*  All this stuff comes back to when you're kids, right? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5316.46s)]
*  Heck yeah. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5318.54s)]
*  Hot wheels. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5320.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, hot wheels and what the cool cars were in your neighborhood. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5320.86s)]
*  Which that- there's a miracle for me. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5323.74s)]
*  In 2005 or so, I'm in an airport. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5326.219999999999s)]
*  And before it, when I was building Scully, the silver car, 97-ish, I left the job I was working [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5331.5s)]
*  and went working for a gentleman named Bruce Schultz. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5340.860000000001s)]
*  And he did sublet work for Mattel and Action Diecast. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5344.860000000001s)]
*  And we did prototypes. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5349.42s)]
*  It was before there was Rapid Prototype Anything. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5350.860000000001s)]
*  So you'd get a drawing from the Mattel crazy hot wheel designer. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5352.78s)]
*  It's like, make this. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5356.860000000001s)]
*  Or we'd get some and go, here we need these 25 stripped and painted a different color [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5358.299999999999s)]
*  and different graphics for Toy Fair. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5365.0199999999995s)]
*  So when I worked for Bruce, I met a guy named Kelly Cox. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5367.0199999999995s)]
*  Mr. Kelly Cox, who as of right now is going on, it's like his 18th or 19th year as an [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5371.98s)]
*  employee for me. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5377.34s)]
*  We became really good friends working together. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5378.86s)]
*  We found out we love the same music. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5380.62s)]
*  We have the same sense of humor. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5382.139999999999s)]
*  And so I met Kelly working for Bruce and I was building that. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5384.06s)]
*  When I built that charger, I drove it over to Bruce's house because I'd met him like [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5389.82s)]
*  a year before. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5394.14s)]
*  And I said, hey, look what I did because he saw the car I started with. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5394.7s)]
*  And he goes, you did that? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5397.26s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5398.78s)]
*  He goes, can you build model cars? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5399.34s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5400.86s)]
*  He's like, want to work here? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5402.38s)]
*  I'm like, where? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5404.14s)]
*  He goes, here in my garage. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5405.26s)]
*  This is what we do. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5406.7s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5407.42s)]
*  And he goes, how much do you make working for Chrysler? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5408.62s)]
*  And I go, X. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5411.82s)]
*  He goes, I'll promise you X and you can make Y. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5413.02s)]
*  I'm like, I'm quitting tomorrow. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5416.14s)]
*  So I'm just in this guy's garage building model. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5418.700000000001s)]
*  Basically, I'm oversimplifying, but building super cool one-off model stuff for [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5421.02s)]
*  Mattel and Hot Wheels. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5425.660000000001s)]
*  That's 97, right? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5427.1s)]
*  90, 98 going into 99. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5428.9400000000005s)]
*  Fast forward 2005. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5431.42s)]
*  My shop is now up and running. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5433.34s)]
*  I've had a bunch of magazine features. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5435.740000000001s)]
*  I'm at an airport and one of the guys I worked at Mattel was in the airport too. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5437.42s)]
*  I recognize him because I used to be down there all the time bringing in prototypes. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5442.22s)]
*  And I'm joking with him and I'm like, hey, man, how many super cool features do I [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5446.7s)]
*  got to have before I can get a Hot Wheels made in one of my cars? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5450.38s)]
*  And he goes, you know what? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5453.740000000001s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5454.54s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, that's a good idea. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5455.18s)]
*  I was joking with him. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5458.9400000000005s)]
*  So they had a new line of your normal Hot Wheels are 1 to 64th scale. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5460.46s)]
*  They were going to try this new thing with like 1 to 50th scale. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5465.34s)]
*  They're going to call them G machines. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5467.66s)]
*  And they're like, we'll do a 12 car line with you. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5469.02s)]
*  You create the paint scheme and then this and then that. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5471.66s)]
*  But we have X amount of little wheels you can use. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5474.54s)]
*  An X amount of this and that. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5478.54s)]
*  Well, that worked for both of us because I know working with them. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5480.0599999999995s)]
*  I understand the cost of extra stripes never cost money. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5483.74s)]
*  So I know how to make a car simple and that one a little more elaborate. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5488.7s)]
*  And then the budget balances out. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5491.82s)]
*  I understood all that already. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5493.9s)]
*  So I went down, had a designer group meeting and I got a 12 car line. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5495.5s)]
*  That in the back window of every car, it's got my Pure Vision logo. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5500.7s)]
*  Now, in the back of the box, it says Pure Vision, the premier hot rod shop in Southern California. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5504.62s)]
*  These went global. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5508.7s)]
*  And I mean, it's the hugest honor. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5510.7s)]
*  It's an unbelievable opportunity that I still and like pinching myself that that even happened. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5513.179999999999s)]
*  And so that was an amazing opportunity working at Bruce's. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5519.5s)]
*  It got me having a toy line later and having my guy that's been with me forever, Kelly, working for me. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5526.46s)]
*  So I was very fortunate again that the stars lined up that way. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5535.02s)]
*  That's great, man. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5539.82s)]
*  It's not fortune, though. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5540.46s)]
*  It's talent. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5541.26s)]
*  Well, you have an eye for cars. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5541.82s)]

*  But it's an art form, you know, and you're an artist in other ways. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5544.7s)]
*  You know, you play music, your guy creates things. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5547.34s)]
*  That's what I think is so interesting about your cars is that you don't just like make a cool car. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5550.54s)]

*  What's happening here? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5767.52s)]
*  Photo shoot probably. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5768.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5771.2s)]
*  Why are they showing that? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5771.68s)]
*  Show me that goddamn car. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5772.8s)]
*  Stop trying to distract me. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5773.92s)]
*  They just want to keep you looking. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5775.76s)]
*  They figure you're only going to look at that car for about 45 seconds. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5777.76s)]
*  That's my day. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5780.24s)]
*  Throwing a hot lady in a bikini and now we got you. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5780.88s)]
*  Sorry, is she still on? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5783.12s)]
*  She's still on the screen. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5784.48s)]
*  Where's the fucking car? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5785.759999999999s)]
*  Where's the fucking car? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5787.12s)]
*  That left her. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5788.32s)]
*  There she is again. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5789.2s)]
*  That's it. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5790.48s)]
*  She's a wild one too. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5791.36s)]
*  Tattooed up. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5792.24s)]
*  Oh, great. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5793.04s)]
*  That's what you want. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5793.919999999999s)]
*  If you want a car like that, you want a lady like that. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5794.639999999999s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5796.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the dream. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5797.04s)]
*  Cam's selling the dream. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5798.0s)]
*  Oh, is that what he's doing? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5799.28s)]
*  He's selling the dream. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5800.4s)]
*  OK, the dream. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5801.28s)]
*  Don't you see? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5802.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I saw it. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5803.44s)]
*  That car's wild though. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5804.24s)]
*  Huh? [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5805.12s)]
*  Sounds healthy. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5805.679999999999s)]
*  Show me some extra images of that car. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5806.32s)]
*  It's a, yeah. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5808.4s)]
*  So that car too influenced my decision. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5809.12s)]
*  No. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5811.5199999999995s)]
*  So I don't know if that car was like during the time we had [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5812.42s)]
*  already decided on a Nova though, because this guy built that a few years back. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5815.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5819.38s)]
*  I'm unfamiliar with it. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5820.820000000001s)]
*  It's pretty, man. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5821.9400000000005s)]
*  It's good. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5822.740000000001s)]
*  Pretty. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5823.240000000001s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5824.34s)]
*  It's a little taller rear tire, but that's me. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5824.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5827.22s)]
*  That's an older school way of rubber band. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5828.18s)]
*  I want to say, hey, man, everyone does their own thing. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5830.740000000001s)]
*  But early 2000s, they were doing a lot of that. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5832.820000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5834.9800000000005s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5835.38s)]
*  Lord, that's beautiful. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5837.780000000001s)]
*  Big old hood. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5840.1s)]
*  Yeah, beautiful car. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5841.06s)]
*  I think it's a twin turbo. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5841.9400000000005s)]
*  If I remember correctly. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5842.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it sounded like I was hearing the waste gates pop when he was doing acceleration. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5843.38s)]
*  Click, yeah. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5846.9800000000005s)]
*  Click on that image of right there where your cursor is. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5847.38s)]
*  Right there. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5849.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look at that fucking thing. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5850.34s)]
*  God, that's gorgeous. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5854.26s)]
*  But it drives me nuts when people don't put side view mirrors. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5855.46s)]
*  It doesn't make the car look bad, but you should see where the fuck you're going. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5858.18s)]
*  Or where you were. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5861.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, or what's coming up. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5863.54s)]
*  What the hell? [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5865.22s)]
*  If you're changing lanes. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5865.46s)]
*  Where the officers are? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5866.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5867.700000000001s)]
*  Put a fucking side view mirror on, kids. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5868.02s)]
*  It does not make the car look ugly. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5870.42s)]
*  That became a trend for a while, where people would have completely shaved mirrors. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5872.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5875.3s)]
*  You know? [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5876.66s)]
*  You had asked me what's new. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5878.74s)]
*  And you know what? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5881.7s)]
*  I'll have to give you, because I have nothing up. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5884.02s)]
*  I'll give you so you guys can get it in post. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5887.06s)]
*  No, I've got three cars that are humdingers. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5892.58s)]
*  I got a road runner coming out called Haraka. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5896.26s)]
*  Which is African for speed. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5900.5s)]
*  And it's quite the piece. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5905.3s)]
*  Is that done? [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5908.18s)]
*  We're going to unveil it next year at SEMA. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5909.78s)]
*  What stage is it in now? [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5912.9s)]
*  Bare metal and heavy fab. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5915.7s)]
*  You got any images? [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5918.18s)]
*  I will supply you images. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5919.62s)]
*  Is that it right there? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5921.7s)]
*  That day is like a cell phone from the 60s. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5923.22s)]
*  What the hell is that? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5925.7s)]
*  Time machine cell phone. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5926.66s)]
*  How'd you even get that? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5927.06s)]
*  What is that? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5928.26s)]
*  I know what it is. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5929.78s)]
*  It might have been like an Instagram. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5930.5s)]
*  It's a TikTok video. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5932.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, or something. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5933.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, that's hilarious. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5933.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's way beyond that stage. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5934.42s)]
*  Road runner is another car that's a very cool car. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5937.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes. This one is going to be something. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5938.74s)]
*  You know what someone should do? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5942.259999999999s)]
*  Someone should redo Blade's 69 Charger from the movie Blade. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5943.78s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5951.54s)]
*  I think it was a 69. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5953.219999999999s)]
*  It's definitely a late 60s Charger. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5954.58s)]
*  Blade, you know, the vampire hunter? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5956.98s)]
*  Drove around in a Charger when he was killing people. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5959.46s)]
*  It's a 68. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5962.099999999999s)]
*  68. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5962.98s)]
*  Yeah, similar body style. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5963.86s)]
*  There it is right there. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5964.98s)]
*  Look at that car right there. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5965.54s)]
*  Somebody needs to redo that because Blade had like... [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5966.74s)]
*  That's not hard. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5968.9s)]
*  Blade had a souped... [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5969.78s)]
*  But I mean a really good one, like a really well done one. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5971.3s)]
*  Easy. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5974.0199999999995s)]
*  Blade had a souped up Charger. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5974.5s)]
*  Look at it. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5976.34s)]
*  That's what he drove around in. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5977.94s)]
*  Someone should make like a Blade themed... [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5980.18s)]
*  Again, that's just a Charger with auto drags on it or center line. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5983.139999999999s)]
*  But it doesn't have to look exactly like that, but a Blade themed 69 Charger. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5987.139999999999s)]
*  If he had one that went through your shop, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5992.58s)]
*  if Blade came to your shop, he said, I want to kill vampires. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5994.9s)]
*  Oh, good. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5998.259999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5999.0599999999995s)]
*  Like what would you build them? [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=5999.86s)]
*  I'll send you guys the artwork, but that's the road runner right now. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6000.98s)]
*  But it's more than... [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6005.379999999999s)]
*  Why are you trying to change the subject? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6006.419999999999s)]
*  Because. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6007.94s)]
*  We're talking about Blade. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6008.259999999999s)]
*  If Blade came to you right now and wanted to make a 68 Charger... [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6010.0199999999995s)]
*  Fine, I'll do him a Charger. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6012.74s)]
*  I'll do him a Charger. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6013.94s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6014.98s)]
*  Which if he's trying to run from vampires, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6015.94s)]
*  how well could you get a 68, 69 Charger to handle? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6018.0199999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of front end sheet metal. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6022.9s)]
*  There's stuff available now that... [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6024.98s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6027.62s)]
*  Not... Yeah, there's plenty of stuff. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6028.0199999999995s)]
*  What could you do to balance it out? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6029.62s)]
*  In fact, on this road runner, I have a brand new suspension from Heights. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6031.86s)]
*  That's an IFS and IRS from... [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6039.299999999999s)]
*  Well, I just said from Heights. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6041.54s)]
*  Let's explain to people. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6043.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck we're talking about. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6043.94s)]
*  Independent front suspension. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6045.379999999999s)]
*  Independent front suspension, yes. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6047.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6048.58s)]
*  So it's really trick stuff and it's brand new for them. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6050.339999999999s)]
*  What about like a rear transaxle to balance out the weight? [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6053.94s)]
*  You could, even though the road runners weren't super heavy. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6057.86s)]
*  They're about 3,600 pounds. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6061.86s)]
*  Right, but the Charger? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6063.86s)]
*  Oh, the Charger. Same thing. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6065.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a B-body. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6066.099999999999s)]
*  Basically the same body. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6067.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same thing. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6067.94s)]
*  So they weren't that heavy? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6069.299999999999s)]
*  They were how heavy? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6070.5s)]
*  About 38. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6071.62s)]
*  3800? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6072.74s)]
*  That's pretty heavy. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6073.3s)]
*  Or so. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6074.099999999999s)]
*  What did you think of that one that someone built that they made all carbon? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6075.7s)]
*  Did you ever see that? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6078.74s)]
*  Yes, I'm familiar. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6079.7s)]
*  They've done quite a few of them. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6081.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, was it SpeedCore? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6082.5s)]
*  Is that what SpeedCore? [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6083.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6084.26s)]
*  Let's see if we can find that SpeedCore carbon charger. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6085.38s)]
*  Cool piece for sure. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6087.78s)]
*  That probably drives great because of the lightweight... [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6088.98s)]
*  Oh, and it's on a brand new modern chassis. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6091.78s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6094.66s)]
*  Yeah, billet, probably the grill's billet or... [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6095.86s)]
*  Ooh, an all carbon fiber exterior. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6098.9800000000005s)]
*  So the body sits down over the chassis and that's how it sits that low. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6103.54s)]
*  What do you think that thing weighs? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6106.42s)]
*  A lot less, but probably not a lot less that you think because parts still weigh. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6108.26s)]
*  Right, of course. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6113.3s)]
*  So like just removing the steel and replacing it with carbon, save 500 pounds? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6114.58s)]
*  Yeah, it might be low 3000s, like 31, 32, which is... [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6120.820000000001s)]
*  That's probably amazing then. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6126.34s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6128.5s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6130.5s)]
*  Where are you going to park that? [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6131.54s)]
*  Somewhere. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6134.74s)]
*  You'd be terrified. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6135.7s)]
*  Somewhere safe. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6136.18s)]
*  You'd be terrified of someone dinging your doors. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6136.9800000000005s)]
*  You got a goddamn carbon fiber car. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6139.54s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6141.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're not pounding the dents out. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6142.58s)]
*  Yeah, what do you do if you get in an accident in a carbon fiber car? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6144.5s)]
*  They have to refab completely new panels for you? [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6147.54s)]
*  You either put a new one on or probably... [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6149.62s)]
*  Well, it depends if it's the quarter panel that might be a problem. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6151.9400000000005s)]
*  Like if you get hit in the fender, you replace the fender. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6154.820000000001s)]
*  If you get hit in the rear, they probably have to redo your whole car. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6157.3s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's kind of like expensive fiberglass surgery. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6160.1s)]
*  You can buy rear bumpers at least. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6164.66s)]
*  So you can buy a carbon fiber charger bumper. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6166.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but the bumper is not what I'm worried about. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6171.3s)]
*  I'm worried about the quarter panels, the roof, you know, because if you get somebody [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6173.06s)]
*  rear ends you or hits you from the side, it's going to fuck up all that stuff. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6176.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6181.38s)]
*  I guess he can't think about that. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6182.5s)]
*  No. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6183.860000000001s)]
*  He just has to be cool driving around. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6184.1s)]
*  Yep. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6185.9400000000005s)]
*  They're doing that with quite a few hot rods now, right? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6186.66s)]
*  Like I know there's a company that makes classic recreations. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6189.38s)]
*  They're doing a Camaro. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6192.42s)]
*  They do a complete carbon fiber GT 500. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6193.38s)]
*  You've seen that, right? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6196.9s)]
*  Or someone doing the GT? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6197.78s)]
*  Older one? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6199.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, 67 GT 500. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6200.099999999999s)]
*  Carbon? [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6202.42s)]
*  Classic recreations is doing it. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6202.98s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6204.34s)]
*  I know there's a guy that's doing the... [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6205.38s)]
*  They do the charger. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6208.18s)]
*  That one. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6210.42s)]
*  And there's a 69 Camaro. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6212.74s)]
*  That's all carbon. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6214.34s)]
*  So see what it looks like. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6216.34s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6218.1s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6223.46s)]
*  Yep. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6224.82s)]
*  That's probably very light, right? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6225.14s)]
*  Well, it's again... [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6227.14s)]
*  Because that's an even smaller car, right? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6227.94s)]
*  It's going to be lighter. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6229.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6230.18s)]
*  Yeah, the Mustang is lighter and smaller. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6230.58s)]
*  67, right? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6233.94s)]
*  If you had to guess, what do you think that thing weighs? [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6235.3s)]
*  I bet you it's still around 3000 or so. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6237.22s)]
*  Again, I'm... [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6239.22s)]
*  Right, but 3000 pounds. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6240.34s)]
*  It depends what engine, it depends what suspension, it depends... [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6240.82s)]
*  Everything. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6244.9s)]
*  It says... [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6245.7s)]
*  Scroll up a little bit. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6246.5s)]
*  It's interesting that all the carbon companies that are doing this don't talk about a weight. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6247.7s)]
*  Keep going, Jamie. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6251.379999999999s)]
*  It's at the top of the page so I can see what it said. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6252.099999999999s)]
*  It was saying something about the horsepower. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6254.66s)]
*  Oh, they do a turnkey car? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6258.82s)]
*  You might have been hovering over the engine part of it. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6261.7s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6264.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, 545 horsepower. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6264.82s)]
*  So it's a 427 crate engine. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6266.419999999999s)]
*  Which is probably all you need if it's that light. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6270.74s)]
*  Oh, it's more than fine for a driver on the street. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6273.54s)]
*  That's got to be amazing. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6276.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, you can do a Coyote Gen 3 with a supercharger that's 770 horsepower. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6278.5s)]
*  If you're a fucking psycho, right? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6283.22s)]
*  If you're a fucking psycho, unquote. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6287.3s)]
*  If you're a fucking psycho and you want a carbon fiber car that weighs nothing. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6288.82s)]
*  If you're just greedy, you know. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6292.26s)]
*  770 horsepower. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6293.54s)]
*  That'll probably get you to the store on time without much difficulty. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6294.9s)]
*  You ain't going to the store on that. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6299.86s)]
*  Oh, why not? [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6301.0599999999995s)]
*  Putting groceries in the back. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6302.26s)]
*  Let's live dangerously. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6303.3s)]
*  Go to Ralph's. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6304.74s)]
*  Yeah, I bet some people do with it. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6305.78s)]
*  I'm sure there's people that take their hot rods around as daily drivers. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6309.0599999999995s)]
*  I met a guy once in... [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6313.22s)]
*  I drive mine. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6314.9s)]
*  Every day? [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6316.34s)]
*  Not every day. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6317.22s)]
*  I have to use my truck too. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6318.26s)]
*  What are you driving? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6319.46s)]
*  Normally, I use my work truck. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6321.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but when you're not driving to work. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6322.58s)]
*  I got a really fun little... [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6324.98s)]
*  Which I can't... [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6326.9s)]
*  Who did I put on the thumb drive? [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6328.26s)]
*  I have a 64 Olds little Cutlass that I built for cross-country driving. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6329.94s)]
*  So it's got modern air conditioning, like vintage air and dynamite sound deadening. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6334.58s)]
*  And I have these really wonderful seats from a Porsche Panamera. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6339.3s)]
*  Cut seven inches off of it. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6343.62s)]
*  And it's got... [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6345.54s)]
*  They're like 18-way powered. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6346.58s)]
*  Show me pictures. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6347.86s)]
*  Heated and cool. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6348.58s)]
*  Do I have anything on there? [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6349.94s)]
*  No, I have a 64 Fury. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6351.86s)]
*  Nope. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6354.74s)]
*  That's a brand new Fury. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6355.86s)]
*  We just finished that. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6357.299999999999s)]
*  Do you have it on your website? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6358.9s)]
*  Nope, that's not up yet either. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6360.82s)]

*  Oh, okay. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6366.179999999999s)]
*  How could we see that then? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6366.9s)]
*  Was it rides? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6369.46s)]
*  Was it an episode of rides? [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6370.099999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6370.98s)]
*  Your TV show. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6371.38s)]
*  Oh, that TV show. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6372.42s)]

*  Basically a Ferrari Saddle Tan. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6386.98s)]
*  Pretty much a daily driver. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6388.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing I put around in. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6390.58s)]

*  Hi there, island Jamie. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6423.7s)]
*  What are you doing, Jamie? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6424.66s)]
*  Because I'm an island. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6425.38s)]
*  Oh. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6426.1s)]

*  Do you know your old songs? [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6430.66s)]
*  He's not an island boy. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6432.42s)]
*  You're a rock, you're an island, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6433.06s)]
*  as Paul Simon would say. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6434.42s)]

*  He can just do whatever I ask him. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6464.34s)]
*  And then a new kid named Tommy. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6467.22s)]
*  I do got to throw out all those big deal cars. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6468.66s)]
*  There was the Anvil that you looked at. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6471.860000000001s)]
*  And then we didn't have a year off. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6474.34s)]
*  We had a couple others we finished. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6476.9s)]
*  And then we did a car called the Martini Mustang [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6478.34s)]
*  that we went to SEMA. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6483.46s)]

*  employees and people around me putting up. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6509.86s)]
*  That's a heavy schedule to do three out of the park cars, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6512.42s)]
*  three years in a row. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6516.9s)]
*  That's nobody's sleeping. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6517.78s)]

*  Congratulations. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6524.42s)]
*  So I'm very, again, very thankful to those guys. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6525.86s)]
*  And back then there was a guy who had worked for me [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6528.74s)]
*  for about 18 years named Pete. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6531.22s)]
*  And he just moved back to Washington to be near his folks. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6533.06s)]
*  And so he's got a place called Muscle Car Beach. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6536.1s)]
*  I follow him on Instagram. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6538.58s)]

*  people putting up with me because I literally wake up [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6548.26s)]
*  at three in the morning and come up with these ideas [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6550.66s)]
*  and start sketching the ideas. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6552.5s)]
*  And oh my gosh, we got to do this. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6553.860000000001s)]

*  I couldn't do this fucking thing without Jamie. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6573.46s)]
*  I'd be lost. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6575.14s)]
*  First of all, you know, slow eye Google. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6575.9400000000005s)]
*  He Googles faster than me with one hand. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6577.54s)]

*  He's flipping switches. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6581.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I love it down here. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6582.740000000001s)]
*  Came down. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6583.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6584.42s)]
*  Three years ago. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6585.14s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6586.26s)]
*  It's a different way of life. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6587.38s)]
*  Like, yeah, it gets really hot in the summer, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6589.7s)]
*  but that doesn't seem to bother me. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6591.54s)]
*  What I really enjoy is how nice people are. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6593.780000000001s)]
*  It's a different kind of nice. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6596.58s)]
*  They're like real regular nice people. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6598.5s)]
*  They're not Hollywood nice. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6600.58s)]
*  I think I really believe that everywhere in Southern California, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6602.74s)]
*  like just the overall vibration of the area [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6606.820000000001s)]
*  is in some way affected by the vast amount of people [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6612.18s)]
*  that are seeking stardom and want to be something special [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6617.14s)]
*  and want to be seen. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6621.9400000000005s)]
*  And, you know, I'm obviously guilty of that [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6623.3s)]
*  because I'm, you know, comedian and all the other stuff I've done. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6624.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6627.46s)]
*  I was part of it. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6627.9400000000005s)]
*  I understand it. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6628.900000000001s)]
*  I'm not criticizing the people that are doing it, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6629.78s)]
*  but I'm saying that it does affect [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6631.46s)]
*  the way people communicate with each other, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6633.46s)]
*  especially because of acting, [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6635.54s)]
*  because acting is like the number one thing [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6637.38s)]
*  that people came to L.A. for back in the day. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6639.22s)]
*  It was the number one thing. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6641.860000000001s)]
*  If you were a kid and you had a dream, [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6643.22s)]
*  you wanted to be a movie star, you came to L.A. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6644.900000000001s)]
*  And along the way, these people realized, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6647.860000000001s)]
*  like the only way to get chosen for roles, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6650.5s)]
*  you have to have this Daniel Day Lewis, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6654.02s)]
*  like super mysterious, ultra talented person [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6656.34s)]
*  who everybody worships, or you had to play the game. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6659.54s)]
*  So you had to say all the things [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6663.06s)]
*  that the producers wanted you to say, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6665.22s)]
*  you had to support all the political causes, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6667.14s)]
*  you had to check all the boxes, [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6669.22s)]
*  you couldn't think outside the box at all. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6670.580000000001s)]
*  And there's a way of communicating that people have in L.A. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6672.660000000001s)]
*  that it's like signaling that they're a part of this tribe, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6676.1s)]
*  signaling that they're a part of this very progressive, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6678.820000000001s)]
*  ultra left-wing ideology, [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6682.02s)]
*  and everybody has to subscribe to it [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6684.5s)]
*  regardless of the consequences that it has on the city, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6686.18s)]
*  the crime, or the chaos, or all the other stuff. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6688.660000000001s)]
*  And it's just, I think it's tempered by this desire [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6692.26s)]
*  that people have that lived to fit in, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6696.9s)]
*  because they want to be cast in things. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6699.54s)]
*  Like you think about someone who's an actor, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6701.46s)]
*  you're probably already fucked up, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6703.54s)]
*  you're probably already insecure, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6704.98s)]
*  which is why you want this exorbitant amount of attention. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6706.179999999999s)]
*  You probably had a bad childhood or whatever it was, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6708.179999999999s)]
*  whatever it was, you were not stable, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6710.339999999999s)]
*  and you go so far that you desire [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6713.139999999999s)]
*  this exorbitant amount of attention. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6716.0199999999995s)]
*  Then what you have to do is you have to get [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6717.7s)]
*  in front of casting agents so people get to pick you. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6719.54s)]
*  They have to choose whether or not you're good, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6722.66s)]
*  choose whether or not you're worthy, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6724.9s)]
*  and your self-esteem is based on whether or not you get picked. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6726.18s)]
*  And so there's these people that are constantly [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6729.860000000001s)]
*  in this cycle of rejection, [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6732.02s)]
*  constantly in the cycle seeking acceptance and rejection, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6733.860000000001s)]
*  and then they see people that make it, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6736.58s)]
*  and they're furious, why isn't it me? [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6737.860000000001s)]
*  I had a friend, and he was dating this gal, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6740.42s)]
*  and she was an actress too, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6742.820000000001s)]
*  and he got a role on a TV show. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6743.780000000001s)]
*  He was so excited, and he told her about it, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6745.3s)]
*  and she started crying, saying, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6747.06s)]
*  when is something gonna happen for me? [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6748.42s)]
*  It was the first thing she said. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6750.820000000001s)]
*  I was like, dude, that's not good. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6752.66s)]
*  But that is super, super common, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6756.9800000000005s)]
*  and that's a lot of what flavors the consciousness of Los Angeles. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6760.1s)]
*  It has an effect on it, and out here, that doesn't exist. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6766.26s)]
*  It's different. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6771.38s)]
*  I agree. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6772.5s)]
*  And for me, I was really happy to find, agreeing with you, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6773.62s)]
*  to find See Me Valley, because I'm from... [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6780.58s)]
*  Oh yeah, very different. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6782.58s)]
*  Let's go back to the beginning of the conversation. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6784.26s)]
*  I'm from Appalachia, and that's a handshake is your word. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6786.42s)]
*  It's a real simple background. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6791.54s)]
*  Mike sells moonshine. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6794.42s)]
*  So See Me, again, not for a game of name dropping, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6796.9800000000005s)]
*  but I know, like my friend Ezio that has Bomb Hoagie, [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6802.02s)]
*  my favorite little place to get Philly cheesesteaks, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6806.9800000000005s)]
*  which you can't find for shit out in California, [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6809.46s)]
*  does yummy stuff. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6812.66s)]
*  I know, like, Donnish, the manager at my bank. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6814.0199999999995s)]
*  I know Neil, who has, well, of course, East Coast Pizza. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6817.94s)]
*  I know their names. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6823.7s)]
*  I know these people, because it's got that small town feel to it. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6824.58s)]
*  It's not just in and out, and you have no time to meet anybody, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6829.78s)]
*  or know anybody, or you know what I mean? [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6832.74s)]
*  I've been out there, because Tarrantactical, [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6835.14s)]
*  that's out in See Me Valley. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6837.3s)]
*  And it's just a normal neighborhood. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6838.5s)]
*  It's a normal community that's sort of divorced [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6841.22s)]
*  from a lot of what ails LA. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6843.780000000001s)]
*  And I know you had gone there from past times [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6845.7s)]
*  of just telling me, do you still go back? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6848.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, when I'm in LA. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6851.22s)]
*  Yeah, if I'm in LA and I have time, I go back there. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6852.9800000000005s)]
*  Shave in another five minutes since I'm around the corner. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6855.62s)]
*  Well, oftentimes I'm there on Sunday. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6858.26s)]
*  Oh, well, let me know. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6859.7s)]

*  That's cool. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6862.18s)]
*  I didn't know if you went back. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6862.900000000001s)]
*  I know you liked it. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6864.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to know. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6865.14s)]
*  I mean, if you have a gun, it's good to know how to really use it. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6866.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6869.54s)]

*  That guy's awesome. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6872.259999999999s)]
*  He's such a great instructor. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6873.219999999999s)]
*  Does he give you instructions? [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6873.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's instructions. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6875.46s)]
*  Oh, it's not just, here's a range and go shoot it? [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6876.58s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6879.139999999999s)]
*  You're getting taught by a master. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6879.7s)]
*  I mean, Tarrant is like a multiple time world champion [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6882.419999999999s)]
*  in those shooting competitions. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6885.7s)]
*  Yeah, I did not know it was an instructional thing. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6886.82s)]
*  Yeah, he trained Keanu Reeves there for John Wick. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6889.46s)]
*  Yeah, he trained Michael Jordan, Michael B. Jordan. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6893.219999999999s)]
*  He trained him from a bunch of his movies. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6896.9s)]
*  He's trained just a host of people. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6898.58s)]
*  I was there with Rob Lowe. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6900.98s)]
*  I've been there with multiple comedians. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6902.66s)]
*  I took my friend Shane Gillis there. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6904.74s)]
*  It's like he trains people literally from the very beginning, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6906.42s)]
*  how to correctly hold the pistol, how to brace it correctly, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6911.14s)]
*  what amount of pressure you put with your left hand versus your right hand, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6914.1s)]
*  how to line the sights up. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6917.46s)]
*  He teaches you how to do everything correctly. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6919.14s)]
*  That's awesome that Keanu Reeves has that. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6922.42s)]
*  So when he's filming it, he's looking like... [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6924.66s)]
*  Oh, he looks super legit. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6927.54s)]
*  He actually is shooting a gun. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6928.82s)]
*  Super legit. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6931.14s)]
*  If you watch John Wick, he looks super legit. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6931.78s)]
*  He absolutely knows what he's doing because Tarrant trained him. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6934.5s)]
*  I mean, everything he does is exactly how you would do it. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6937.14s)]
*  How long have you known Tarrant? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6939.78s)]
*  Tarrant? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6941.46s)]
*  Tarrant, T-A-R-A-N, years. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6942.1s)]
*  I don't know, many years. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6943.86s)]
*  I think I first went there... [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6945.7s)]
*  I forget who brought me there, honestly. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6948.58s)]
*  I forget who brought me there, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6951.46s)]
*  but you go there for like an hour and he coaches you. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6952.5s)]
*  It's great. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6954.9s)]
*  A couple hours maybe. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6955.46s)]
*  And you always have new people there. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6957.06s)]
*  I've met Chad Stolesky, the guy who produced and directed. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6958.26s)]
*  He actually wrote... [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6962.900000000001s)]
*  Did he write John Wick or did he... [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6963.9400000000005s)]
*  He directed it and produced it. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6966.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think he at least... [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6968.1s)]
*  If he didn't write it by himself, he definitely co-wrote it. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6969.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6971.3s)]
*  So I met him there. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6972.26s)]
*  I met a bunch of really cool people there. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6973.860000000001s)]
*  Because he's always having... [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6977.06s)]
*  The King of Jordan was just there training with him. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6978.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's wild. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6981.06s)]
*  Like he trains people. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6982.02s)]
*  He's that good. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6983.860000000001s)]
*  Like he trains people from all over the world. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6984.58s)]
*  Does he do just firearms or does he do bow and arrow? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6986.0199999999995s)]
*  Just firearms. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6987.86s)]
*  Yeah, they do throw hatchets too. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6989.22s)]
*  So he shows you how to throw a hatchet. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6990.74s)]
*  Because there's a lot of stuff that people use in movies. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6993.78s)]
*  And in John Wick movies and things like that. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6995.62s)]
*  Skill sets. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6997.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6998.18s)]
*  But yeah, Halle Berry trained there. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=6999.3s)]
*  There's all these videos of her learning how to shoot a pistol. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7000.9s)]
*  I don't know if I've ever spoke with you about it. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7005.62s)]
*  I always went growing up, I fiddled with archery, bow and arrows. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7007.7s)]
*  Fascinate me and then you know Nuge. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7011.860000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7015.38s)]
*  He's Whackmaster as his brand is. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7016.5s)]
*  Do you... [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7021.22s)]
*  Yeah, you got into that too, right? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7022.26s)]
*  Bow hunting? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7023.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7024.5s)]
*  Weren't you doing that too? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7024.74s)]
*  Yeah, I still do it. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7025.62s)]
*  I just got back. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7026.58s)]
*  I just got back from an elk hunt in Utah. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7027.22s)]
*  Oh, bow hunting. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7029.3s)]
*  Bow hunting, yeah. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7031.14s)]
*  Yeah, practice every day. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7032.58s)]
*  I was out in my yard today practicing. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7033.62s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7035.14s)]
*  Yeah, always. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7036.26s)]
*  You have to. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7036.9800000000005s)]
*  For me, yeah, for me that's harder. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7037.7s)]
*  Than guns. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7041.78s)]
*  Of course. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7042.66s)]
*  I mean, guns take a skill set for sure. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7043.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, guns aren't easy. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7045.860000000001s)]
*  It's not easy to kill a deer with a rifle. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7047.7s)]
*  I mean, you could get lucky and one can be close. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7049.46s)]
*  But if you're in the mountains, it's very difficult to get close to them. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7051.7s)]
*  You have to understand the wind and how to sneak up on them. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7054.34s)]
*  It's easier with a rifle because you could take a 200-yard shot ethically. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7057.7s)]
*  Whereas with a bow, you really want to get inside of 60 yards if you can. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7061.78s)]
*  Right, and then have the aim. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7065.38s)]
*  You have to be really good. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7066.74s)]
*  Yeah, and then the aim. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7067.7s)]
*  And you have to be able to keep your nerves together. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7068.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I was always. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7070.66s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7072.099999999999s)]
*  Fascinated with it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7073.139999999999s)]
*  And I, my dad, because my area, again, Abel again, a lot of hunting, fishing, that kind of stuff. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7074.099999999999s)]
*  So that was promoted. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7081.0599999999995s)]
*  It's an amazing way to get food. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7083.54s)]
*  It really is. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7085.78s)]
*  Like your food has a. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7086.5s)]
*  It would be a very, it's a very realistic way to get your food. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7087.46s)]
*  You just have a very different connection with what your food is. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7090.58s)]
*  You know, when I eat an elk steak, it's a very different connection than if I eat like a steak [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7093.46s)]
*  that I got from H-E-B. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7097.3s)]
*  Explain. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7098.58s)]
*  Well, you were there when this like the last one I killed was my favorite because it was so old. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7099.96s)]
*  It was an 11 year old elk and his teeth were all worn out. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7106.84s)]
*  Like when we opened his jaw, that's about as old as you get in the mountains. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7110.28s)]
*  Like you might live to be 13, but probably not. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7113.24s)]
*  And during the rut, when they're breeding, they don't eat a lot of the time. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7116.12s)]
*  So they lose a ton of weight because they're just running around chasing tail. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7120.6s)]
*  And literally. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7123.8s)]
*  No pun intended. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7124.68s)]
*  Yeah, no pun intended. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7125.48s)]
*  And then during the winter, it's rough. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7126.44s)]
*  Because they have to eat as much as they can after the rut. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7129.8s)]
*  And by that time, it might already be snowing. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7132.04s)]
*  So the grass might be getting covered up, but it's harder to get food. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7134.5199999999995s)]
*  And, you know, if you're not lucky, you could freeze to death in the winter because you don't [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7137.32s)]
*  have enough fat. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7141.48s)]
*  And it happens to them all the time. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7142.12s)]
*  And that's generally how they go out or a cat gets them. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7143.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7146.36s)]
*  And one of the two is probably coming, you know, or they can get injured and a cat catches them [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7146.92s)]
*  limping and then that's a wrap. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7152.28s)]
*  You know, they're it's a fucking hard scrabble life. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7154.44s)]
*  So that was my favorite because you got them. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7157.72s)]
*  We got them at the right time. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7159.88s)]
*  Eleven years old. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7161.16s)]
*  This is like that's a really good time. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7161.88s)]
*  That's a real mature, wise old elk. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7164.2s)]
*  They just caught slipping. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7167.08s)]
*  You know, and so when I'm eating that, I'm eating something that I work really hard to get to. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7169.240000000001s)]
*  I practice really hard. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7173.64s)]
*  I got in really good shape. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7174.68s)]
*  Did all these things with the work on my aim, work on my my precision with my shooting and just [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7176.2s)]
*  work on all the things, the cardio, all the things that you have to do to do it. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7182.2s)]
*  So it's just a very different connection than just I'll still eat a steak at a restaurant. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7186.44s)]
*  I still love them. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7190.839999999999s)]
*  So great. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7192.12s)]
*  It's just a different experience. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7193.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7194.679999999999s)]
*  Well, sure. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7195.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7196.12s)]
*  It's more definitely more personal. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7196.599999999999s)]
*  It's definitely more personal, but it's also more honest. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7198.92s)]
*  You know, it's a much more honest exchange, you know, especially if you're getting some [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7202.2s)]
*  factory farm shit like a lot of weird karma that comes with that. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7208.04s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of weird karma. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7213.24s)]
*  It's so easy to get a chicken sandwich, you know, it's so easy to pull into a drive through [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7214.52s)]
*  and get a chicken sandwich. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7217.8s)]
*  But if you had to see the life that chicken lived, you'd probably be pretty fucking horrified. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7218.76s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of the chickens we buy. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7225.320000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen those chicken trucks that are driving down the street on the highway [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7227.4800000000005s)]
*  and they're just stuffed with chickens. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7231.240000000001s)]
*  And you're like, yo, that's that's a fucked up life. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7232.68s)]
*  Or do you ever see the one where the pigs there was a car accident, I think, and the pigs jumped [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7237.240000000001s)]
*  out of the fucking truck and they were like splattered all over the highway. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7242.44s)]
*  They they they, you know, tried to escape. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7245.4s)]
*  Yeah, not good. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7250.12s)]
*  So so like I said, it's a very different thing. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7252.04s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7255.32s)]
*  No, agreed. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7255.879999999999s)]
*  Understood. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7256.679999999999s)]
*  So you're still hunting. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7257.4s)]
*  Obviously, you just came back from once. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7258.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's also it's a good reset for me because, you know, I do this weird thing where everybody [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7260.12s)]
*  listens to me talk. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7265.96s)]
*  Very strange. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7267.48s)]
*  You know, the whole thing is very strange. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7268.28s)]
*  And you could get a very inflated sense of your worth and your perspective and your place on Earth. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7270.200000000001s)]
*  But when you're in the mountains, that's literally impossible. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7276.92s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7279.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7280.68s)]
*  You know how tired you get when you go up the hill. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7281.72s)]
*  Yep. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7283.400000000001s)]
*  You know what a bitch you are. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7283.8s)]
*  You know, in comparison to these other animals that are out there hunting these things, you are not. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7286.04s)]
*  You're only an apex predator because you have a bow. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7290.120000000001s)]
*  That's about it. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7292.84s)]
*  That's it. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7293.72s)]
*  In fact, that is it. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7294.04s)]
*  That's the only reason. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7295.400000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, it's you're also encountering this unforgiving, uncaring, beautiful. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7296.52s)]
*  Landscape. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7305.400000000001s)]
*  It's not just a landscape. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7306.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a realm. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7308.040000000001s)]
*  Fair enough. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7309.72s)]
*  When you're there, it's like when you're in the actual wild, it's a realm. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7310.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a different realm than the realm we exist in. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7315.400000000001s)]
*  I know you can just walk into it. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7317.88s)]
*  But once you are in there, you are living inside this ancient system. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7320.280000000001s)]
*  This ancient system of tooth and claw, this ancient system of breeding and survival and predators [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7326.6s)]
*  and carnivores and these animals that are just there to pick up the mess, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7334.120000000001s)]
*  the vultures that swoop in and the birds. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7340.52s)]
*  And it's just a fucking wild place to be, man. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7342.68s)]
*  And it just completely resets me. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7345.88s)]
*  Just down the line. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7349.88s)]
*  I understand and agree. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7350.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7352.040000000001s)]
*  You have good reverence. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7352.76s)]
*  A long time ago, I met a couple of Indians, Native American, that tried to follow basically [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7356.04s)]
*  their lineage. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7364.04s)]
*  And the discussion was that the same vein of the respect of that. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7365.0s)]
*  You described it well, that realm. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7373.16s)]
*  It is like a realm. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7375.16s)]
*  That's why it's so disappointing when you find garbage. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7378.280000000001s)]
*  The saddest thing when you're on some public trail and you see a water bottle that someone [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7381.0s)]
*  just discarded, like, oh, no, you're bringing our bullshit into this incredible realm. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7385.96s)]
*  In that realm, there's no garbage. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7392.44s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7393.96s)]
*  Everything gets eaten. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7395.08s)]
*  Everything that dies gets consumed by the earth. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7396.679999999999s)]
*  It becomes fertilizer for the trees. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7399.24s)]
*  It becomes food for all these creatures that live there. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7401.48s)]
*  It's all a cycle. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7406.36s)]
*  It's an insanely perfect cycle. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7407.5599999999995s)]
*  And when you're there, it's just like, okay. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7409.96s)]
*  It just puts it all in perspective. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7412.84s)]
*  It's also fucking thrilling, man. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7414.759999999999s)]
*  Like, when you're around these animals, you see an eagle fly overhead. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7418.04s)]
*  It's like, wow. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7421.799999999999s)]
*  It's thrilling. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7423.5599999999995s)]
*  Big bird. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7424.759999999999s)]
*  In California a few years back, I watched a golden eagle grab a rabbit. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7425.4s)]
*  Real big bird. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7429.96s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7431.24s)]
*  It was awesome. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7432.04s)]
*  He swooped in and we saw it just, we were driving in a truck and we saw it just at the very end. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7433.719999999999s)]
*  There was this rabbit that was right underneath the branches of this tree. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7439.32s)]
*  And this eagle just swooped in and grabbed it. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7443.96s)]
*  And just grabbed it on the ground and started flapping its wings and going up this little hill with it. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7446.92s)]
*  And we were like, holy shit. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7451.16s)]
*  Again, from the background where I'm from, a lot of farms. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7456.2s)]
*  A lot of mobsters, too. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7458.84s)]
*  Well, there was that. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7460.759999999999s)]
*  But a lot of farms worked when I was younger, chucking hay bales. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7462.28s)]
*  And because of being around barns, I see owls. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7467.160000000001s)]
*  How amazing. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7472.84s)]
*  They are. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7474.4400000000005s)]
*  They are. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7474.92s)]
*  Everyone's like, owls are so fascinating and cool and neat. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7476.280000000001s)]
*  I'm like, they are a cold-blooded assassin. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7479.4800000000005s)]
*  Ruthless night stalkers. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7483.080000000001s)]
*  Ruthless and absolutely silent. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7484.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're amazing. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7487.96s)]
*  They make no noise. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7488.52s)]
*  They are nature's hitman. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7490.280000000001s)]
*  Have you ever seen the video? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7492.84s)]
*  It's a trail camera video that they set up on this nest of hawks. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7494.12s)]
*  So these hawks in this nest. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7498.12s)]
*  And they're sitting there at night just looking around. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7499.8s)]
*  This owl comes in from the background. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7501.64s)]
*  You see his eyes in the distance and just snatches them. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7504.04s)]
*  Watch this, because it's amazing. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7507.32s)]
*  This is what an owl is. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7509.96s)]
*  It's not give a hoot, don't pollute. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7510.92s)]
*  This is the way you get to the library. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7513.16s)]
*  They are assassins. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7516.599999999999s)]
*  So look in the distance and you'll see the eyes soon. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7518.36s)]
*  There they are. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7520.68s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7521.32s)]
*  Here they come. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7521.88s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7525.08s)]
*  They'll just appear. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7526.28s)]
*  Well, I'm sure he'll make real quick work of it. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7527.64s)]
*  Here it comes. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7531.5599999999995s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7532.2s)]
*  Look at the eyes. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7532.68s)]
*  Oh, bam. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7533.72s)]
*  And that other one is like, what? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7535.72s)]
*  Where's my brother? [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7538.44s)]
*  What just happened? [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7539.24s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7540.04s)]
*  Like I said, just absolutely silent and unbelievably efficient. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7541.08s)]
*  Look at the eyes, man. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7545.96s)]
*  That's a demon. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7548.84s)]
*  Wham. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7549.8s)]
*  I mean, that is a demon. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7550.36s)]
*  It's just a fluffy demon. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7551.16s)]
*  Fluffy demon. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7552.5199999999995s)]
*  If that thing was doing that to people and it was covered in like lizard scales, [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7553.24s)]
*  we would say, oh my God, it's a demon. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7557.32s)]
*  But because it's got feathers, for some reason, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7559.639999999999s)]
*  we like to think this thing is this wise, cute thing. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7562.599999999999s)]
*  Bam. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7566.12s)]
*  Now, I've watched them hunt. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7567.4s)]
*  And I think the thing that was most fascinating to me is they're absolutely silent. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7569.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7575.32s)]
*  There's no noise. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7576.04s)]
*  The prey has no idea that thing's coming. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7578.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7582.2s)]
*  When we were just leaving California, we found one that looked like it had been poisoned. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7583.0s)]
*  It's a real bummer, man. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7587.8s)]
*  An owl? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7588.84s)]
*  Yeah, because what happens is people poison rats. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7589.96s)]
*  If people have rats in their garbage, they'll put rat poison out. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7594.04s)]
*  Of course. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7598.52s)]
*  The rats eat the poison, the owls eat the rats, and the owls die. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7598.76s)]
*  And so I'm not an expert in owls, but there was something really wrong, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7603.96s)]
*  because it was sitting in the front door of our house. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7608.92s)]
*  And it was literally the day before we moved to Texas. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7611.72s)]
*  Just sitting there, dying. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7615.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, at the old house back home. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7616.04s)]
*  Yeah, so it was symbolic. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7618.2s)]
*  To me, it was almost symbolic of the life I knew here, dying. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7620.92s)]
*  That I had to leave it. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7625.96s)]
*  Was it a little guy, big guy? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7627.4800000000005s)]
*  Like about that big, regular-sized owl. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7629.96s)]
*  It was a mature owl. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7632.76s)]
*  It was a mature owl, but it was fucked up, man. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7633.96s)]
*  It was just fucked up, just trying to move a little, [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7636.12s)]
*  and couldn't move its wings. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7640.44s)]
*  It was very, very, very sad. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7641.4s)]
*  And I know where I lived was very hilly. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7643.48s)]
*  There's a lot of rats. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7646.28s)]
*  There's a lot of coyotes. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7647.24s)]
*  There's a lot of wildlife out there. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7648.599999999999s)]
*  So I'm assuming that someone poisoned it. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7649.879999999999s)]
*  Because it was a suburban community, and people don't want rats in their garbage. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7652.2s)]
*  They don't understand the food chain. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7656.12s)]
*  But I think that was a real problem that was killing off a lot of owls. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7657.879999999999s)]
*  See if that's documented. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7661.799999999999s)]
*  Because I think that was a real problem in the Hollywood Hills as well. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7664.36s)]
*  That people were poisoning rats, and the rat poison was killing owls. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7668.6s)]
*  It's a bummer, man. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7674.200000000001s)]
*  But there's something about those. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7675.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know how they got labeled the way they got labeled. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7679.64s)]
*  Like I don't know how they got a monocle and a book. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7683.0s)]
*  Like something happened. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7686.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that would be the wise, right? [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7687.64s)]
*  The wise old owl. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7689.88s)]
*  Rat poison from marijuana farms is harming federally threatened northern spotted owls. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7691.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a thing. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7697.879999999999s)]
*  It's not, I'm sure it's not just the marijuana farms. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7698.679999999999s)]
*  I know people in my neighborhood are using rat poison. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7701.5599999999995s)]
*  I know that. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7704.679999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7705.32s)]
*  Because people would ask you, how do you deal with the rats? [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7705.96s)]
*  Well, it doesn't sound like that's a far-fetched theory. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7708.44s)]
*  That's for sure. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7710.759999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7711.32s)]
*  Do you know how smart rats are? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7711.799999999999s)]
*  That if you leave some poison. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7714.12s)]
*  Yes, I had rats as pets. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7715.16s)]
*  Did you? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7716.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7717.16s)]
*  Have you ever seen the Netflix show Rats? [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7717.719999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7719.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7720.5199999999995s)]
*  There's an amazing documentary on Netflix called Rats. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7721.48s)]
*  And you watch it and you just go, what? [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7725.64s)]
*  Like you don't understand the scope of the rat problem in this country. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7727.96s)]
*  Like you don't know that there's more the same. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7731.8s)]
*  I think they think it's the exact same biomass. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7734.44s)]
*  I think in New York City, the biomass of rats surpasses the biomass of humans. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7737.96s)]
*  So if you weighed all the plausible in New York City, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7743.5599999999995s)]
*  I think the rat biomass is actually either the same or larger. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7746.5199999999995s)]
*  That's how many rats there are in New York City. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7751.88s)]
*  Yay. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7753.48s)]
*  See if that's true. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7754.12s)]
*  First, I know that I've read multiple. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7756.04s)]
*  They don't have an accurate estimation of the rat. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7758.84s)]
*  It's like fish in the ocean. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7760.84s)]
*  It's a huge different number. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7761.72s)]
*  It's like 2 million or 50 million. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7762.6s)]
*  If it's 2 million, it's 25% of the human population there. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7764.68s)]
*  And if it's 50 million, it's what? [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7767.72s)]
*  And it's way more. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7768.84s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7769.4s)]
*  It depends on how many there really are. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7769.88s)]
*  I bet it's 100 million. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7771.08s)]
*  Fucking rats in New York City, it's insane how many there are. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7772.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm very familiar. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7775.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7776.44s)]
*  And this documentary shows how intelligent they are. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7777.16s)]
*  One of the things they do, if you leave poison in a rat tunnel [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7780.36s)]
*  where the rats go, the rats will get a young, stupid rat [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7785.24s)]
*  to go eat the poison. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7788.84s)]
*  It's like, hey, man, look at that food. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7789.72s)]
*  And they'll sit back and watch. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7791.5599999999995s)]
*  The old rats will sit back and watch. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7792.76s)]
*  And the young rat goes over, starts eating poison. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7794.44s)]
*  And they go, yep, thought so. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7797.08s)]
*  And they take off. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7798.36s)]
*  They know. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7799.5599999999995s)]
*  There's videos of rats setting rat traps with sticks. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7800.5199999999995s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7805.8s)]
*  No. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7806.679999999999s)]
*  Pull that video. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7807.96s)]
*  Totally believable. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7808.599999999999s)]
*  They set up a rat trap. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7809.48s)]
*  And this rat walks over and picks up a stick [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7810.839999999999s)]
*  and drops it on the rat trap so it can get the cheese. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7814.44s)]
*  That's how fucking smart they are. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7819.4s)]
*  Those little creeps. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7821.32s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7823.5599999999995s)]
*  So look at this rat. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7824.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a rat, right? [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7826.44s)]
*  It's on a mouse. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7827.5599999999995s)]
*  It says mouse trap. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7828.759999999999s)]
*  But isn't that a rat? [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7829.5599999999995s)]
*  Like the tail? [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7832.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7833.5599999999995s)]
*  What is that? [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7833.879999999999s)]
*  That looks small enough to be a mouse. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7834.44s)]
*  But it could be a rat. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7836.12s)]
*  Either way, whatever this fucking thing is. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7837.719999999999s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7839.24s)]
*  Wow. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7839.88s)]
*  Snap. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7840.76s)]
*  With a fucking stick, man. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7841.719999999999s)]
*  Like it knows how to set that thing off. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7843.5599999999995s)]
*  And it didn't even flinch. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7845.4s)]
*  You imagine you don't know that that's going to happen. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7847.4s)]
*  And you drop a stick on something and it explodes. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7849.48s)]
*  Watch that mouse or rat or whatever the fuck it is. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7852.28s)]
*  That thing. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7854.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, you're right. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7855.0s)]
*  He didn't freak out because the thing went snap. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7855.4s)]
*  Yeah, world's smartest rat. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7859.08s)]
*  So it is a rat. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7860.28s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7860.92s)]
*  This motherfucker doesn't even flinch. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7862.12s)]
*  Watch. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7864.12s)]
*  Drops it on there. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7865.16s)]
*  Not a budge. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7867.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7868.12s)]
*  Not at all. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7868.599999999999s)]
*  Just like cracking a safe. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7869.4s)]
*  If it's a rat, do you think maybe this kid trained it? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7871.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7874.04s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7874.28s)]
*  That's why it's not afraid. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7874.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7875.639999999999s)]
*  It didn't just happen randomly. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7875.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably for the clicks. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7877.5599999999995s)]
*  Because he used to teach him to play basketball where I was from. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7879.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7881.16s)]
*  It might be for the clicks. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7882.28s)]
*  Or it might be a legit video of how fucking smart rats were. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7883.48s)]
*  Like he was trying to figure out how are these motherfuckers not dying? [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7887.4s)]
*  Maybe he just kept a rat trap in the same spot over and over and over again. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7890.36s)]
*  And eventually they realized, oh, every time it snaps, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7893.48s)]
*  then a rat gets killed, but the food's still there. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7896.36s)]
*  This account is, he's got Mousetrap Monday, so he must have. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7898.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, so he's like running experiments. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7903.08s)]
*  That's a mouse in the picture. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7904.5199999999995s)]
*  If that's his buddy pal. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7907.5599999999995s)]
*  Was the other one a mouse or a rat though? [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7908.839999999999s)]
*  Stunt mouse. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7911.32s)]
*  So this is the guy that did that little video? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7912.04s)]
*  Yeah, so I was noticing in this account had like 2 million followers. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7914.04s)]
*  I was like, this might be. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7916.759999999999s)]
*  It says mouse. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7918.28s)]
*  It says Mousetrap Monday. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7919.16s)]
*  So they look like mice in that little thing that he's holding, right? [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7920.599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7923.88s)]
*  So he must have trained mice. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7925.0s)]
*  And he probably incentivizes them to snap the trap. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7928.04s)]
*  Yeah, the theory of what, Pavlo Stag or whatever. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7931.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7935.72s)]
*  Repeat, repeat, learn. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7936.36s)]
*  I wonder how he taught them how to set a trap with a fucking stick. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7937.96s)]
*  I wonder how many died trying to figure it out. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7941.24s)]
*  I know, right? [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7944.5199999999995s)]
*  He probably sacrificed a lot of his little pets. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7945.08s)]
*  The dark side to Mousetrap Monday. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7948.28s)]
*  Yeah, the very dark side to Mousetrap Monday. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7950.44s)]
*  What are you doing over there, man? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7953.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7955.88s)]
*  I know, right? [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7957.16s)]
*  If like, if you're running tests. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7957.8s)]
*  Someone's going to use mice. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7960.599999999999s)]
*  So I bet he would have the video of him teaching it if he did do that, too. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7962.599999999999s)]
*  Because I would get that would get some views, you know? [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7965.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7968.68s)]
*  It's a strange thing. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7970.2s)]
*  I mean, it's obviously that we have this distaste for rats and mice because they [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7972.36s)]
*  carry these bugs that carry the plague and they carry diseases and they document that [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7976.76s)]
*  in the Netflix special to the Netflix special shows like some of them have plague. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7981.96s)]
*  There's like some. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7986.12s)]
*  Hooray. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7986.84s)]
*  Yeah, they catch me. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7987.4s)]
*  Obviously, not a lot of people are getting bitten by rats, but if you were, you'd be fucked. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7988.44s)]
*  There's a lot of them that are just horrific. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7992.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I have to congratulate you. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7995.72s)]
*  For what? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7999.0s)]
*  On something you may not know. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=7999.48s)]
*  So. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8002.68s)]
*  Are you on the fucking? [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8003.48s)]
*  I don't. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8004.599999999999s)]
*  I talk with my hands. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8004.92s)]
*  What do you want? [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8005.88s)]
*  You may not know. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8008.2s)]
*  What is it? [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8009.72s)]
*  So I got together with a guy named Drew Hardin, who's been an editor like. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8010.599999999999s)]
*  They got hot rod and run custom bunch of different books, and he's written books like books. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8015.4800000000005s)]
*  He had a book called Hot Rod magazine, all the covers, which covered up to no pun all the way [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8020.6s)]
*  up to 2009. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8026.36s)]
*  Hot Rod started in 1947. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8027.96s)]
*  So all the way up to 2009, every cover ever printed. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8030.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8033.0s)]
*  And then he just released a new book like the history of Hot Rod magazine, right? [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8033.72s)]
*  Which began every automotive magazine. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8040.28s)]
*  That was the first. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8042.68s)]
*  And Mr. Peterson, I mean, he had everything. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8043.32s)]
*  He had Hot Rod. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8046.92s)]
*  He had Field and Stream, Better Homes and Gardens, like every made popular science. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8047.88s)]
*  Every book you could think of was him, if I remember right. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8052.12s)]
*  Anyway, so I, because of your latest cover, asked Drew, hey, man, how many how many cars [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8054.759999999999s)]
*  have ever been have been on the Hot Rod magazine twice? [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8067.16s)]
*  Twice. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8070.5199999999995s)]
*  And I have every issue of Hot Rod from 47 to now, but it's easier to ask someone who's [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8071.72s)]
*  like written a book about the covers and go through every one of them. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8078.12s)]
*  And we found 14 cars that had been on the cover twice. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8081.48s)]
*  But I said, hey, how many cars have been on the cover? [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8087.08s)]
*  Three times. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8093.48s)]
*  And there's five. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8095.72s)]
*  And one of them, I mean, it made the criteria. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8097.24s)]
*  It was on the cover three times, but it was Hot Rod magazine's crusher Camaro. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8101.48s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, that's insider trading. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8106.599999999999s)]
*  The editors can put their own car on the cover. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8108.599999999999s)]
*  But nevertheless, but your Nova was on shared cover with my Buick funny car Skylark. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8110.599999999999s)]
*  It's clearly in the cover. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8120.12s)]
*  That was part of the criteria. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8121.24s)]
*  Is the vehicle if there's more than one car on the cover, is the vehicle, [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8122.44s)]
*  is it on purpose and yours was on purpose? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8127.64s)]
*  It's on the side. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8132.2s)]
*  It's not even back there. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8133.32s)]
*  It's here. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8134.68s)]
*  And then it was on the cover in bare metal built and then brand new out right now in the newsstands. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8135.5599999999995s)]
*  So you are one of five cars ever in the history of Hot Rod magazine [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8142.84s)]
*  to be on the cover three times. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8147.8s)]
*  That's pretty fucking cool. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8149.32s)]
*  And congratulations, sir. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8150.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8151.96s)]
*  What does it look like on the cover? [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8152.68s)]
*  Show me the cover of the magazine. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8153.72s)]
*  Oh, I've got in my briefcase. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8155.16s)]

*  I brought one for you right now. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8157.96s)]
*  Yes, you will. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8159.48s)]
*  Brand new issue of Hot Rod magazine. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8160.04s)]
*  I've got it on my phone, but he'll find it. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8164.04s)]
*  I'm sure Jamie will. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8166.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8166.92s)]
*  Well, he's an island. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8167.48s)]
*  You know, he's an island. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8168.36s)]
*  He'll find a rock. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8169.24s)]
*  Wow. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8170.92s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8171.48s)]
*  So but now no pressure out to our our our editor on four times that we're trying to do. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8173.5599999999995s)]
*  No, no, we're all done with that car. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8181.72s)]
*  OK, let's go. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8184.28s)]
*  What's his pressure? [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8185.0s)]
*  No, no, John McGann, who's the current editor of Hot Rod magazine, [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8185.799999999999s)]
*  which we thank for for for the for the wonderful cover. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8189.16s)]
*  You find it? [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8192.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8193.16s)]
*  If I'm putting it out there, putting it out there to the car universe, [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8195.16s)]
*  if he gets the opportunity or wishes to feature the your there you go. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8199.56s)]
*  Hot Rod remixed. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8206.359999999999s)]
*  There it is. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8207.48s)]
*  So your sick fish 2.0 that the roadster shop did a wonderful, beautiful job. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8208.92s)]
*  If they feature it again and if the gods of Hot Rod deem it so to put it on the cover, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8216.6s)]
*  I'm putting it out there if no pressure, John. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8223.880000000001s)]
*  But if if that happened, you would be the only human on the planet to own two vehicles, [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8226.12s)]
*  one that's been on the cover twice because sick fish was on the cover once in bare metal. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8232.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8236.12s)]
*  And then the Nova's on the cover three times. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8236.84s)]
*  You would be the only human in history. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8239.24s)]
*  Someone can have that. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8242.12s)]
*  Someone else can have it. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8243.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8243.960000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8244.36s)]
*  It's OK. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8245.56s)]
*  What do I know? [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8246.2s)]

*  You know what? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8256.44s)]
*  And that's really true. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8257.0s)]
*  I've talked with a lot of people because they ask me because obviously you're well known [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8257.72s)]

*  for what those things are and the magic that they instill [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8480.52s)]
*  in some people. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8485.24s)]

*  So that's why I like those cars. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8496.12s)]
*  Those cars to me are like how someone wants to buy a Van Gogh. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8498.44s)]
*  They want to put this fucking Jackson Pollock painting [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8502.68s)]
*  on their wall. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8505.560000000001s)]

*  is functional art like a car. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8517.720000000001s)]

*  I agree completely. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8523.880000000001s)]
*  And that's what drives me is to create it and build it. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8525.24s)]
*  And then when I'm done with that, I'm like, really? [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8531.32s)]
*  I'd love it. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8533.56s)]
*  And then I can't wait to do the next thing I'm going to create [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8534.36s)]
*  and do and build. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8538.36s)]
*  And that's the excitement for me is the design and then the make it. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8539.24s)]

*  I say they're good humans. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8577.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8579.24s)]
*  They're just a good human being. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8579.56s)]
*  They're good fisher folk. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8581.4s)]
*  They're nice fisher folk. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8583.08s)]
*  That's today's word. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8584.68s)]
*  Fisher folk. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8586.44s)]
*  Frightening word, but yeah. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8589.960000000001s)]
*  It's not really. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8591.480000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I am really- [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8593.160000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8594.52s)]
*  And that's- [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8595.240000000002s)]
*  Really thankful for my- I call it the shop family because I've got my guys, [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8595.880000000001s)]
*  the current crop of Troy and Kelly and then our new boy Tommy. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8602.36s)]
*  And then my sublet guys, as I've already said, Mick and Gabe's, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8607.960000000001s)]
*  those guys I consider an arm off of my shop because they become involved with it. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8612.44s)]
*  Sure. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8618.44s)]
*  They treat my stuff like it's something- [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8618.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8621.240000000002s)]
*  You know, they put the care into it and their talent into it. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8621.800000000001s)]
*  And so it is a group of like- [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8625.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8629.560000000001s)]
*  Like you said, like-minded guys that, you know, and they care that their name's on it. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8629.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8634.52s)]
*  They actually want to do a good job. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8635.08s)]
*  That's why your story's cool, is because your story, [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8635.960000000001s)]
*  you know, building that first car in the garage like that. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8638.84s)]
*  Or the barn, yeah. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8642.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8642.84s)]
*  But all that stuff, that's what people need to hear. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8643.64s)]
*  Like that there's a path to finding what it is you do. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8645.960000000001s)]
*  And that path is going to be weird and it's going to take a long time sometimes. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8650.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8654.36s)]
*  It's difficult and it's not going to be easy and you're going to fucking struggle, [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8654.68s)]
*  but you can do it. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8658.28s)]
*  People can do it. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8659.24s)]
*  People have done it. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8659.880000000001s)]
*  And maybe you didn't do it this time. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8660.6s)]
*  So pick yourself up and try it again. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8662.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8664.44s)]
*  Keep doing it and keep trying to find that thing. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8664.76s)]
*  And if you can find that thing, you'll have a happier life. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8667.48s)]
*  And thank you for recognizing that because I agree with that. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8671.24s)]
*  It's like, you know, you've actually got to work hard at this. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8674.359999999999s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8677.64s)]
*  Whatever it is, it doesn't have to be building a car. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8678.039999999999s)]
*  How long did that Nova take to build? [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8681.08s)]
*  That took a long fucking time. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8682.6s)]
*  Way too long. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8684.359999999999s)]
*  Obviously a lot of that was your eye issues, but it took a long fucking time. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8684.92s)]
*  It takes a long time to make something. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8688.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8690.119999999999s)]
*  Now if I had nothing else to do and we just did that, it wouldn't be done much quicker. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8690.439999999999s)]
*  Even Hammer, how many years did that take? [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8693.48s)]
*  A couple of years. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8695.56s)]
*  Yeah, years, years of everyday work. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8696.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8698.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8699.0s)]
*  You need to understand. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8699.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8700.28s)]
*  This is not something that gets made quick. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8700.6s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8702.36s)]
*  It is a long time. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8702.92s)]
*  I remember going to visit you and like, you know, seeing the process from the very beginning, [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8704.36s)]
*  the bare frame and we sat in it to measure my height and make sure the windshield is a perfect size. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8709.08s)]
*  It's all fitted for you. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8716.12s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8717.400000000001s)]
*  It's really, really fucking cool. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8718.28s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8720.36s)]
*  It's great. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8721.08s)]
*  You know, what you do is it's much appreciated. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8721.640000000001s)]
*  And you've done a really cool thing with this too, because this has evolved and grown and done [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8724.92s)]
*  things. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8729.960000000001s)]
*  It's interesting to me because I watched there was the comedian thing and then there was this thing [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8730.68s)]
*  because this isn't funny. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8742.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8742.52s)]
*  Well, that's the thing that comedians are afraid of. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8743.08s)]
*  Like they're afraid of like you have to be funny always. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8745.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8747.8s)]
*  You've done a fantastic job of separating church and state almost. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8748.84s)]
*  Well, the real separation is the UFC. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8754.84s)]
*  That's my real separation because I'm not even remotely funny on the UFC. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8757.08s)]
*  True. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8761.0s)]
*  The UFC is just 100%. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8761.4s)]
*  I don't swim in those waters because I don't but I know of you being there, obviously. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8763.64s)]
*  But it's like it's a completely different gig. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8767.0s)]
*  It's a martial arts expert gig. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8769.16s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8770.76s)]
*  I'm analyzing choices. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8771.48s)]
*  I'm looking at like positions. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8774.28s)]
*  I'm looking at the trends in the fight. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8776.04s)]
*  You're analyzing. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8778.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8778.839999999998s)]
*  Like you said. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8779.08s)]
*  I'm trying to like give justice to what these guys are doing. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8779.48s)]
*  Like commentary. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8782.279999999999s)]
*  Not to pretend to interview you but did you I think it just naturally happened. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8783.4s)]
*  I don't think you on purpose set out to do these three things. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8789.0s)]
*  No. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8792.119999999999s)]
*  The comedy and then the Joe Rogan experience, this show and then the commentary for the [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8792.439999999999s)]
*  fighting. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8798.759999999998s)]
*  No. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8799.08s)]
*  Those are just things I like. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8799.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8801.72s)]
*  And they just happened that way. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8802.039999999999s)]
*  It just happened the things I like I wound up doing professionally. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8802.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8807.0s)]
*  And the UFC was. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8807.48s)]
*  But if you step away from it, it's very curious. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8808.92s)]
*  There are three very different things. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8811.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8813.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8813.56s)]
*  But they're all three things that I have a genuine interest and passion for. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8813.72s)]
*  And I think I learned something from all three of those things. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8817.32s)]
*  And I think all three of those things for in my life, they all feed off of each other [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8820.199999999999s)]
*  and they all help each other. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8825.24s)]
*  They all work symbiotically. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8827.0s)]
*  Like being a person who talks to people all the time about different paths, different [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8829.4s)]
*  life. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8835.4s)]
*  That informs you on the way different people think and the way different people express [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8837.4s)]
*  themselves, the way different people, what they like and what they don't like. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8841.72s)]
*  And then with MMA, it's like what's possible. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8844.6s)]
*  Like talking about Michael Bisping fighting 10 fights with one fucking eye and winning [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8847.64s)]
*  the world title as a huge underdog in a last minute replacement fight. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8851.8s)]
*  You see like the human spirit in this very raw and just unfiltered form [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8857.32s)]
*  that I don't think very many people get to see. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8864.52s)]
*  It's a wild type of human being that participates in that. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8866.28s)]
*  And the risks they take and the rewards that they get, the highs that they get. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8871.640000000001s)]
*  There's an amazing speech. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8876.04s)]
*  Find Israel Adesanya's speech after he beat Alex Pejeda. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8877.720000000001s)]
*  Israel Adesanya, who's one of my favorite fighters of all time, he loses his title to [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8883.16s)]
*  this guy, Alex Pejeda. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8887.880000000001s)]
*  This guy, Alex Pejeda has beat him twice in kickboxing. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8889.08s)]
*  One time he knocked him out and then they're fighting in the UFC for Israel Adesanya's [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8892.28s)]
*  world title. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8897.960000000001s)]
*  Israel loses the title to him in a TKO. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8898.76s)]
*  Then he comes back five months later and knocks him out and back it up. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKk9szXwgqc&t=8901.24s)]
