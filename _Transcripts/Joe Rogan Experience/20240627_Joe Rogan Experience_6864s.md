*  COVID happened. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=45.28s)]
*  So it's been almost the biggest fight of my life trying to get this thing done. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=46.28s)]
*  But yeah, it's finally, finally going to be done and hopefully into the year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=50.64s)]

*  Yeah, in Temecula. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=57.4s)]
*  That's a good area. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=59.0s)]
*  No, I love it there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=60.0s)]
*  Last time I saw you was at that casino. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=61.0s)]

*  Yeah, no, I love it out there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=67.12s)]
*  I was born and raised in California, so it'd be hard to leave. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=69.8s)]
*  I got so many roots there, but living in Temecula, I feel like I'm in one of the best [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=74.2s)]
*  spots in California. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=79.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the best. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=80.16s)]
*  It's most sane. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=81.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, I agree. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=82.52s)]
*  It's pretty sane. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=83.52s)]
*  Yeah, pretty. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=84.52s)]
*  A lot of ranches and it's like normal people. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=86.16s)]
*  Not a lot of craziness going on. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=88.56s)]
*  Yeah, you get closer to Los Angeles, it just gets polluted. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=90.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=93.88s)]
*  Just toxic fucking thinking. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=94.88s)]
*  Where did you live up there? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=95.88s)]
*  I lived in Bell Canyon, which was like a half hour outside of LA, which was nice. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=97.24s)]
*  Like I had land and a lot of coyotes and a lot of owls and hawks and shit and mountain [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=102.84s)]
*  lions. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=108.72s)]
*  It's good. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=109.72s)]
*  It's good. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=110.72s)]
*  It was good, like juxtaposition. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=111.72s)]
*  It was a nice relief from Hollywood. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  I get there, it's quiet. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=115.2s)]
*  And how was the little community though, the area? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=116.8s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=118.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's fine. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=119.84s)]
*  Like it here better though? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=120.84s)]
*  Oh yeah, way better. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=122.4s)]
*  I'm never leaving. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=125.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=127.36s)]
*  No, this place is the best. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=128.36s)]
*  It's just the freedom that you get in Texas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=130.72s)]
*  It's just so much. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=132.88s)]
*  You just get so accustomed to it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=133.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, I couldn't imagine, but yeah, I don't know if I could deal with the humidity [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=136.04s)]
*  of out here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  You get used to it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=145.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=146.12s)]
*  I've always liked the heat. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=147.12s)]
*  It doesn't bother me at all. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=148.12s)]
*  You know, I just, because I do the sauna every day anyway, so I think my body's like acclimated [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=149.12s)]
*  to heat. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  So during the summertime, you don't really have to get in the sauna? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  I get in the sauna too. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=157.44s)]
*  I do it every day. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=158.88s)]
*  But during the day, like getting ready for elk season, I was out in my yard every day [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=160.16s)]
*  for three hours and 105 degrees. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=165.04s)]
*  I just bring a 64 ounce hydro flask filled with electrolytes and water and just drink [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=166.84s)]
*  that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=171.88s)]
*  I would come inside and it was literally like I went swimming. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=173.72s)]
*  I would just be drenched. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  My jeans, my shirt, everything drenched. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  What are you doing out in the yard? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  Just shooting. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=180.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=181.4s)]
*  Just shooting, you know, getting ready. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=182.4s)]
*  So I had to practice. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=183.4s)]
*  So it's like there's only one place I could practice 100 yards. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=184.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=188.64s)]
*  It's in the yard. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=189.64s)]
*  So I was out there practicing every day. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=190.64s)]
*  Have you taken a hundred yard shot? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=193.2s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=195.32s)]
*  Never, never. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=196.32s)]
*  I would never do that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=197.32s)]
*  Never. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=198.68s)]
*  You take a hundred yard shot every day. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  Fifty yard shots look like a chip shot. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=202.16s)]
*  Like I shot my elk last week at 50. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=204.52s)]
*  It was easy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=206.32s)]
*  It was perfect. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=207.32s)]
*  It was perfect distance. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=208.32s)]
*  I knew I was going to hit it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=209.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=211.32s)]
*  I've gotten a couple at 50. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=212.32s)]
*  I think one at 60 was my longest shot. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=213.32s)]
*  My friend Cam shot one at two yards. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=216.8s)]
*  He shot it two yards. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=219.88s)]
*  A frontal shot at two yards. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=220.88s)]
*  He just made a video of it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=221.88s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=223.16s)]
*  He was on his knees and the elk was coming up the trail and the elk had no idea he was [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=226.04s)]
*  there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=230.28s)]
*  He was just standing there at full draw. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=231.28s)]
*  And then the elk looked down and saw him there and whap! [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=232.28s)]
*  And it caught him right in the chest. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=235.32s)]
*  It went right through his heart. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=236.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=238.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=239.28s)]
*  This is the video. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=240.28s)]
*  This is a real clip of it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=241.28s)]
*  So he's moving up this trail and this is the elk. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=244.64s)]
*  You'll see the shot. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's very hard to see. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  You'll see it on his YouTube channel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  It's much better, but that's how close he was. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  It was two yards from it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=253.48s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=254.68s)]
*  My first elk I ever shot was with a bow, but it was at like 10 feet. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=256.32s)]
*  So three and a half yards. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=260.76s)]
*  But yeah, it was in a burn area. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=262.76s)]
*  So there was a lot of new growth going on and there was a little quaky tree. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=264.72s)]
*  I saw an elk a couple hundred yards away. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=269.04s)]
*  I called him and he started coming over. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=270.72s)]
*  And then I called again kind of in a different direction. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=273.04s)]
*  So we'd kind of go into a nice little spot. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=276.44s)]
*  I could shoot him and I'm kind of jittery getting my trigger on the loop, my release [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=278.48s)]
*  on there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=285.0s)]
*  And by the time I look up, he's like right on the other side of this quaky 10 feet away [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=286.0s)]
*  from me, you know, just kind of look into see where the cow is and just same thing plugged [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  it right through the middle. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=296.08s)]
*  I've never taken that shot. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=298.08s)]
*  I had an opportunity to do that shot last week at 45 yards, but there was some shit [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=299.52s)]
*  in the way of them. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  And I don't like that shot. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, not at that distance. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  No, that shot's like a 20 and under. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=307.08s)]
*  It passed right through him. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's a devastating shot. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  Just right at an angle. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=313.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's devastating if you hit it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=314.8s)]
*  There's so many videos online of guys hitting that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  It's you know, they just spray blood and die instantly. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  He managed to run 20 yards down down the hill and didn't make it any further. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=324.0s)]
*  It's a great it's a great discipline for fighters. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=330.24s)]
*  A lot of guys who they leave fighting and the excitement and the intensity of fighting, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=334.32s)]
*  nothing can match that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=339.8s)]
*  So the only thing that comes close for a lot of them is bow hunting. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=341.2s)]
*  Yeah, I can see that for sure. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=344.32s)]
*  I mean, I've done it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=346.0s)]
*  I was doing it when I was fighting too. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=347.88s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I grew up hunting, but never really started shooting animals till I get [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=349.56s)]
*  a little bit older. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=356.52s)]
*  Getting a little better at it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=358.52s)]
*  But it's hard. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=359.64s)]
*  I need to get out and bow hunt a little more. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=361.48s)]
*  That's my favorite. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=363.16s)]
*  And Honda's a bow archery El Conte. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=364.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's the most exciting. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=366.56s)]
*  It's also the most crazy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=368.44s)]
*  They're screaming. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=369.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's so much chaos and you got to duck those cows and sneak around. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=370.56s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=375.76s)]
*  I love it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=376.76s)]
*  It's to me. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=377.76s)]
*  It's like the best. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=378.76s)]
*  It's the best way to get meat, first of all. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=379.76s)]
*  And then it's also the best way for me to decompress. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=381.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=384.16s)]
*  You know, and it's really good meat. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=385.16s)]
*  Oh, it's the best meat. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=386.76s)]
*  It's the best meat. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=387.76s)]
*  Yeah, I ate the heart last night. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=388.76s)]
*  Oh, I don't know if I do that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=390.76s)]
*  You don't eat the heart? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=392.92s)]
*  No, it's good, man. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=393.92s)]
*  You just just fry it up. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=395.64s)]
*  I just put salt, pepper and garlic on it and butter and fry it and butter. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=397.2s)]
*  I feel like it would have a different texture. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=400.48s)]
*  It does. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  It's it's chewy, but it's good. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  It tastes good. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=406.0s)]
*  I'm not a fan of liver either. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=407.0s)]
*  I eat the liver, too. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't do it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=409.8s)]
*  It's good for you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=412.08s)]
*  I mean, it's the best meat for you. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=413.48s)]
*  It might be good for you, but it's rough. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=414.88s)]
*  I don't eat too much. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=418.0s)]
*  I ate a couple ounces in the morning with eggs. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=419.0s)]
*  You know, I just slice it up and vacuum seal it and freeze it and then thaw it out. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=422.0s)]
*  For breakfast. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=427.44s)]
*  It's a good breakfast. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=428.68s)]
*  Gets you going. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=430.32s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm not. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=431.2s)]
*  I'm not into that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=432.2s)]
*  Yeah, you're more of a man than me for sure. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=433.2s)]
*  That's definitely not true. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=436.24s)]
*  So how have you adapted to retirement? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=440.16s)]
*  I feel like I'm pretty wet, pretty good. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=443.36s)]
*  It's not like I have the itch to get in there and do it again. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=445.92s)]
*  Occasionally, when I see some of these guys and with with a little bit different style, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=449.44s)]
*  I feel like it would have been fun to match up or see how I do against them. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=455.0s)]
*  You know, I do it in practice, not right with no cameras. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  That'd be, you know, just to see. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=462.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=463.88s)]
*  Would be not not for any type of title or money. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=464.88s)]
*  It would be fun. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=468.12s)]
*  But for a lot of guys, it's so hard to not just resist that urge to come back. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=468.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=474.88s)]
*  I mean, I started wrestling. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=476.12s)]
*  I was five years old and two Olympic teams. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=478.64s)]
*  And then and then I started fighting for and I fought for 20 years. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=482.32s)]
*  So I feel like I did enough. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=486.11999999999995s)]
*  You definitely did enough. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=489.52s)]
*  You did a lot. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  So a lot more than most. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=492.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=494.44s)]
*  Over over that span of time, then most guys compete at that level. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, I felt like. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=500.76s)]
*  I was ready when I retired, I was, you know, honestly, my body felt OK. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=505.32s)]
*  I hadn't really had too many big injuries at all for a while. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=510.2s)]
*  And I just was sleeping, spending too much time on the couch after practice, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=514.88s)]
*  just tired, too tired to do anything else during training camp. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=520.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=524.04s)]
*  So family life was kind of, you know, with the kids and not spending time [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=524.8s)]
*  doing stuff like that was taking a toll. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=529.96s)]
*  So I was like, you know, it's time. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=533.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you did it the right time. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=535.36s)]
*  It's like and it's good that you didn't come back. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  It's just like so many guys come back and you kind of wish they didn't. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=539.48s)]
*  And, you know. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=543.28s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't be one of those guys if I did come back. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=545.08s)]
*  I would it would be I would be. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=547.48s)]
*  I still feel really good. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=551.04s)]
*  So but I don't plan on it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=552.4s)]
*  But nobody's offered me enough money to get off the couch anyway. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=554.44s)]
*  So well, what I'm what I'm interested in seeing is like [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=557.44s)]
*  there's so many different options now with guys, you know, like bare knuckle [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=560.4s)]
*  boxing is nice, you know, a lot of guys going into that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=564.04s)]
*  And I felt like that would be a thing that you would excel at. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=566.92s)]
*  Yeah, I hadn't really watched it until I watched Chad Mendez fight last year. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, man, I like those rules. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=574.92s)]
*  I'd be right up my alley. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=577.24s)]
*  Not like I don't think I would I would do OK at boxing, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=578.56s)]
*  straight boxing, but not that great. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=582.52s)]
*  I would do a lot better at the bare knuckle rules with the dirty boxing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=585.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Hold on to the guy. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=590.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's very different. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=592.36s)]
*  It's I really like what Jorge Masvidal is doing. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=593.48s)]
*  Well, he's got bare knuckle MMA. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=596.8s)]
*  It just shows you that it's like when you don't have, first of all, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=599.12s)]
*  grappling is way better because you don't have the padding over your gloves. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=603.4s)]
*  It prevents certain chokes. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=607.08s)]
*  It's just like it gets in the way stuff. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  But also it's more realistic. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=610.28s)]
*  You know, like your your hands like I think we talked about this before. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=612.4399999999999s)]
*  I think it was Tank Abba was the first guy I figured out [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=616.16s)]
*  that if you wear MMA gloves, you actually could punch harder [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=619.2s)]
*  because you're not worried as much about breaking your hands. Yeah. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=622.48s)]
*  Wrap your hands up, put gloves on. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=625.84s)]
*  And it's not a disadvantage. It's kind of an advantage. Right. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=628.4s)]
*  Yeah. It doesn't necessarily protect your opponent that much. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=631.48s)]
*  It really protects your hands. Right. Now, I agree. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=634.36s)]
*  Yeah. But just seems to me weird that, you know, your elbows [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=637.48s)]
*  are unprotected, your knees are unprotected, your shins are unprotected. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=641.64s)]
*  You can go bone to bone with that, but not with your hands. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=645.28s)]
*  Just seems like it doesn't really make sense. Right. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=647.88s)]
*  And when they when they first started UFC, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=651.84s)]
*  there was no gloves. And and that's how it was. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=655.04s)]
*  Yeah. When they started wearing gloves. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=657.9599999999999s)]
*  And that was my thoughts exactly was more to protect your hands than. Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=659.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, I guess without without your hands, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=666.64s)]
*  if your hands break or fall apart and the fight kind of doesn't happen as well. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=671.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it's interesting to see how effective it is to like Mike Perry [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=675.76s)]
*  has done an amazing job transitioning into bare knuckle. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=680.04s)]
*  Like he's he's probably the most successful at it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=683.76s)]
*  Definitely the most successful at it from MMA guys. Right. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I saw him with with Luke Rockwell. Mm hmm. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=688.52s)]
*  Knock some teeth silly. Yeah. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=691.76s)]
*  I mean, those when it's just raw knuckle on your face, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=693.52s)]
*  like a regular mouthpiece, it's not quite good enough. Right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  And it's interesting that guys are still using the upper mouthpiece [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  only with bare knuckle. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=702.96s)]
*  I would think you might want to use an upper and a lower. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=704.72s)]
*  Yeah, I always just did the upper. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=707.52s)]
*  Yeah, most people do. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=709.48s)]
*  I mean, very few people fought in MMA with an upper and a lower. Right. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=710.92s)]
*  I don't think anybody. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=714.88s)]
*  Not that I know of. Not that I know of. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=715.76s)]
*  In boxing, you used to see it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  You used to see guys who had like a full mouthpiece, but [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  it just gets in the way you're breathing too. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=723.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what that's what I have a problem with. Yeah. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=724.8s)]
*  Did you breathe out of your nose? Can your nose work? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=727.68s)]
*  My nose works fine. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=729.7199999999999s)]
*  A lot of guys, you know. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=731.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I started snoring and so I went and got a sleep test, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=732.8399999999999s)]
*  but they they went in and cleaned it up. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=738.24s)]
*  No, they put a scope up there to see how my nose was because they, you know, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  just like you, they thought my nose couldn't breathe. Right. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=745.2s)]
*  And he said it was completely clear. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=749.08s)]
*  And no, no, it was all good. That's amazing. Yeah. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=750.92s)]
*  It's amazing that you haven't had too many big injuries. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=754.32s)]
*  I know you broke your hand at least once. Right. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=756.8s)]
*  Was that the Vanduulee fight? Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=760.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was a wild one. That was that was. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=763.0s)]
*  In the first round, I broke it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=765.52s)]
*  Well, I just remember going back to the corner, shaking my hands [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  and my hand hurts, and they started talking about something else, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=772.52s)]
*  what I needed to do, and then I never thought about it again. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=775.96s)]
*  The rest of the fight. Wow. And I threw it was throwing it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=778.28s)]
*  So I, you know, just the adrenaline or whatever I had in me [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=782.52s)]
*  just didn't even feel it again. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=787.0s)]
*  You got some wild highlight, real knockouts, some wild fights. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=789.4s)]
*  I remember the first fight I ever saw of yours, I think it was in 1997. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=793.4s)]
*  I think you just posted it on Instagram or someone did. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=798.0s)]
*  It's like me interviewing you backstage. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=801.68s)]
*  Yeah. Right after the fight. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=805.04s)]
*  Ninety seven. That was in 97. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=807.04s)]
*  I think so. Pretty sure. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=809.3199999999999s)]
*  That was when I first started working for the UFC. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=811.0s)]
*  I think that was that was a tournament back then. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=813.52s)]
*  Yeah. What year is that? Does it say? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=816.24s)]
*  Oh, shit. UFC 17. It was 17. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=818.52s)]
*  That was, yeah, 1997. No, 98. 98. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=822.72s)]
*  I fought in 97 in Brazil in a tournament [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  and just to make some money to keep wrestling. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=831.6s)]
*  And then I did the UFC. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=833.9200000000001s)]
*  Who talked you into doing MMA in the first place? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=835.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, Randy and I were training partners forever for wrestling. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=838.6400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, we'd always watched it on TV and said, you know, that'd be fun. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=843.32s)]
*  But I don't know if I'd want to get in there with some of those three, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=848.44s)]
*  400 pounders, you know, right, those big fuckers. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=852.0s)]
*  And Randy called me up one day and said, hey, I'm doing this tournament [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  down in Brazil at heavyweight and they got a lightweight tournament. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=859.24s)]
*  And this is like two weeks before. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=862.0s)]
*  And you want to go do the lightweight tournament, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=864.72s)]
*  which is like it was like 176 or something. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=866.96s)]
*  And I was like, well, OK. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  And I was wrestling 180 and a half at the time. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=872.0s)]
*  So it was an extra five pounds. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=874.6800000000001s)]
*  But, you know, I went down and did it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=877.64s)]
*  But in the meantime, I guess Randy had already put an application into the UFC [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=881.56s)]
*  and they said no, and which I didn't know he put in the application. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=886.76s)]
*  But then he got a call. Somebody got hurt. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  So he didn't go down to Brazil. He went to the UFC instead. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  It was like within a week before a week after that fight. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=897.88s)]
*  No, not that one, but the one down in Brazil, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=901.84s)]
*  which was I think it was UFC 13 was his first one. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=905.24s)]
*  And yeah, I was there for that, too. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=910.0s)]
*  And he had a tournament against the two big heavyweights. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=912.08s)]
*  Yeah. He fought some big muscular guy. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=916.76s)]
*  The first fight had a lot of hype on him. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=919.08s)]
*  And I remember who he fought in the second fight. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=921.4s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=924.9200000000001s)]
*  But that was like when we first started seeing elite wrestlers. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=925.6s)]
*  Right. First started seeing a guy, Royce Alger, you know, Coleman, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=929.4s)]
*  all those. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=933.96s)]
*  And did Kenny Monday fight in the UFC? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=934.72s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Kenny. No. Was it Kevin Jackson? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=938.4s)]
*  Kevin. Kenny Monday fought. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=942.52s)]
*  He fought submission. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=945.24s)]
*  I remember Matt Hume submitted him. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=947.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Remember that? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=949.96s)]
*  I think I wrestled with Frank Chambers. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=951.8s)]
*  That's right. And I had I had a screwed up ankle from I rolled it [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=954.56s)]
*  right before the World Championships a month before that. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=959.76s)]
*  And so I went in there wearing wrestling shoes [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=962.56s)]
*  so I could hide the tape that I had on my ankle. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=965.04s)]
*  Frank's pretty good at ankle lock. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=968.9599999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, that was me not knowing anything about it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=970.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, Frank was really one of the first guys that had like a full overall MMA game. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=973.76s)]
*  Right. No, I agree. Really did. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=979.3599999999999s)]
*  He had a I mean, when he submitted Kevin Jackson, like very impressive. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=981.28s)]
*  He could submit you off his back. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=985.4s)]
*  He had crazy cardio, full range of skills. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=987.5999999999999s)]
*  He could strike. He could grapple. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=990.7199999999999s)]
*  He could do everything right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=992.4s)]
*  And the cardio, he was like one of the first guys that showed [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=993.8s)]
*  like cardio could be a weapon like the Tito Ortiz fight. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=996.36s)]
*  You know, his cardio was a real weapon. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  And Tito's usually in pretty good shape. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1001.52s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Tito learned from that fight. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1003.28s)]
*  I mean, I think that was a big wake up call for him that how much cardio plays a factor. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1006.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And it's a yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1011.56s)]
*  And it's a different pace from wrestling. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  So that was that was something we had to learn. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1016.52s)]
*  You couldn't wrestling was a little bit higher paced, a little more action. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1019.04s)]
*  Shorter, shorter durations. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1022.9599999999999s)]
*  Right. So I had to learn to kind of pace myself a little bit [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  when I first started doing this. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1029.0s)]
*  When you first started doing this, what were the distance of the rounds? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1030.36s)]
*  Was it still was it five minute rounds? No. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1033.2s)]
*  The one down in Brazil, I think, was [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1037.6399999999999s)]
*  a 15 minute straight round and then [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1041.48s)]
*  and then maybe a 15 minute over time. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1045.12s)]
*  If there's no submission, then they go to judges. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1048.32s)]
*  But I mean, I didn't go. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1052.68s)]
*  I think I went like seven or eight minutes. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  The first fight with Crazio was my first fight. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1058.0s)]
*  He was like a black belt, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1061.76s)]
*  which I didn't know a whole lot about after watching that fight again. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1064.88s)]
*  Nowadays, it just, you know, I see so many mistakes that I did. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1069.0s)]
*  And I didn't know how to punch either. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1072.72s)]
*  I was I never sparred before. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1074.24s)]
*  I never sparred before I fought in the UFC on that that one you just put up. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1076.68s)]
*  Never, never. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1080.6799999999998s)]
*  And then we started after that. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1082.04s)]
*  Well, no, I hit the bag and hit focus minutes. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1084.04s)]
*  And, you know, it was just kind of awkward to punch your friend in the face. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1086.52s)]
*  You know, but after that was like me and Randy like, fuck, we need to start sparring. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1091.36s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  You guys didn't spar at all before the first year. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1097.84s)]
*  That is wild. That's wild. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1100.12s)]
*  So I was off balance a lot, you know, get hit, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1103.6399999999999s)]
*  fallen down because, you know, you just it's when you don't spar, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1107.76s)]
*  you're just not you don't have the same balance or. Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  It's just a lot better to practice the way you fight. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  That's so crazy that you fought the first. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1118.28s)]
*  So did you have a striking coach? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1120.6s)]
*  Yeah, we had boxing guys and kind of kickboxing guys that would come in. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1123.08s)]
*  But there was no coaches back then. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1127.4399999999998s)]
*  MMA coaches, right? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1129.6799999999998s)]
*  But and then we just started really [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1131.1999999999998s)]
*  figuring out what what works really well with our styles and, you know, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1134.6799999999998s)]
*  take down offense and, you know, setting up strikes. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1140.84s)]
*  I think the first real MMA coach was probably Milletage, probably Pat. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1144.1999999999998s)]
*  The first guy that had in Matthew. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1149.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Matthew. Good call. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1151.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, those are the first guys that were really putting it all together. Right. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1153.12s)]
*  You know, I mean, and and even back then, guys kind of didn't know exactly [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1157.1599999999999s)]
*  what the right I mean now with you to ATT or one of these big gems. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1162.12s)]
*  I mean, they have protocols. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1165.6s)]
*  They know exactly what they're doing. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1167.6799999999998s)]
*  They have training schedules all mapped out in advance. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1169.28s)]
*  Hard days, easier days, technical days. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1172.08s)]
*  I mean, they really have it down to a science. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1174.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Monitoring recovery. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1176.84s)]
*  It's kind of crazy when you think about your first fight. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1178.9199999999998s)]
*  No sparring at all. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1182.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, my first four fights because there was two fights each. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1185.2399999999998s)]
*  Wow. And then the UFC. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1188.36s)]
*  When you fought Carlos Newton, right? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1191.52s)]
*  Yeah, Carlos Newton and Alan Gales and then Carlos. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1193.9199999999998s)]
*  Two very elite submission guys. Yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1198.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Carlos Newton. People forgot about him. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1202.24s)]
*  That fucking guy was good. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1204.36s)]
*  Yeah. No, he's tough. He was good. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1205.7199999999998s)]
*  Real real brown. He broke my jaw. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1207.84s)]
*  Did he really? Yeah. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1210.08s)]
*  Just like a last minute of the fight, he kind of hit me. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  It didn't daze me or anything. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1214.8s)]
*  But and then, you know, shortly after a few five seconds later, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1216.9599999999998s)]
*  I took him down and when I took him down, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1220.44s)]
*  my chin kind of pushed against his chest and it kind of shifted. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1222.76s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, that doesn't feel right. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1226.6000000000001s)]
*  When did you realize that you had that kind of crazy power? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1232.64s)]
*  Because it's kind of funny that a guy who started out grappling [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1236.96s)]
*  and didn't do any sparring at all for his first four MMA fights [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1241.8s)]
*  was one of the most dangerous strikers in the sport. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1247.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1249.56s)]
*  I mean, I grew up playing baseball and threw really hard. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1251.28s)]
*  And then, you know, when I when I started [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1255.0800000000002s)]
*  and not sparring, started MMA, you know, I hit the pad, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1259.28s)]
*  you know, focus mitts and everybody say, oh shit, you hit hard. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1263.44s)]
*  It's just natural. But yes, I guess it just took me a while [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1267.4s)]
*  to figure out where to put it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1271.28s)]
*  There's a few I think Gomi, I think Takenori Gomi started out as a pitcher, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1273.0800000000002s)]
*  which makes sense. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1277.72s)]
*  You see the way that guy throws punches, just fucking whips his whole body [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1278.56s)]
*  and like a fastball. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1281.8799999999999s)]
*  Put a lot of weight into it. Yeah. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  That's actually probably a great thing to start out with, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1285.04s)]
*  just to learn how to put a lot of force behind your arm. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1288.36s)]
*  Driving with your legs and everything. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1291.6s)]
*  Yeah, it completely makes sense if you think about it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1293.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because you think about how many guys practice medicine balls now, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1296.0s)]
*  you know, they whip medicine balls against the wall to advance your punching power. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1299.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to teach. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1303.96s)]
*  I mean, yeah, you either have power or you don't have power. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1306.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can definitely get better at mechanics to make it harder. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1308.8s)]
*  But not not like what a lot of guys have naturally. Right. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1314.4799999999998s)]
*  Isn't it wild? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  That's a crazy thing, because you can't really tell sometimes by looking at guys. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1320.0s)]
*  Like there's guys that just me. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1324.56s)]
*  Well, you look pretty strong. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1326.3999999999999s)]
*  But there's some guys like they just don't look like they carry that much power, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1328.1599999999999s)]
*  but they have crazy power. Right. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1333.4399999999998s)]
*  It's it's it's weird. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1335.32s)]
*  Power is a weird thing. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1337.28s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1338.4399999999998s)]
*  Like you either have nuclear power or you know, you know. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1339.24s)]
*  And again, I think a lot of that is it is mechanics. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1342.28s)]
*  But a lot of that most mechanics come naturally, like some of those [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1345.8s)]
*  pitchers that can throw the ball so goddamn fast. Yeah. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1351.12s)]
*  And some of them are skinny as fuck. Yeah. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1355.3999999999999s)]
*  How the hell that, you know, they just. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1357.48s)]
*  With that thing around. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1360.36s)]
*  And then there's also your frame, you know, like some guys [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1361.76s)]
*  just have bigger shoulders, bigger hands. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1364.68s)]
*  They're just naturally designed to hit things more and more leverage points. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1366.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's just when you think back, like as a pioneer in the sport, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1370.64s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty wild what you guys did. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1376.48s)]
*  Pretty wild that you entered into the sport, that at the time [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1379.28s)]
*  was just kind of a way to make some money. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1382.16s)]
*  It wasn't there was. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1384.2s)]
*  I mean, when I started doing the post fight interviews, it was banned from cable. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1385.5600000000002s)]
*  The only way you could get it was direct TV. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1390.2s)]
*  I actually got direct TV. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1392.76s)]
*  That's when you started. Yeah. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1394.16s)]
*  Ninety seven because it was [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1395.68s)]
*  I feel like it was right after it wasn't banned from cable yet. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1398.6000000000001s)]
*  Until after I thought I think it was 17. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1404.44s)]
*  One of those one of those years it was banned from cable. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1408.68s)]
*  And there was a lot of shenanigans with like Budweiser. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1411.16s)]
*  And you remember like McCain, McCain was trying to keep it out. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1413.92s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1418.92s)]
*  Human cockfighting. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1420.2s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't a fan of his. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  No, most MMA guys weren't because it was so ridiculous. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1424.68s)]
*  There was no deaths in MMA to speak of. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1428.0400000000002s)]
*  Not like in MMA in boxing, which we have a few every year. Right. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1431.24s)]
*  And they were trying to say it was more dangerous. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1435.7600000000002s)]
*  I'm like, I don't think it is. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1437.7600000000002s)]
*  I don't think it is. I mean, they're all everything's [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1439.72s)]
*  combat sports dangerous to say that MMA is more dangerous. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1442.4s)]
*  Just ignorance. You just didn't understand what was happening. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1446.3600000000001s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1448.8400000000001s)]
*  I have heard that over the years, a lot of different things. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1451.64s)]
*  Yeah. I got nothing bad to say about MMA. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1455.44s)]
*  I mean, I grew up as a wrestler and, you know, kind of competing [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1458.48s)]
*  what I've done my whole life. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1462.44s)]
*  And yeah, I don't feel like it affected me in a bad way at all. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1463.72s)]
*  You know, if anything, it was positive things that made me tougher, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1470.16s)]
*  made me, you know, have more drive and with other things in my life. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1473.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, you're very fortunate that you came out of it on the other end. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1478.04s)]
*  You know, healthy. Yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1480.9199999999998s)]
*  We know guys who have it. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1483.32s)]
*  No, I know. There's a few guys. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1484.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm not saying that it hasn't affected some guys. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1486.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just saying, fortunately, I went through it fairly good. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1489.6399999999999s)]
*  No, you went through a great. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think a lot of it was in Randy's the same way. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1496.6799999999998s)]
*  Just being smart and training a lot of these guys just [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1499.32s)]
*  bang way too much in practice. Yeah. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1503.36s)]
*  And I'm always an advocate of sometimes, not all the time, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1506.24s)]
*  but sometimes in training. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1510.3600000000001s)]
*  If you're training to fight, you have to fight in training. Yeah. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  And how do you know how to manage that? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1515.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think over the years, you know, you just you definitely have one. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1518.6000000000001s)]
*  We have one hard, solid spar day a week [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1523.24s)]
*  and then more technical sparring [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1528.72s)]
*  another day with the big gloves on. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1532.5600000000002s)]
*  And then the other days of the MMA gloves, you know, we're still going hard, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1534.68s)]
*  but not with the striking part, just lighter strikes, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1540.04s)]
*  which, you know, it's kind of hard sometimes. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1544.92s)]
*  Some of these guys, when they go lighter, that they're, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1546.92s)]
*  you know, they slow down their punches instead of, you know, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1549.96s)]
*  keeping your speed there and your timing and [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1552.72s)]
*  just touch and not punch it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1557.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1558.96s)]
*  So that's kind of a hard thing to get used to. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1559.68s)]
*  It took me a while to have that control. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1563.88s)]
*  I would accidentally drop guys a lot in practice [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1566.24s)]
*  because I didn't have control when I was, you know, kind of new to the sport. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1569.44s)]
*  Is there a way that you do now where you train guys to learn how to [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1573.52s)]
*  punch fast, but not hit hard? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1578.0s)]
*  Yeah, you yell at them to, you know, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1580.56s)]
*  don't do it in slow motion. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1583.52s)]
*  Yeah, don't do it in slow motion, but also don't don't. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1584.92s)]
*  You don't need to hit hard, but yeah, don't go slow. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1587.32s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1590.2s)]
*  You just got to remind them because guys just do it naturally. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1591.76s)]
*  What's kind of crazy for you as a pioneer [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1594.76s)]
*  because you guys had to kind of figure it out. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1597.28s)]
*  You feel a pioneer. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1599.68s)]
*  I hear it all the time. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1601.28s)]
*  What's a good word? I don't know. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1602.08s)]
*  But yeah, that is a good word. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1603.56s)]
*  But you just does make me feel you're the definition of a pioneer. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1605.52s)]
*  I mean, UFC 17. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1609.56s)]
*  I mean, come on, man. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1611.72s)]
*  That's a that was back in the dark days. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1613.12s)]
*  Feel like I should have a fucking panda [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1615.96s)]
*  do some gold. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1618.6s)]
*  Headline. Yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1620.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, there's no better word for it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1622.4399999999998s)]
*  But back then, you guys had to kind of learn along the way. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1624.96s)]
*  And as the sport evolved, I've always said this, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1627.9199999999998s)]
*  that there's not a sport that you could ever point to [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1630.4399999999998s)]
*  that has evolved more since 1993 to 2023. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1633.04s)]
*  There's nothing even close. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1638.2s)]
*  You watch fights today like the Makachev Volkonovsky fight. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1639.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, everything's so high level now. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1643.4399999999998s)]
*  Everyone's so good in every aspect of the game. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1645.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1648.52s)]
*  I mean, their first one was a good one. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1649.44s)]
*  That was a I didn't expect that. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1651.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't expect it either. Yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1653.24s)]
*  That guy evolved. He got better. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1654.6000000000001s)]
*  He got better. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1656.52s)]
*  And he figured out a lot of the things that he was doing wrong in that fight [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1657.0s)]
*  and then setting up that head kick with those. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1659.68s)]
*  I thought Bulk was going to get him this. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1661.56s)]
*  I just felt like he had more tools and easier adjustments. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1664.6000000000001s)]
*  Did you ever have to take a fight like that on 10 days notice? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1669.76s)]
*  Because that's what's crazy about it. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1672.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh, so short notice. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1673.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. A number of times, especially in pride. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1675.52s)]
*  That was pretty common. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1677.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, pride. They would just call you up like a week before the fight. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1679.16s)]
*  Right. I thought big nog for he was heavyweight champ at the time. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1682.0s)]
*  Ten days notice. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1687.16s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1689.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there was there was a couple of there was [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1692.64s)]
*  I fought Bustamante on probably a week's notice. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1696.0s)]
*  So when during the pride, two and a half months after [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1699.72s)]
*  knee surgery, a new ACL surgery. No way. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1703.3600000000001s)]
*  They called me up and I was hunting out in Colorado [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1707.32s)]
*  and they tracked me down on my buddy's cell phone up in the mountains and said, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1711.36s)]
*  hey, you need to. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1714.96s)]
*  And I didn't have a contract at the time. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1716.6399999999999s)]
*  And I went ahead and had knee surgery because I tore my knee and and [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1718.8s)]
*  it's like, well, if you don't take the fight, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1723.08s)]
*  we don't know what will happen with any future contracts. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1725.48s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, I'll do it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1728.6s)]
*  But you're paying me win or lose. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1730.96s)]
*  You know, the the win bonus also. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1734.9199999999998s)]
*  And so I took the fight. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1737.6799999999998s)]
*  Luckily, I knocked him out real quick with that knee. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1740.1599999999999s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1745.04s)]
*  And who was that against? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  Bustamante. Bustamante. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1748.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't remember that fight. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1750.48s)]
*  I'm trying to remember. It was after he left. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1751.72s)]
*  After he was just a champ and then left. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1753.36s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1755.3999999999999s)]
*  You fought two and a half months after ACL reconstruction. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1756.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that basically means your ACL was useless. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1759.96s)]
*  Well, I mean. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1763.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was like a minute into the fight. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1764.4799999999998s)]
*  How right. What? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1768.56s)]
*  OK, now I'm remembering that fight. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1770.52s)]
*  See if you can find that fight. You got it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1772.04s)]
*  And I hear it is right here. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1774.12s)]
*  Now, this was which way did they do it? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1776.9199999999998s)]
*  Did they do a cadaver? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1779.6s)]
*  They do a patellar. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1780.9199999999998s)]
*  I did the cadaver because it was a quicker recovery. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1781.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, much quicker. Yeah. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1784.52s)]
*  I did the cadaver on my right knee and I had the patellar tendon on my left knee. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1786.08s)]
*  My right knee was good to go in six months. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1789.76s)]
*  But my left knee, it took like a year before it felt normal. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1792.1999999999998s)]
*  That's crazy. Which knee is it? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1795.84s)]
*  My left, my my lead. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1798.2399999999998s)]
*  And so you're supporting on it. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1800.4799999999998s)]
*  You already threw a kick. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1802.04s)]
*  So you're trusting it. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1803.3999999999999s)]
*  Do you just not think about it once you're in there? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1804.32s)]
*  No. Yeah. I mean, I was I was hiking like 10 miles a day [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1806.04s)]
*  for about four days before they tracked me down up in Colorado. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1811.0s)]
*  So that's crazy, too. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1815.28s)]
*  Luckily, I was, you know, but I was also drinking beer every day. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1816.8s)]
*  Well, that doesn't get you in shape, though. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1820.92s)]
*  The beer doesn't. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1824.48s)]
*  But the the hiking 10 miles a day in the mountains, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1825.2s)]
*  that's actually probably pretty good for your fucking endurance. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1828.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, oh, there it is. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1831.16s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1833.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1837.4s)]
*  That must have been so such a relief to take a fight like that. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1838.88s)]
*  Two and a half months after surgery. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1842.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was definitely a good moment, for sure. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1844.8400000000001s)]
*  I was a little nervous about it because he's a tough dude. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1848.76s)]
*  Yeah, very tough, very tough, too. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1851.04s)]
*  But the funniest thing about that, you know, the one week that I had at home [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1853.0s)]
*  training, I threw like a wide left hook and. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1857.76s)]
*  Dislocated my thumb and it popped out. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1864.28s)]
*  You can see it still screwed up now. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1867.84s)]
*  But when I got there, I'm like, hey, can can I get a shot [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1869.84s)]
*  to numb my thumb before the fight because they can do that there? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1874.52s)]
*  They don't let you do it here. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1877.8799999999999s)]
*  But they're like, yeah, but you got to go to the doctor. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1879.28s)]
*  They'll actually, you know, so I went in there and they got one of those things. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1882.24s)]
*  You can see the chicken x ray of me doing this. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1885.1999999999998s)]
*  There was nothing wrong. And then I'm like, but it [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1887.4399999999998s)]
*  they had the x ray machine where you can see the bones move. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1890.56s)]
*  And it just so weird how the bone just comes right. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1893.08s)]
*  The ligament is gone. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1895.36s)]
*  Oh, so it's still gone. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1896.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's just torn off. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1899.52s)]
*  Yeah, I just by that time, I just taped it for about a year and then it was good. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1901.6799999999998s)]
*  But my other thumb got jammed in the fight. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1908.8s)]
*  Like when I was trying to finish him, it must have. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1911.72s)]
*  Got jammed in my my whole thumb was so swollen, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1915.12s)]
*  so I couldn't even wipe my ass, I couldn't take my pants off. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1918.72s)]
*  I had no thumbs for like a week. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1922.6399999999999s)]
*  So both thumbs were fucked up. Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1924.52s)]
*  God. Yeah. Wow. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1927.4399999999998s)]
*  But yeah, that was the funny part about that. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1929.6s)]
*  The pride days were so wild because did you when [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1932.84s)]
*  when you were under contract with pride, did you just like when an event [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1937.6799999999998s)]
*  was coming up, just prepare like you're probably going to fight in the event [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1940.52s)]
*  because they didn't contact anybody until a couple of weeks out [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1943.84s)]
*  for their New Year's Eve shows. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1947.0s)]
*  You know, I knew that I'd probably be fighting most [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1948.48s)]
*  most likely on most of those shows once they started, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1952.52s)]
*  because that was their big event of the year. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1955.36s)]
*  So I think I did two or three of those. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1959.12s)]
*  So but I was ready to go. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1963.6399999999999s)]
*  The only ones that really that I noticed [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1966.24s)]
*  that was real short notice with those two, you know, gets big nog and then [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1968.72s)]
*  against Bustamante. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1973.08s)]
*  Remember when Bustamante fought Tom Erickson in that one crazy event? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1974.4s)]
*  No, it was one of those no time limit things or like a 30 minute round [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1979.36s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1983.04s)]
*  And Tom Erickson was like a MMA fighter. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1984.12s)]
*  Yeah, grappling. No, it was MMA. It was MMA fight. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1986.56s)]
*  I think it was the same event where Oleg Taktarov fought Hanzo Gracie [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1989.32s)]
*  and Hanzo Gracie KO'd him with an up kick. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1994.08s)]
*  It was like the first time we ever saw an up kick. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1996.28s)]
*  Was that in the UFC? No, no, that was. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=1998.08s)]
*  That was some one off. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2003.28s)]
*  Some of the first few UFCs, they were doing goofy stuff like [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2006.12s)]
*  like they had super long fights, no time limits. Right. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2009.24s)]
*  The first UFC was no time limit each fight, no time limit. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2012.24s)]
*  You just fought and pride had pride had. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2015.9599999999998s)]
*  When I first got to pride, it was two tens. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2019.4399999999998s)]
*  And then they turn it to ten and two fives. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2022.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2024.12s)]
*  Do you like that? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2025.04s)]
*  I think the 10 minute round is a good idea. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2026.08s)]
*  I I liked it because I thought it separated the men from the boys. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2028.04s)]
*  Really. I mean, about seven, eight, nine minutes in. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2032.56s)]
*  You know, guys start breaking. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2036.6s)]
*  Well, also, if you're a grappler and you take a guy down [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2039.08s)]
*  with four minutes into the round and, you know, you've got six minutes [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2042.36s)]
*  to go now instead of one minute. Right. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2046.56s)]
*  You know, if you're you see in the UFC, guys struggle so hard to get a take down [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2048.96s)]
*  and they finally get a take down and then boom rounds over. Right. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2053.0s)]
*  Whereas I just feel like in that situation, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2056.36s)]
*  maybe the right move is to start them in the next round. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2059.28s)]
*  Exactly what you left him off. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2062.48s)]
*  You know, I mean, no, that would I would like that because you think about [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2065.2000000000003s)]
*  the advantage that it is for an elite striker like Alex Behator or something [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2068.7200000000003s)]
*  like that, if you take that guy down and dominate him in the first round [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2072.44s)]
*  and then the second round starts and he has to go right back to side control [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2075.6000000000004s)]
*  or wherever wherever you had him or just do three eight minute rounds [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2078.24s)]
*  or something, something like that. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2081.6s)]
*  Yeah. Three eight minute rounds for a championship round. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2083.08s)]
*  That's for a championship fight. I like that for any fight. Yeah. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2085.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's just I think, you know, Chael Sonnen said this is just like [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2090.2s)]
*  no one can really fight all out for 25 minutes. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2093.4799999999996s)]
*  You got to kind of pace yourself. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2097.3199999999997s)]
*  No. Yeah. And like I said, coming from wrestling to MMA, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2098.7999999999997s)]
*  kind of learn how to pace myself and then, you know, sometimes like my [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2103.0s)]
*  fight against Shogun, which was five rounds, but. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2108.04s)]
*  I got tired because I tried to finish him [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2112.4s)]
*  like in the third round and just fucking shot my wad. Yeah. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2115.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, and that fight was fucking crazy. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2119.36s)]
*  That was a crazy one. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2123.32s)]
*  It was probably more crazy to everybody else watching than it was to me. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2124.44s)]
*  Really? Was that because I don't know, I felt like I dominated him [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2128.0s)]
*  the first three rounds. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2131.92s)]
*  Yeah. Like it wasn't a close decision on those three rounds. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2134.12s)]
*  The fourth round was kind of close. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2139.08s)]
*  So it could have went either way, I thought. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2141.56s)]
*  And then the fifth round, he was on top of me, but he wasn't hurting me at all. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2143.2s)]
*  So I knew he wouldn't finish me. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2147.68s)]
*  In my mind, I knew for sure he wasn't going to finish me, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2150.7599999999998s)]
*  and I already won the fight. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2153.08s)]
*  And, you know, anytime he did hit me, I'd try to get out. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2155.44s)]
*  He just kept mounting me again every time I almost get out. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2160.0s)]
*  I was so tired. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2163.92s)]
*  Well, I want to say crazy in that it was entertaining. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2165.08s)]
*  No, for sure. It was very wildly entertaining fight. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2167.44s)]
*  But a lot of people like, oh, they didn't know what was going to happen [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2170.08s)]
*  if he was going to finish me or not finish me. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2173.52s)]
*  But I knew that he wasn't going to. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2176.4s)]
*  So that's why it wasn't as exciting to me. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  It definitely was a lot, a lot tougher fight than I was hoping for. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2181.92s)]
*  Well, because of trying to empty out the gas tank. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2186.04s)]
*  Yeah, that and and and I thought I'd, you know, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2189.2s)]
*  I don't know if he was coming off injuries in the past [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2193.2799999999997s)]
*  with some of his other fights where he kind of almost quit and [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2196.04s)]
*  and they broke him or finished him. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2198.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I'm like, that was my goal was to go out there [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2202.0s)]
*  and get on him pretty hard and try to break him and finish him. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2205.72s)]
*  He's a guy that I feel like maybe fought a little too long. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2210.2s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. Yeah. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2213.88s)]
*  And he he he definitely [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2215.36s)]
*  he manned up and, you know, it was a lot tougher than I thought he was. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2217.64s)]
*  Oh, he's a tough motherfucker. Yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2222.8399999999997s)]
*  And he was amazing. Yeah. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2224.3599999999997s)]
*  And in pride, he was fucking amazing. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2226.12s)]
*  I think a lot of guys left their best days behind in pride, unfortunately. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2228.24s)]
*  You know, a lot of guys by the time we saw him in the UFC, big nog, crocop. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2233.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's a few of those guys that just the fedor. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2237.4s)]
*  Yeah, the wars that they had in pride were so insane. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2240.44s)]
*  The young kid or didn't have big wars, though, a couple, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2244.0s)]
*  but not no, not where he got hit much. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2247.08s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2249.64s)]
*  I mean, even in the crocop fight, he was basically walking down crocop, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2250.68s)]
*  which is crazy when you think about what an elite striker crocop is. Right. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2253.88s)]
*  Fedor was a motherfucker, dude. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2257.92s)]
*  God damn, that guy was good. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2260.24s)]
*  I feel like some of the referees or something told me, like when [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2261.44s)]
*  when they were in their ref, ref and crocop in the UFC, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2265.64s)]
*  he's out there saying, I'm too old for this shit or I don't, you know, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2269.36s)]
*  why am I here type of thing? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2273.48s)]
*  That's not the attitude you should have when you're out there. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2275.36s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think also [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2277.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know what he was doing when he was in pride. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2280.6400000000003s)]
*  But I know a lot of guys when they're in pride were doing a lot of shit. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2283.08s)]
*  And then they came over to the UFC and also they're getting tested. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2286.48s)]
*  Whereas in pride, they were saying, like, specifically, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2289.8s)]
*  we don't test you for nothing. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2292.44s)]
*  Like Ensign told me, they said it on his contract. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2293.56s)]
*  They did P test, but I'm not sure what they tested for. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2296.36s)]
*  They didn't do anything with it. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2299.04s)]
*  They just want to make sure you're on steroids. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2300.48s)]
*  Yeah. I asked them if they would. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2302.56s)]
*  Or when the, you know, the answer I got, well, if we did that, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2305.6800000000003s)]
*  it would be you and no, Gary would be the only fighters we'd have. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2308.88s)]
*  Yeah, I always wondered. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2313.6800000000003s)]
*  I always wondered, like how much of what you saw was guys that were sauced up. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2315.08s)]
*  We know some guys were sauced up for sure. Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2319.4s)]
*  I think a lot of sports have that evolution in there, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2322.4s)]
*  before, you know, before they get big enough to be concerned about that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2325.48s)]
*  They're already doing it. Yeah. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2330.52s)]
*  Well, then there was the testosterone replacement era. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2333.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I was the first one to get on that. Yeah. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2336.72s)]
*  And I was like, there's no way I'm doing it. I don't want to do that. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2339.72s)]
*  And, you know, the doctor's like, well, you'd feel a lot better. And [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2343.56s)]
*  and I asked the athletic commission if I even could. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2348.12s)]
*  They're like, yeah, if you get a doctor's prescription and, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2351.48s)]
*  you know, they say you need it. No problem. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2354.8s)]
*  I was like, oh, really? OK. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2356.72s)]
*  And then everybody started kind of abusing that. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2358.48s)]
*  They abuse the shit out of it. For everybody. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2360.76s)]
*  Well, those days, the Vitor days, everybody talks about TRT Vitor. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2362.6s)]
*  Because testosterone replacement Vitor was fucking Jesus Christ. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2366.96s)]
*  He was when I found him in pride, he tested positive in Vegas. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2371.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, really? Because we were in Vegas. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2374.8399999999997s)]
*  Their first pride event in Vegas. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2377.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, you were one of the only guys who didn't show a performance [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2380.64s)]
*  decline when you got off of it. Right. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2383.8399999999997s)]
*  No, I didn't. I wasn't taken much. But [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2385.92s)]
*  but I was and I always even when they weren't testing me. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  Like they do now, they randomly show up. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2393.72s)]
*  And I was asking for the UFC to do that for years, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2396.72s)]
*  even though now they're getting rid of it. But well, they're getting rid of it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2399.9199999999996s)]
*  But they're implementing some sort of a new program called Drug Free Sport. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2403.08s)]
*  But I don't know what that means. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2406.7599999999998s)]
*  They might. But their logo might be a wink. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2407.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on how much money you're making. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2411.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think they wanted a little bit more control. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2414.24s)]
*  Of when the tests were going on, because you saw it would show up [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2417.8s)]
*  at six o'clock in the morning and test guys on weigh in days and shit like that. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2420.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, and I had I had to deal with that when I wrestled [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2424.08s)]
*  for, you know, on the national team. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2429.0s)]
*  Top three guys are subjected to that as well. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2430.96s)]
*  And I had that for years. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2433.48s)]
*  You know, and then, you know, I started. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2435.84s)]
*  That's why I was like, oh, I don't want to do that. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2439.16s)]
*  But they're like, oh, you can. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2440.88s)]
*  But I would test myself at least once or twice every training camp [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2442.6s)]
*  so I could if anybody questioned me or how I was doing it, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2446.36s)]
*  I could show that I'm not abusing it. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2451.48s)]
*  This is what my levels were during training camp. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2454.24s)]
*  So I did that all on my own just because [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2457.32s)]
*  even though I would only get tested by them at the fight. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2461.88s)]
*  Did you have to do anything differently once you got off of it, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2465.32s)]
*  once they removed the TRT exemptions? No. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2468.56s)]
*  You do anything different? Just stop taking it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2472.04s)]
*  No, just a lot of that shit's in your head anyway. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2473.88s)]
*  So I was like, I'm just at that time. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2477.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I didn't. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2481.8s)]
*  I'm sure that I was a little bit affected, but I felt like, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2482.92s)]
*  yeah, I could push through it. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2486.08s)]
*  No problem. And I did. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2487.2000000000003s)]
*  And and as I got older, though, like like in my early 40s, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  mid 40s, I really started [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2495.2400000000002s)]
*  feeling the the age a little bit as far as just not recovering. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2498.44s)]
*  Did you adjust your training to handle that? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2504.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would I would [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2507.4s)]
*  I made my training camps like a month longer, three weeks longer, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2509.6s)]
*  just to kind of ease into it [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2513.6800000000003s)]
*  and not not really go real hard for the first two, three weeks [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2516.6400000000003s)]
*  and then really start a hard training camp and then taper off a little bit better. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2521.1600000000003s)]
*  But just a little bit shorter practices with more intensity. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2525.96s)]
*  And so going back to being a pioneer, I know you hate that word, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2531.2400000000002s)]
*  but you really are. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2534.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2535.6000000000004s)]
*  How did you guys figure out what's the best way to train? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2536.28s)]
*  Like who helped you put together camps like [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2540.36s)]
*  because you're going from this one discipline, wrestling, which you excel that. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2544.2000000000003s)]
*  And now you're competing in MMA and there's so many different ways to do it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2547.7200000000003s)]
*  And nobody really knew exactly the right way to do it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2550.7200000000003s)]
*  There was a lot of like different camps are doing it different ways. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2553.2400000000002s)]
*  How did you guys figure out? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2556.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I think. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2558.92s)]
*  You know, knowing how much there was to learn in the sport, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2561.1600000000003s)]
*  you couldn't we kind of broke it up into different categories. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2566.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, one day we're going to spar hard when, you know, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2571.52s)]
*  but we also needed to learn how to grapple on the ground. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2573.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, how to how to use our wrestling to control certain positions. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2578.28s)]
*  So I think just knowing that we didn't spend every day [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2583.08s)]
*  sparring hard or, you know, three, four days a week sparring hard [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2588.12s)]
*  because we needed to learn the other shit, too. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2592.08s)]
*  So I think it just naturally went that way. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2593.72s)]
*  And and then as we got more older, a little bit older [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2597.4s)]
*  and more experienced in the sport, you know, kind of fine tune that a little bit. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2601.12s)]
*  On certain days, we do certain harder things and [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2607.6s)]
*  really try not to beat your brain up too much. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2611.72s)]
*  Every day, just one day, maybe. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2616.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of it's interesting that even today [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2617.72s)]
*  there's different schools of thought like Sean Strickland spars [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2620.4399999999996s)]
*  basically every day, whereas Max Hollis was at my gym for like three years. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2623.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Was he? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2627.72s)]
*  It's a wild boy. Yeah. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2629.3999999999996s)]
*  Kind of had to let him go. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2631.52s)]
*  Oh, did you? The crazier days. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2634.56s)]
*  Yeah. Now he just kind of [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2637.3599999999997s)]
*  gets too involved talking shit about people. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2639.7999999999997s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2644.3999999999996s)]
*  I liked him in the gym. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2645.24s)]
*  I liked him there. He was a great training partner. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2647.16s)]
*  And you need at least one guy. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2648.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And your gym that that does that and goes hard [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2651.7999999999997s)]
*  and makes everybody else go hard. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2656.16s)]
*  Yeah. When they're going against them. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2657.9199999999996s)]
*  So I liked it, but. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2660.3599999999997s)]
*  Other people didn't. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2663.04s)]
*  Yeah, he just, you know, he just was too disrespectful to teammates and stuff. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2664.24s)]
*  As the young Sean Strickland. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2671.48s)]
*  Yeah. No, this is well, you know, I definitely see that. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2673.6s)]
*  And, you know, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2676.68s)]
*  you know, always rooted for him when he left. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2678.88s)]
*  You know, it wasn't like I was like, I hope that, you know, right now, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2680.92s)]
*  I always rooted for him. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2683.8399999999997s)]
*  I thought he had a ton of potential. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2685.16s)]
*  I was yelling at him to go up a weight class because he was always trying to make one seventy. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2687.2s)]
*  My dude, you need to go one eighty five. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2692.64s)]
*  You feel a lot better. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2695.8399999999997s)]
*  You you compete just the you'd be fine competing up there. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2697.16s)]
*  But everybody's always mentally afraid to be against the bigger guys. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2700.84s)]
*  Yeah, he's a different fighter at one eighty five than he was at one. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2706.0s)]
*  And one seventy, you can see he was compromised. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2708.84s)]
*  Just like how I mean, he had to cut 25 pounds easy. Right. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2711.0s)]
*  Yeah. Now he's big. He's way too big for one seventy. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2714.92s)]
*  But when you saw his fight without us on, we shocked. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2718.5600000000004s)]
*  I I only saw parts of that. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2722.2400000000002s)]
*  I didn't really think I was somewhere else. I didn't get to see it. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2724.48s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. Yeah. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  No, I saw parts of it. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2728.52s)]
*  And yeah, he he looked great. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2730.4s)]
*  He looked fucking amazing. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2732.52s)]
*  The crazy thing is how good his defense is. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2733.96s)]
*  I thought he would do well against him. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2736.0s)]
*  I didn't think he'd do well just standing up with him. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2737.92s)]
*  I mean, I thought on your side, it would get would out point him a little bit. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2741.72s)]
*  But I thought Sean would take him down and beat the shit out of him if he got on top. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2747.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, that's a lot of people don't realize Sean has a very good ground game. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2751.52s)]
*  No, very good. Yeah, very good. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2754.4s)]
*  He just doesn't use it very often. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2756.08s)]
*  Black belt, jujitsu, good wrestling, good takedown defense. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2757.92s)]
*  You know, he's solid everywhere, but he just loves to bang. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2761.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. Just stand in front of you doesn't have like huge power. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2764.6800000000003s)]
*  It's probably getting better at putting it in better places now. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2769.0s)]
*  But he wasn't like it's not a big knockout guy, but he definitely adds him up. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2774.28s)]
*  And really, he's by far one of the biggest pressure fighters. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2779.32s)]
*  Yeah. It just moves forward all the time. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2785.48s)]
*  Well, he's also able to do that because of his defense. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2788.04s)]
*  His defense is so hard to get. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2790.8s)]
*  Yeah, so underrated. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2792.76s)]
*  And in that Adesanya fight, you saw it so clearly. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2794.2400000000002s)]
*  He's really hard to hit. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2796.96s)]
*  So good at moving just out of distance and then putting more pressure back on you. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2798.1600000000003s)]
*  Checking those those calf kicks. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2802.6000000000004s)]
*  He's quick. Yeah. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2804.6400000000003s)]
*  I was I was super impressed with that. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2806.48s)]
*  Yeah. And it's even more impressive, you know, coming back from an accident like he had to. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2808.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And he talks about it. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2813.96s)]
*  It's like my quads all fucked up on his right leg. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2815.28s)]
*  Like his one leg is just like the quads not even attached. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2817.88s)]
*  Yeah. Which is nuts. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2821.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's but again, it just shows what the body can do if you just let it. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2824.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. You know, if you're just mentally tough enough to push through something. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2829.4s)]
*  Well, he changed his style a little bit because of it. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2834.08s)]
*  You know, he stands different than most people stands very straight up. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2836.84s)]
*  He always has. Yeah, always. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2840.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. When I spar, I might have to. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2843.08s)]
*  I quit aiming for his head. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2845.72s)]
*  I just aim for his chest and it kind of stopped him. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2848.44s)]
*  And then I could, you know, follow up. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2851.8799999999997s)]
*  If I hit him in the chest, I could follow up and hit him again. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2854.08s)]
*  But he's hard to hit. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2856.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's impressive. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2859.52s)]
*  And he's the only guy doing that sort of Philly shell style at a championship level. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2860.8799999999997s)]
*  It's like very interesting seeing him out there. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2865.3599999999997s)]
*  He looks different than everybody else. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2867.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, he's quick. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2869.52s)]
*  That really helps him not get hit. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2872.16s)]
*  Also, yeah, but just also, I think when we're going back to the different schools [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2873.6s)]
*  of thought in terms of sparring, he spars every day. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2877.2799999999997s)]
*  It's most of his training sparring. Right. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2879.92s)]
*  So when you see him fight out of Sonia in the fifth round, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2882.4s)]
*  the guy wasn't even breathing heavy. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2886.48s)]
*  I mean, he looked like ready to go five more after that. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2887.96s)]
*  He's got like just his natural abilities, his cardio [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2891.36s)]
*  among, you know, you know, how to fight well, too. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2897.08s)]
*  But naturally, he just has cardio for days. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2899.4s)]
*  Well, I got to think that has a lot to do with constantly sparring. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2904.08s)]
*  So the sparring thing is not there's not a lot of tension, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2907.32s)]
*  very loose and very composed and very efficient. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2910.6s)]
*  Whereas some guys like. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2915.56s)]
*  But then again, you look at Max Holloway, he's about as good as it gets. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2917.96s)]
*  And that guy doesn't spar at all anymore. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2920.84s)]
*  He says, I don't want to get beat up. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2922.6800000000003s)]
*  He shouldn't. Yeah. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2924.1600000000003s)]
*  He just says, especially the way his fights are now. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2925.48s)]
*  Typically wars, you know. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2928.52s)]
*  Oh, he's got some fucking crazy wars, crazy wars, crazy wars. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2929.8s)]
*  But he's like, I want to go into those fights fresh. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2933.48s)]
*  And I think that was something that he picked up during training camps. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2936.12s)]
*  So like some of the training camps where he sparred a lot. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2938.88s)]
*  He was a little beat up by the time he actually got into the octagon. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2941.08s)]
*  And so now he's like, look, I already know how to fight. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2944.84s)]
*  So I'll just do drills and hit mitts and pads and constant conditioning. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2946.84s)]
*  And it works. Right. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2950.84s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2953.52s)]
*  But that's what's interesting is like, there's no one perfect way to do it. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2954.68s)]
*  It depends upon the athlete, depends upon the skill set. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2958.84s)]
*  Right. No, for sure. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2962.16s)]
*  And, you know, you could like I said, certain days to do certain things [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2963.72s)]
*  because of, you know, how tough certain things are in certain days. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2968.84s)]
*  And you want to go hard, then you want to kind of take it easy for a day. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2973.16s)]
*  Easier, I should say, but [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2977.2s)]
*  it doesn't work for everybody. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2980.04s)]
*  Some guys just need need a little bit more. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2981.8s)]
*  Some guys need less. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2984.56s)]
*  Do you think that's something that you just need to tune in on your own [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2986.12s)]
*  with a coach and with the people that you work with and just figure it out [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2989.24s)]
*  over time, multiple camps? Yeah, I guess. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2992.72s)]
*  But I mean, for the most part, you get [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=2995.7599999999998s)]
*  what you get put into it out of it. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3000.4s)]
*  So if if someday one day you're not feeling it, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3002.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, you kind of get in there and you get lazy. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3006.92s)]
*  You might get beat up a little bit. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3008.88s)]
*  But that means you're having to push through [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3010.16s)]
*  some adversity to kind of keep going, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3015.08s)]
*  which is also a good thing in training to have to do some days. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3017.44s)]
*  And and on the flip side, you might feel great someday. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3022.4s)]
*  And you're the one beating the other guy up in practice. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3025.92s)]
*  And and I think it's good for the guys to get beat up [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3028.56s)]
*  to have to see how they respond to that. Right. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3032.84s)]
*  And to have that experience once you actually get in the fight. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3035.92s)]
*  Because it's definitely going to happen in a fight. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3039.16s)]
*  What do you think was your toughest fight? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3042.52s)]
*  Do you have a toughest fight? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3044.92s)]
*  I have a toughest night of fighting. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3046.32s)]
*  That was when I did that tournament, the rings tournament, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3048.4s)]
*  the 32 man unlimited weight class tournament. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3051.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3055.28s)]
*  How many times did you fight that night? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3057.92s)]
*  Well, the first event I fought twice [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3059.84s)]
*  and then I came back and fought three times in a night [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3062.84s)]
*  for the for the how much of a gap between the first two fights in the. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3067.2400000000002s)]
*  So I thought Gilbert Yvel rival, whatever his name is. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3071.76s)]
*  The first fight that night and had about an hour, probably, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3076.88s)]
*  which is pretty good. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3081.28s)]
*  Forty five minutes to an hour. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3082.8s)]
*  And then I fought Big Nog. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3084.76s)]
*  And he fucked my knee up. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3088.48s)]
*  He we're in the clinch and he jumps to guard [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3091.48s)]
*  and his ass landed on my leg and just popped my MCL. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3094.32s)]
*  So my leg really hurt. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3099.4s)]
*  My knee did. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3100.96s)]
*  I made it through that fight, beat him. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3102.44s)]
*  And then I had about 20 minutes, 25 minutes. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3104.96s)]
*  There's one fight in between. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3108.52s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3110.08s)]
*  And then I had to fight Babalu in the finals. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3111.36s)]
*  And Randy was in my corner and Ryan Parsons and and there I [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3113.64s)]
*  I find out afterwards that like, oh, there's no. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3119.92s)]
*  He's going to be able to fight. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3122.28s)]
*  He was I was just a bucket of shit out there in the locker room. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3124.44s)]
*  It hurt. And then. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3128.36s)]
*  You know, but that fight, I had never made that much money. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3132.76s)]
*  It was kind of it was this was in the year 2000. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3136.84s)]
*  So I think the most I had [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3139.56s)]
*  ever made from wrestling, you know, and with everything combined [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3143.2400000000002s)]
*  was when I fought the UFC the year before that made like 20 grand. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3146.7200000000003s)]
*  This final fight was worth 200 grand. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3151.56s)]
*  Wow. Just the winner lose. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3154.8s)]
*  It was a two hundred thousand dollar difference. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3157.1200000000003s)]
*  Just the one fight. Yeah. The finals. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3159.2400000000002s)]
*  The champ got everything. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3162.0s)]
*  It was basically winner take all type of thing. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3163.0s)]
*  If I would have taken second place, I would have had five fights [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3165.5600000000004s)]
*  for about 30 grand total. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3168.2000000000003s)]
*  And I made 230 grand instead. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3172.04s)]
*  And then that's yeah. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3174.6400000000003s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, when I went out there and they play [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3176.2400000000002s)]
*  the national anthem beforehand, I got me pumped up, ready to go. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3179.2400000000002s)]
*  And the thought of two hundred thousand dollars. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3182.9199999999996s)]
*  Did you tape your knee up or anything? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3185.3999999999996s)]
*  I know. I mean, there wasn't really much time. And [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3187.44s)]
*  I just went out there and fought kind of defended takedowns and. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3191.3999999999996s)]
*  And this tournament was they had a little bit different rules. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3197.56s)]
*  It was it was two fives. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3201.3999999999996s)]
*  And the kind of like the ultimate fighter [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3205.0s)]
*  and a possibility of another five if it's if it's a draw. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3207.68s)]
*  And Babalu was a fucking stud, too. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3211.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he was him and both him and Noguer were both pretty big, like [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3213.4s)]
*  like 40 pounds bigger than me. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3218.56s)]
*  Babalu had one of the most horrific chaos early in his career. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3220.92s)]
*  He fought Brad Kohler and he soccer kicked him [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3225.08s)]
*  with wrestling shoes on. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3228.48s)]
*  Remember those days? I remember that. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3230.2799999999997s)]
*  Brad Kohler was like a bodybuilder. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3233.72s)]
*  He was a. Yeah, I remember him. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3235.48s)]
*  He was a tank. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3236.92s)]
*  And Babalu stuffed his shots and got him down [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3238.2s)]
*  and soccer kicked him into the next realm. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3242.08s)]
*  Who? Yeah, I think I remember that. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3245.2s)]
*  Yes, even if I'm the Babalu was an animal. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3249.08s)]
*  Very. Yeah, no, he was tough. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3251.68s)]
*  Him and Noguerra. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3253.04s)]
*  Up to the time I when I had fought them, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3255.72s)]
*  they submitted everybody in the tournament that they fought so far. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3258.3599999999997s)]
*  So Noguerra had had here. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3262.6s)]
*  Finished three guys. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3265.4399999999996s)]
*  He hit him with a lot of low kicks. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3268.04s)]
*  That was back in the wrestling shoes days. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3269.52s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3272.36s)]
*  The difference when your amount of grip that you have with wrestling shoes. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3274.0s)]
*  Big fucking difference, right? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3277.6s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3279.76s)]
*  Yeah, Babalu is super high level. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3282.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's he was tough. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3286.92s)]
*  So here it is. He gets him right here. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3289.08s)]
*  Boom. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3291.08s)]
*  Soccer kick. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3294.56s)]
*  What show is that in? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3295.76s)]
*  Is that in Brazil? I don't know. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3297.16s)]
*  I don't remember 2000. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3299.2799999999997s)]
*  What does it say? World Extreme Fighting. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3302.2799999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3306.68s)]
*  Was just January 15th of 2000, just different fucking rules. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3309.3999999999996s)]
*  About a month later is when I fought him in that tournament. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3314.16s)]
*  I think it was like February, the King of Kings finals. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3317.3999999999996s)]
*  World Extreme Fighting going plow. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3321.3199999999997s)]
*  Jen's Pulver was in there. No shit. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3322.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3325.56s)]
*  That Phil Johns did looks like Justin Gagey. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3327.24s)]
*  He does. I thought it was the first. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3329.56s)]
*  Oh, Pele fought fucking Pat Miletich. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3331.24s)]
*  I forgot about that fight, too. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3334.12s)]
*  John Lewis, Jeremy Horn. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3336.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3338.52s)]
*  No, Gara. Yeah. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3339.52s)]
*  Roger Rodriguez. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3341.52s)]
*  Yeah. Matt Hughes was in there. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3344.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3347.52s)]
*  Bunch of legends. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3349.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3351.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3352.8s)]
*  Just those days, man, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3356.6s)]
*  that, you know, that's never going to happen again, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3359.16s)]
*  where you have just to be the emergence of a sport like this [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3361.64s)]
*  that becomes one of the biggest sports in the world. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3365.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think they should do tournaments again. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3367.36s)]
*  You think so? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3370.0s)]
*  Multiple fights in it in a night. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3370.88s)]
*  It would be wild. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3373.28s)]
*  I think they should start doing that. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3374.48s)]
*  And then it kind of gears it up to be an Olympic sport after that. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3376.08s)]
*  What do you do, though, if you have injuries? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3380.28s)]
*  Like, what if? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3384.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, I think I think you got to tame down the rules a little bit. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3385.0400000000004s)]
*  But there's typically alternates when they do any MMA tournament. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3389.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. But they have an alternate. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3393.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, if someone like, say, if you have a war against one, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3395.0s)]
*  like, say if say if you have a war against somebody and then the [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3398.76s)]
*  in the next round, the guy who also fought, he has to pull out. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3403.44s)]
*  And then they put in an alternate and he's fresh. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3406.88s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, but they make the alternates fight. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3409.68s)]
*  Oh, do they? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3413.12s)]
*  Like my thought was to say it was an alternate fight. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3414.2s)]
*  Oh, I see. I see. So the alternate fight actually could have fought again that night. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3417.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm thankful I did. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3421.3599999999997s)]
*  And I didn't have any thumbs in a blown out skinny knee. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3422.3999999999996s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, that would work. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3428.2799999999997s)]
*  That would work. Will you have a potential alternate? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3430.04s)]
*  You might need to. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3432.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, if you needed the other guy, I guess you would take the loser. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3433.96s)]
*  The alternate. Yeah, I guess. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3437.7999999999997s)]
*  I guess you would, unless you got KO'd. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3439.72s)]
*  Well, even in some words. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3442.2s)]
*  Right. If it's in Japan, like dust him off, put some ice on his head. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3444.3199999999997s)]
*  It's just is it is interesting when you see tournaments, though, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3450.04s)]
*  because it's like you have a built in super fight, right? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3454.6s)]
*  You have you see over the night guys winning and you know their style. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3457.6s)]
*  And so you're looking forward to the matchup when it comes to the main event. Right. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3462.24s)]
*  I mean, that was the early UFC. Right. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3465.96s)]
*  Yeah, I thought UFC 17 was tournament. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3468.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, the tournaments were wild. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3472.44s)]
*  The first one I went to was UFC 12. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3474.6400000000003s)]
*  That was when Vitor fought Trey Tellegman and then he fought Scott Feroz. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3476.92s)]
*  And he won the heavyweight tournament. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3481.88s)]
*  News 19. Right. Yeah. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3483.4s)]
*  And Randy came in after that. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3486.36s)]
*  I just don't. Yeah. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3487.92s)]
*  Randy was that that was back when Vitor was like 240 when he fought Randy. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3489.32s)]
*  He looked like his trap started at the top of his ears. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3493.1200000000003s)]
*  He had a little bitty head on top of a huge body. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3497.0s)]
*  He was crazy big. He was so bulked up. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3501.0s)]
*  But I just wonder, like what athletic commissions would allow you to do that? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3503.84s)]
*  I know Los Angeles just a few years ago [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3507.52s)]
*  when they had glory last man standing, they had a big tournament there. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3511.48s)]
*  It was a big kickboxing tournament. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3514.8s)]
*  Yeah. I wonder if they would allow something like that [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3516.52s)]
*  with some athletic commissions with MMA. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3519.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3522.68s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't see why they wouldn't. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3523.32s)]
*  I mean, be exciting. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3527.44s)]
*  You could tame it down a little bit, kind of like they do the ultimate fighter. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3529.4s)]
*  But, you know, have it all in one night, not over. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3532.96s)]
*  Right. Time. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3538.76s)]
*  Well, it certainly would be exciting. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3540.84s)]
*  I think the options that would be interesting are one 15 minute round [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3542.6400000000003s)]
*  instead of three fives. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3547.6000000000004s)]
*  I think that would be very interesting. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3548.8s)]
*  And then a tournament that would also be very interesting. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3550.4s)]
*  If they decided to do I mean, if someone wants to stand out [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3553.16s)]
*  for another organization like the PFL or one of those like the PFL [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3555.6s)]
*  has got some weird point system that they do that I don't really understand. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3559.2s)]
*  You get a certain amount of points for a submission, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3563.2s)]
*  a certain amount of points for a KO. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3565.36s)]
*  And it's like you're ahead in the score. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3567.2s)]
*  Is that like to go for the whole season to see where you're ranked? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3570.12s)]
*  And then, yeah, it's it's not the whole season was a tournament. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3574.08s)]
*  Anyway, I guess it's only certain weight classes or the whole. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3577.96s)]
*  It's certainly it's weight classes. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3581.16s)]
*  Well, I don't know if they do it with all weight classes, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3583.0s)]
*  but I think that's just how they they run their organization. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3585.76s)]
*  I hope they stop doing that. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3589.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, they're now going to own Bellator. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3591.36s)]
*  Yeah, which is interesting. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3594.48s)]
*  They got a lot of cash, apparently. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3596.7200000000003s)]
*  A lot of oil money going that direction. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3599.04s)]
*  A lot of investor money. Yeah. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3601.52s)]
*  Listen, the more big organizations, the better, I think, for for the athletes, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3603.92s)]
*  for sure, for the fans, for sure. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3608.6800000000003s)]
*  And they have Francis Ngono, you know, Francis Ngono [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3610.84s)]
*  becomes their heavyweight, you know, poster guy. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3613.8s)]
*  And, you know, he's their heavyweight champion. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3616.32s)]
*  It could be very interesting if they throw a bunch of money on it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3618.52s)]
*  No, I agree. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3620.92s)]
*  I think it's great for the sport and, you know, great for that. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3621.88s)]
*  The fighters, yes, definitely great for the fighters. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3625.76s)]
*  The fighters can't just have the UFC. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3628.36s)]
*  And it's good for the UFC, too. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3630.4s)]
*  Everybody needs competition. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3631.8s)]
*  You know, the UFC needs the and it's great for the fighters. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3633.6400000000003s)]
*  If you got the PFL bidding on you, you got one championship [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3637.52s)]
*  bidding on you and you got the UFC bidding on you, that's a good place to be. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3640.52s)]
*  Well, for sure. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3643.52s)]
*  If there's only the UFC around, you got to take what they give you. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3644.36s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I was kind of in that boat for a bit [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3647.64s)]
*  when the UFC bought pride and then, yeah, I was in the UFC again. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3650.36s)]
*  And then the strike force came along and I went there and then they bought. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3654.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3659.24s)]
*  That's what I told the press. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3660.68s)]
*  I said, Dana is like a stalker. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3661.7599999999998s)]
*  He loves me so much. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3666.68s)]
*  You got to buy the companies. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3667.72s)]
*  I'm going to. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3669.16s)]
*  You remember Affliction? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3672.08s)]
*  They were out for a hot minute. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3673.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that I think they basically broke the bank when. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3675.76s)]
*  Josh Barnett tested positive, he was going to fight Fador in the fight. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3680.52s)]
*  They just canceled the whole event. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3684.48s)]
*  Yep. And never had another show. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3686.08s)]
*  Dana didn't know about it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3688.04s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he was gambling. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3689.44s)]
*  I think he was playing blackjack and I texted him and I said, hey, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3691.08s)]
*  did you hear what's going on? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3695.56s)]
*  I go, Josh Barnett tested, and then he called me up. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3697.16s)]
*  He goes, what the fuck's going on? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3699.16s)]
*  And then I told him, he's like, holy shit. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3700.16s)]
*  He was so happy. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3702.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he was so happy. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3707.0s)]
*  It would have been nice for I think Trump was getting ready to be involved as a [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3708.56s)]
*  he was at the event to watch or he was at the previous event to watch. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3712.96s)]
*  And I think they were kind of grooming them to be an investor. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3718.52s)]
*  Interesting. That would have been interesting. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3721.04s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, those back when everybody loved Trump. Yeah. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3723.12s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3727.52s)]
*  Boy, boy, the fucking things change. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3730.04s)]
*  He was in all the rap songs. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3732.3999999999996s)]
*  Rappers would always talk about Trump. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3734.12s)]
*  Everybody loved Trump. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3735.8799999999997s)]
*  It was like this wheel and deal and billionaire character that everybody enjoyed. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3737.56s)]
*  Yeah. I felt like he did a decent job as president. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3742.68s)]
*  When you look at his regulations, it certainly helped the economy. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3747.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, that guy who was like, we were in a lot better spot then than now, for sure. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3750.96s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3755.12s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of shit happened. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3756.16s)]

*  Like, there's no good solutions to the Middle East. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3774.72s)]
*  All of it looks terrible. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3777.2799999999997s)]
*  And the Ukraine thing looks terrible. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3778.96s)]
*  It just it just scares the shit out of me because it's just like [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3782.48s)]
*  all it takes is one person to fucking launch a nuke. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3785.08s)]
*  And the world changes forever. Right. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3789.24s)]
*  And I've never felt like that was a possibility in my lifetime until now. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3791.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, this is it is a little bit on the unsure realm of how I've, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3796.04s)]
*  you know, I feel definitely [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3802.56s)]
*  a little bit unsure about what what's going to happen. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3805.16s)]
*  Yeah. Very. Yeah. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3807.7999999999997s)]

*  Like where's going to be safe from the fallout? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3813.08s)]
*  Do some more research on aliens. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3815.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Where the next vacation spot is. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3818.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, that would be fascinating if the aliens come down and stop at all. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3821.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. They just can't listen to dipshits. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3825.2799999999997s)]
*  We've been watching, waiting. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3827.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like the way I describe it is like two brothers fighting in the backyard. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3829.7999999999997s)]
*  The parents like, hang on, let them fucking work this out [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3833.16s)]
*  and just figure out when one of them grabs a rock and run in. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3836.68s)]
*  OK, I know that's enough. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3840.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3843.24s)]
*  Just I've never felt more like the world's [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3844.6s)]
*  on the verge of being forever ruined. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3848.04s)]
*  This is what it feels like right now. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3851.3599999999997s)]
*  Just feels like I've never felt more like we're on. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3853.44s)]
*  I mean, this is must have been what it felt like at the [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3856.48s)]
*  at the beginning of World War Three or World War Two, rather. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3860.44s)]
*  Don't say three. I know. I'm sorry. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3864.16s)]
*  For the end slip. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3867.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's it's fucked. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3869.04s)]
*  So what have you been up to other than [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3873.52s)]
*  obsessing over hunting? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3876.48s)]
*  That's the that's my main hobby these days. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3878.68s)]
*  But other than that, you know, running the club. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3881.6s)]
*  We have this comedy club that you went to last night. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3885.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I was impressed. It was pretty cool. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3887.16s)]
*  Thank you. It's been fun. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3889.48s)]
*  That's that's a nice thing, because, you know, in L.A., we had the comedy store. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3890.7599999999998s)]
*  And one of the things that I realized when I moved out here, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3894.68s)]

*  They wouldn't even let them do shows in the parking lot of the comedy store. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3912.0s)]

*  It didn't make any sense. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3917.7599999999998s)]
*  And out here, we were doing full shows indoors. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3919.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing how that is. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3923.52s)]

*  And our county sheriff, you know, said, fuck you, Governor Newsom. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3937.04s)]
*  You're a hypocrite. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3941.2799999999997s)]
*  We're I'm not going to arrest people for, you know, being responsible [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3942.24s)]
*  and owning businesses and still trying to make their money and keep it afloat. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3947.56s)]
*  Well, it destroyed L.A. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3952.52s)]
*  I mean, it destroyed the restaurant industry. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3954.4399999999996s)]
*  It really did. It destroyed it. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3956.3999999999996s)]
*  Some they at one point in time, they lost somewhere around 70 percent of all restaurants. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3958.04s)]
*  It was just insane. Wow. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3962.04s)]

*  The people that run the government, their the amount of money they make [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3967.3199999999997s)]
*  is not dependent on whether or not businesses stay open. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3971.04s)]
*  If it was, they would have never shut Jack shit down. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3974.0s)]
*  If the if the if they worked it like, say, if you work for a company [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3977.16s)]
*  and you're a CEO and the company makes a profit, you get bonuses. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3982.52s)]
*  You get bonuses based on the amount of profit the company gets. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3986.56s)]
*  If the whole state lost money and the economy crashed, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3989.2000000000003s)]
*  that should be reflected in your paycheck. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=3994.36s)]

*  And if that was the case, you would have seen a completely different response. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4001.04s)]
*  They would have been like, ladies and gentlemen, you just need to get vitamin D [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4005.04s)]
*  and everybody needs to start drinking water and exercising and losing weight. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4007.8s)]
*  And here's some ways to boost your immune system. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4011.04s)]
*  Instead of everybody has to stay indoors and all the kids have to fucking be home [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4013.6000000000004s)]
*  and mask up. And it's just nuts. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4017.84s)]
*  It's just nuts to watch it all work. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4021.6000000000004s)]
*  And so many people stepped in line and so many people like, OK. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4023.7200000000003s)]
*  And nobody got angry about it. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4027.48s)]
*  I was one month in. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4029.48s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck is going on? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4031.76s)]
*  I started looking in May of 2020 [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4033.7200000000003s)]
*  because I was like, these motherfuckers are never going to let this go. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4036.88s)]
*  They're never going to let this go. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4039.7200000000003s)]
*  They keep ramping up all the new regulations and ramping up what can be closed. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4041.1600000000003s)]
*  They shut out outdoor dining, which made no fucking sense. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4045.92s)]
*  None of it made any sense. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4049.76s)]
*  And that's when I started moving. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4051.04s)]
*  When I came out here, first thing we did with my family, we went to a restaurant. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4052.2400000000002s)]
*  We sat indoors and my kids were like, we can eat at a restaurant. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4056.76s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4060.08s)]
*  And we went on a lake on Lake Austin. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4061.4s)]
*  We were looking at this house and we went on a boat on the lake. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4064.88s)]
*  And there was people jumping in the water and drinking and playing music. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4067.88s)]
*  And my kids were like, I want to live here. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4072.2400000000002s)]
*  So then it was just talking my wife into it. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4074.08s)]
*  It's like, come on. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4075.84s)]
*  Like, listen, we could just if we don't like it, we could always move back. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4076.92s)]
*  Where was she from from L.A. area? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4080.28s)]
*  Well, we lived we both lived in L.A. for 20 plus years. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4081.84s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's like had all these friends there. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4084.48s)]
*  I had all my my business was there. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4087.0s)]
*  Everything was there. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4088.88s)]
*  You know, comedy was there. Everything was there. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4090.36s)]
*  But I just didn't like I don't like people telling me what to do, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4092.44s)]
*  especially people that are hypocrites. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4096.04s)]
*  And those photos of Newsome came out when he was dining indoors with no mask on. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4098.12s)]
*  And it's like these fucking and these kids were still going to school. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4102.52s)]
*  And private school. Yeah. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4105.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. All of it. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4106.879999999999s)]
*  The whole thing was fucked. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4108.639999999999s)]
*  It was just the whole thing is fucked. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4110.08s)]
*  You're just allowing these people that I never thought about who the governor was before. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4112.0s)]
*  I never thought about who the mayor was. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4117.16s)]
*  It didn't ever really cared. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4118.919999999999s)]
*  I didn't care. I did what I had to do. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4120.599999999999s)]
*  And hopefully they did a good job and fucked the economy up. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4122.4s)]
*  Now we need Joe Rogan in there. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4125.48s)]
*  Fuck that. You don't want me. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4126.959999999999s)]
*  You don't want me in there. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4129.599999999999s)]
*  I would rather have you than. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4131.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, you probably would. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4133.4s)]
*  You probably want to have me in there, but they'd probably assassinate me. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4134.64s)]
*  It wouldn't take long before I'd be like, hey, why are we spending money on all these things? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4137.68s)]
*  Fuck out of here with this. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4141.8s)]
*  How many people are working on the homeless committee? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4144.400000000001s)]
*  Get out of here. We we looked into that. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4147.160000000001s)]
*  The homeless thing is nuts. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4149.6s)]
*  There's people on this whatever governing body that's supposed to be handling the homeless crisis. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4151.160000000001s)]
*  There's people on that that are making two hundred forty thousand dollars a year. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4156.88s)]
*  They have zero incentive to get rid of the homeless problem, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4160.280000000001s)]
*  because then they don't have a job. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4163.32s)]
*  Like, what are you going to do? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4164.96s)]
*  You're going to transfer over to somewhere else and make the same amount of money. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4165.72s)]
*  You got to think and probably because she just that money to actually help homeless out. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4169.28s)]
*  I don't know how the fuck they do it. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4174.84s)]
*  They've ruined it. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4176.56s)]
*  They've got it's gotten so bad that I just don't know how you pull the how you turn it around. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4177.52s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of homeless, a lot of it is a lot stems from getting mixed up with drug use. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4182.72s)]
*  Being dependent. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4190.2s)]
*  Drug use and mental illness. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4192.2s)]
*  That's the primary cause of most of it. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4193.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, they try to make it seem as if it's just like people down on their luck like, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4195.76s)]
*  yeah, maybe there's a few probably should have finished that wall. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4199.4s)]
*  Would have helped. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4203.72s)]
*  That's the craziest thing is that two things are happening simultaneously. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4205.28s)]
*  The southern border wide open and people are pushing for people to be able to vote with no ID. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4209.599999999999s)]
*  Those two things are insane. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4215.84s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4217.36s)]
*  Did you see that they're sending people back from Venezuela? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4218.4s)]
*  Because Venezuela has a communist government and the people that come over to here, they escape socialism. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4222.5199999999995s)]
*  And those people are most likely to vote like Cubans do in America. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4227.72s)]
*  Cubans in America vote Republican. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4231.08s)]
*  And so when they're having these issues, they're trying to like actively send Venezuelans back to Venezuela. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4233.28s)]
*  Of course they are. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4238.8s)]
*  So transparent. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4240.76s)]
*  It's so transparent. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4242.4s)]
*  I don't care what their other excuses are. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4243.44s)]
*  The fact that they're targeting Venezuelans and that Venezuelans 100 percent hate socialism, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4245.44s)]
*  the ones that come over here, it's nuts. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4250.76s)]
*  I mean, look, there's always these periods in history where things get bad and then they get better again. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4254.280000000001s)]
*  They get bad and they get better again. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4259.92s)]
*  I mean, things were great for a long time, but they are on a slide and we got to pull out of that fucking slide. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4261.52s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4267.72s)]
*  And if we don't, it's not good. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4268.84s)]
*  I'm real nervous about next year. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4271.040000000001s)]
*  Real nervous no matter who wins. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4274.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4275.84s)]
*  The country is going to be in a frothy uproar because of this fucked up media that we have. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4276.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4280.759999999999s)]
*  No, I think they're the biggest problem that we have. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4281.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4283.719999999999s)]
*  No, they are. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4284.4s)]
*  They're the enemy of peace. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4285.16s)]
*  On both sides, not just. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4286.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4288.08s)]
*  Well, their business is just get people riled up, get people paying attention. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4289.5599999999995s)]
*  And the most outrageous shit that they can say, the most outrageous stories they can publish, those are the ones that are going to get clicks. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4293.32s)]
*  So those are the ones they publish. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4299.04s)]
*  And then everybody gets into this frothy panic. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4301.08s)]
*  And meanwhile. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4303.36s)]
*  It's amazing the spin that they could put on, you know, if if both sides were airing the same exact story, it sounds like two completely different things. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4304.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4314.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4314.679999999999s)]

*  There's not one thing where you go, oh, this is the bubba bub news. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4320.799999999999s)]
*  They're always legit above board. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4324.24s)]
*  It's a complicated issue and they're going to lay out all the different sides to it. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4326.08s)]
*  No, everything's got to spin to it. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4329.04s)]
*  So good. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4333.24s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4334.4s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4336.2s)]
*  I don't know how it gets better. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4336.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't either. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4338.0s)]
*  It just sucks that you have to think about it. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4341.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, most of my life, I didn't really think about it that much. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4343.719999999999s)]
*  I never did. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4347.32s)]
*  I always worried about wrestling and yeah, then fighting and then, you know, simpler things. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4348.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4355.599999999999s)]
*  Getting shit getting better at what I did. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4356.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4359.36s)]
*  And I would never, never go into politics. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4359.96s)]
*  So it didn't matter to me. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4362.84s)]
*  You know, I never really cared. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4365.4800000000005s)]
*  Like just like what you said, I was the same way and didn't really pay attention to much of it until recently. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4367.360000000001s)]
*  I talked to Dana White once. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4374.0s)]
*  I said, you should run for president. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4375.2s)]
*  And he's like, dude, the skeletons that would come out of my closet, it would feel like the walking dead. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4377.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely true. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4383.2s)]
*  Of course. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4384.84s)]
*  Of course. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4386.24s)]
*  Of course. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4387.56s)]
*  I mean, that's, they don't give a shit if you'd be good at your job. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4388.280000000001s)]
*  They just give a shit about getting their side in. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4392.320000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4395.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4396.0s)]
*  And this country is so polarized. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4396.56s)]
*  The whole right versus left thing is so crazy. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4398.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like racism is a lot worse than it was before all this. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4403.72s)]
*  Just because they talk about it all the time. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4409.6s)]
*  They're talking about it too. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4412.08s)]
*  And when it's not even there, they're still talking about it. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4413.24s)]
*  They're making an issue when it's not even there. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4416.84s)]
*  And they're stirring the pot. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4417.92s)]
*  Yeah, because that's what their job is. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4420.0s)]
*  Their job is just to get people outraged. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4421.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, if your business is just to get people fired up and paying attention to things and angry, that's what they do. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4423.320000000001s)]
*  It's just our job to kind of like figure that out now. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4430.0s)]
*  And I think trust in mainstream media is at an all time low. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4432.52s)]
*  I don't think there's ever been a time in my life where people trust the mainstream news less. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4436.08s)]
*  Well, I know that I don't trust them, but I don't know how even I don't know. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4440.8s)]
*  But no one's watching them. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4445.84s)]
*  CNN got its lowest ratings since the 1990s the other day. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4447.320000000001s)]
*  They have 43,000 people watching. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4450.92s)]
*  You know how crazy that is? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4453.68s)]
*  And that's 43,000 people worldwide or just in the States? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4455.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4458.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4459.88s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4460.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4462.240000000001s)]
*  But even if it's just in the States, that's nuts. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4462.76s)]
*  That's nothing. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4465.56s)]
*  Especially when they do it in the States. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4466.280000000001s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4468.0s)]
*  That's nothing. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4469.2s)]
*  Especially when they do the points on how many millions. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4469.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4474.56s)]
*  I mean, that's literally a Taylor Swift concert. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4474.88s)]
*  And not even a big one. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4480.76s)]
*  That's one of her smaller concerts. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4482.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4483.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4484.360000000001s)]
*  But I would like to see the UFC in an arena. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4485.84s)]
*  I think the UFC could do that. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4490.04s)]
*  An outdoor arena? [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4491.52s)]
*  Yeah, that Raiders arena. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4492.32s)]
*  I think they could do that arena. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4494.16s)]
*  Like what? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4495.4800000000005s)]
*  Pride? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4496.24s)]
*  Then K-1 did back in the Tokyo Dome. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4497.0s)]
*  No, it was in the Saitama Super Arena. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4499.68s)]
*  No, no, that's enclosed. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4501.76s)]
*  Oh, is it enclosed? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4503.84s)]
*  I think, yeah, it just stretches. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4504.76s)]
*  They had a big arena. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4506.64s)]
*  I didn't go to it, but they had like 80 some thousand people there at that. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4508.240000000001s)]
*  I think it was a New Year's Eve show. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4513.04s)]
*  The only problem with that is you have to hope it doesn't rain. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4514.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4516.92s)]
*  And I think they had people skydive in. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4518.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, look, obsessed with Las Vegas fear. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4520.4400000000005s)]

*  I haven't been in there yet. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4528.2s)]
*  Have you been in there? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4529.320000000001s)]
*  No, I haven't. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4530.16s)]
*  I've seen it in videos and stuff. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4531.28s)]
*  It looks insane. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4533.4400000000005s)]
*  When you're inside of it, the entire thing is a screen, like everything, the [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4534.6s)]
*  ceiling, all the wall. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4538.68s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4539.8s)]

*  No, I haven't. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4541.24s)]
*  It's fucking bananas. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4542.04s)]
*  Like a concert. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4543.72s)]
*  I've heard that it's crazy. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4544.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4545.92s)]

*  Crazy good. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4547.28s)]
*  For concerts. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4547.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4548.320000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4548.72s)]
*  How many is this seat, Jamie? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4549.52s)]
*  18? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4551.92s)]
*  Oh, that'd be perfect for a UFC. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4553.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4554.8s)]
*  And then you could show the replays on the ceiling. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4556.2s)]
*  You can show the replays everywhere. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4558.6s)]
*  So the guy knocked out could see it too. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4560.28s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4562.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4562.6s)]
*  As he's on his back, you see the head kick land. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4563.04s)]
*  When you look at the level of fighting today and think about how it was when you [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4566.8s)]
*  started, are you proud? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4572.96s)]
*  Are you proud that you were part of it in the beginning? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4575.16s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm definitely proud that I was part of that journey. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4577.400000000001s)]
*  But I mean, I don't know. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4580.92s)]
*  I still feel like there's certain things missing on some of these guys. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4584.2s)]
*  You know, they're just not great at certain, at any one thing, some of them. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4591.24s)]
*  But they're really good at everything, but not spectacular. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4597.64s)]
*  Not specialists. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4601.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4602.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4602.84s)]
*  We have a few guys that are specialists like Paheta. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4603.4s)]
*  You know, there's a few of the elite kickboxers. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4606.6s)]
*  But then you see more, you know, you see where the holes are in their game too. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4608.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4613.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4615.04s)]
*  But yeah, I think it's definitely evolved into, you know, some guys that are [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4615.32s)]
*  extremely, a lot more skilled and talented than back in the day for sure. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4622.879999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4627.48s)]
*  I just think, maybe I think what's missing is some of the, just the old school attitude. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4629.28s)]
*  Well, the old school guys did it because they wanted to do it and there wasn't [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4634.679999999999s)]
*  really much money in it at all. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4638.28s)]
*  You had to be really kind of crazy. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4639.84s)]
*  You know? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4642.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4643.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, you had to be a wild motherfucker to enter into UFC one or UFC two or UFC three. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4644.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it was just, you had to be fucking crazy. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4650.719999999999s)]
*  It was funny. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4653.48s)]
*  I, I, I came home from the 92 Olympics and I was in my hometown in Victorville, which [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4654.12s)]
*  is in the middle of nowhere, and I went out to the local bar and some guy was in there [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4662.4s)]
*  talking to me about, Hey, you know, we're getting ready to put on this show. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4667.6s)]
*  You know, we're going to see who the toughest, toughest guys are, you know, from, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4672.160000000001s)]
*  we're going to have a wrestler, boxers, and, and, and he's describing the UFC. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4677.400000000001s)]
*  And it happened about three months after that. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4683.240000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, we're putting together the show. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4685.72s)]
*  We're about to do it, you know, blah, blah, blah. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4687.52s)]
*  And next thing I know, the UFC started. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4689.4400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4692.280000000001s)]
*  I have no idea who that guy was. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4693.320000000001s)]
*  Just some guy you met at a bar. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4695.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4696.96s)]
*  I wonder who it was. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4697.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4698.56s)]
*  I wonder what his gig was, what, what, what role he had in it. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4699.160000000001s)]
*  I found out about it from a local video store. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4703.72s)]
*  I think someone had told me about it. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4707.72s)]
*  And then I rented UFC too. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4709.72s)]
*  It was 94 and I just moved to LA and I remember watching it and going, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4712.08s)]
*  Holy shit, they did it. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4716.72s)]
*  Because I always remembered thinking when I was back when I was kickboxing [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4719.360000000001s)]
*  and Taekwondo, like everybody always wondered what would happen if a judo [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4722.88s)]
*  guy fought a wrestler would have another boxer fought a karate guy. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4726.76s)]
*  But to see it all actually happen, like, holy shit, this is nuts. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4731.04s)]
*  And that was back when, you know, hoist Gracie, it was just kind of getting started. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4735.96s)]
*  And then Jiu-Jitsu was everywhere. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4741.72s)]
*  Just Jiu-Jitsu schools just popped up everywhere. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4743.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4746.2s)]
*  And it was just like a complete revolution of martial arts where [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4746.84s)]
*  there had never been anything like that before. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4751.4400000000005s)]
*  There was, there was a John Paredi thing. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4753.839999999999s)]
*  Was it world extreme fighting? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4756.5199999999995s)]
*  Remember he had that, he had that event. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4758.48s)]
*  With John Lewis, right? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4761.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4762.96s)]
*  Yep. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4763.44s)]
*  John Lewis and that was, um, Mario Sperry was in that. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4764.719999999999s)]
*  Maury Smith, Conan Silvera. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4768.96s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of like good fighters that came out of that as well. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4771.679999999999s)]
*  And there's a few of these organizations that were emerging. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4774.599999999999s)]
*  And then in Japan, there was rings and K-1 and, you know, and then Pride emerged. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4777.2s)]
*  And at one point in time, Pride was bigger than, than the UFC. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4784.12s)]
*  It was fucking huge. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4787.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4789.84s)]
*  I think they just hit them and K-1 got in a pissing match with, you know, with [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4790.4800000000005s)]
*  something and they really kind of crippled each other. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4796.56s)]
*  I can't imagine how they did it. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4800.88s)]
*  It was so big in Japan. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4802.96s)]
*  I can't imagine that it fell off as much of it did because it was so much [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4805.12s)]
*  bigger in Japan than the UFC ever was. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4808.84s)]
*  And I think they, they had a bigger audience, uh, internationally also, not [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4812.08s)]
*  in the States than the UFC, but internationally, like in Europe and, and [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4817.84s)]
*  cause they would really get a lot of European fighters and Brazilians. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4823.08s)]
*  It was a hardcore, there was a hardcore base in America that watched it. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4827.96s)]
*  I remember guys from a jujitsu school, like when they would air it live, they'd [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4831.68s)]
*  come over my house at like three o'clock in the morning to watch it. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4835.72s)]
*  I forget when it would air. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4838.4400000000005s)]
*  Or sometimes it would air, like you would have to like stay offline and not [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4840.04s)]
*  find the results for like a while and then try to watch it. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4844.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4847.200000000001s)]
*  And they delayed it. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4847.400000000001s)]
*  But, but those events seem so insane. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4848.96s)]
*  Those events seem so incredible. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4853.04s)]
*  What was the biggest crowd that you've fought in front of over there? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4854.88s)]
*  I think, I don't know, 65, 70, somewhere in that range at Tokyo Dome, like it [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4857.679999999999s)]
*  was sold out for New Year's Eve. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4864.5199999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4866.16s)]
*  I don't even remember who I. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4868.08s)]
*  What is that like? [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4869.24s)]
*  I don't know any other day, but it was definitely a lot more energy. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4872.92s)]
*  What I liked was, you know, as a fighter, they, they did like their opening [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4877.599999999999s)]
*  ceremony was pretty, pretty cool to me. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4883.36s)]
*  And, you know, you get up there and they do a big show and then they [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4886.400000000001s)]
*  introduce all the fighters. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4892.360000000001s)]
*  I think, I think that was pretty cool, a way to do it. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4893.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's just part of their culture too, you know, putting the, those athletes. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4896.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4901.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4903.0s)]
*  So I do miss that as well as other things with the show, but they, they put on, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4903.72s)]
*  and this is what I always say, everybody used to say, Oh, it's better, you know, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4909.6s)]
*  it's better fighters that you'll see or pride, you know, I'm like, I don't know. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4913.88s)]
*  I think, I think they both have great fighters and they're probably pretty [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4916.88s)]
*  comparable, but there's no comparison to the show they put on pride just was a [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4921.36s)]
*  show in addition to the fights. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4926.8s)]
*  And also the walk-in, like the walkout was giant. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4929.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4934.04s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4934.24s)]
*  Pyrotechnics and fucking giant screens. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4934.76s)]
*  And it was, I mean, it was an event. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4937.76s)]
*  It was, it was unbelievable. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4941.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4942.64s)]
*  And I put certain fighters in that era up against anybody. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4943.12s)]
*  I mean, I think, I think Crow Cop and his prime over there is one of [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4946.92s)]
*  the scariest heavyweights ever. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4951.5199999999995s)]
*  Fador in his prime over there without a doubt, if not the best heavyweight of [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4952.72s)]
*  all time, definitely there's like, it's a, there's an argument between [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4958.44s)]
*  him and a couple other guys. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4961.599999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4963.28s)]
*  You know, there was so many great fights over there. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4965.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4967.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4968.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4970.679999999999s)]
*  There was quite a few. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4970.92s)]
*  And, you know, when, when they started trying to do it, you know, kind of [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4973.32s)]
*  work with the UFC a little bit, UFC would send in some of their guys over [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4978.4s)]
*  Chuck and, and Rampage would get over there, even though Rampage had fought [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4981.96s)]
*  there before, you know, but, and I think that, that 10 minute first round [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4987.0s)]
*  really hurt some of those guys. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4994.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4996.679999999999s)]
*  It was different. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4997.0s)]
*  They sent Chuck over there. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4997.84s)]
*  I remember he KO'd Alistair at a two oh five. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=4998.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5002.56s)]
*  That was been Alistair was skinny. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5003.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5005.64s)]
*  And he had a, he fought with, uh, what's his name? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5005.88s)]
*  Uh, he's from Dallas, I think from, uh, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5009.96s)]
*  Chai Metzger. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5014.320000000001s)]
*  Chai Metzger. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5015.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5015.8s)]
*  Uh, and I think Guy was beating him, knocked him down and then, you know, I [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5017.2s)]
*  don't know what happened, but he got caught. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5022.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5024.400000000001s)]
*  Chuck caught him. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5024.8s)]
*  Chuck could bang. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5025.56s)]
*  Chuck had crazy chin too. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5026.679999999999s)]
*  He is, his ability to absorb shots was nuts. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5028.599999999999s)]
*  He was willing to, and obviously that cost him in the long run. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5032.04s)]
*  But he had an iron chin. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5035.92s)]
*  He would just bite down on his mouthpiece and just eat shots. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5037.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5040.839999999999s)]
*  You try not to be known for that. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5041.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5043.0s)]
*  It never really turns out well in the long run. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5043.719999999999s)]
*  Almost every guy that winds up, you know, that has that sort of style [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5046.32s)]
*  eventually winds up getting KO'd. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5051.2s)]
*  Eventually the foundation just falls apart. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5053.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5056.16s)]
*  Doesn't take much sometimes and you hit and you get it in the right spot. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5058.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5062.24s)]
*  Well, you know, do you, do you have KOs that are like some of your most, like [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5063.44s)]
*  the Hector Lombard one I was just watching out the other night, that one was nuts. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5068.719999999999s)]
*  Cause we never saw you throw a head kick before. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5072.12s)]
*  I threw, um, three head kicks or high kicks. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5074.599999999999s)]
*  I don't, they weren't close to the head because I just wasn't that flexible [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5079.44s)]
*  against, uh, uh, rich Franklin in England, but I, I fell to my ass every time I [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5083.04s)]
*  slipped. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5089.5199999999995s)]
*  So I had thrown them before, but, and I'd throw them in practice, but against [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5091.5199999999995s)]
*  lefties, I kind of had this thing where I kind of changed levels. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5094.84s)]
*  Like I'm going to kind of look at your legs and, and my head kick comes up there [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5098.56s)]
*  and he's short, so I was able to land it. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5105.2s)]
*  That's a guy that I think people miss his prime too. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5108.76s)]
*  Cause his prime was in Bellator. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5112.5599999999995s)]
*  He was fucking starching people in Bellator. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5114.599999999999s)]
*  Hector Lombard in Bellator was a fucking terror. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5117.76s)]
*  He was a terror. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5120.679999999999s)]
*  He was so athletic and he was so fast and powerful and that judo background, you [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5122.32s)]
*  know, I remember, uh, when he came to the UFC, he had a few fights like that. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5127.84s)]
*  Like the Nate Marquardt fight was a good example of that, where he saw like that [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5132.28s)]
*  same sort of Hector Lombard. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5135.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5138.08s)]
*  He comes in fast and strong and then, you know, you got to weather the storm a [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5138.36s)]
*  little bit. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5144.36s)]
*  Well, you caught him with the head kick. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5145.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think if I remember correctly, you hit him with a back fist. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5147.0s)]
*  Uh, back elbow, back elbow. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5150.92s)]
*  And then you elbow them on the ground. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5153.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5155.44s)]
*  That was the elbow on the ground. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5156.0s)]
*  When he first came here from, um, Australia, is he, he was Cuban, but he went to [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5157.6s)]
*  Australia and lived there. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5164.4s)]
*  And when he first came to the States, he came to my gym first for about three [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5166.28s)]
*  months and, uh, nobody liked him. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5171.76s)]
*  He was a big bully, just trying to knock people out, warming up or, you know, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5175.2s)]
*  just when you're supposed to be going easy, just trying to hurt people. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5180.0s)]
*  And it would happen every time I'd be out of town. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5184.76s)]
*  I'd come back. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5187.76s)]
*  I'd hear about it. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5188.88s)]
*  And so could you, it was in there too. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5190.72s)]
*  And he fucking put them in his place once. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5192.36s)]
*  But so when I went to fight Hector, you know, the media is like, asked me, you [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5194.44s)]
*  know, Hector saying how he never, he left your gym cause he never felt welcome. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5199.879999999999s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5204.4s)]
*  I'm like, well, I never had a problem with him, but everyone in my gym [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5204.839999999999s)]
*  thought he was a big bully. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5208.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5211.16s)]
*  And that's all I said about it. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5211.36s)]
*  And we're in the face off like week of the fight. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5212.919999999999s)]
*  And he asked me, who, who says I'm a, who says I'm a bully? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5218.679999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, what did you say? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5223.639999999999s)]
*  And yeah, who, who says I'm a bully? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5226.48s)]
*  And I'm like, everybody, everybody said you're a bully. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5228.639999999999s)]
*  Am I, well, who, everybody at my gym, not me, but everybody at my gym. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5232.32s)]
*  And he just couldn't get over that. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5239.639999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, you motherfucker, this isn't the time or place for that. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5240.879999999999s)]
*  I'm going to fuck you up. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5244.0s)]
*  So that those last couple of elbows were a little more personal. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5245.919999999999s)]
*  It's probably the only fight I've ever really felt that way that I really [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5250.48s)]
*  wanted to fuck that guy up. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5253.599999999999s)]
*  Not the bisming fight. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5255.2s)]
*  No, I just, I, it was just a fight to me and I didn't like him, but it wasn't a [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5256.76s)]
*  guy that I'd hang out with, but you know, he, he was just him and I knew that I [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5262.4s)]
*  would beat him, but that logo that you have the flying punch, that is the ultimate [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5266.4s)]
*  fuck you, that logo is so wild that you put that as your logo, but I don't even [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5272.36s)]
*  know why he's upset about that. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5278.4s)]
*  Cause he's not even in it. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5280.2s)]
*  Yeah, but it's, you know, he knows what it is. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5284.36s)]
*  Everybody knows what it is. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5287.92s)]
*  It's not like a chalk line on the ground underneath him. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5288.88s)]
*  I remember when I saw it, when I saw that logo for the first time, I went, oh shit. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5291.4s)]
*  Because that, I mean, you flattened him with that right hand. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5297.48s)]
*  I mean, he was out cold and then you launched yourself through the air and [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5301.28s)]
*  smashed him with that right hand. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5305.5599999999995s)]
*  And it was that, but that becoming your logo was one of the wildest things. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5307.76s)]
*  I mean, that is, that's a crazy logo. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5315.44s)]
*  I mean, everyone has to know what that is because otherwise it wouldn't even [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5317.36s)]
*  make sense. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5320.92s)]
*  Like, what is he doing? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5321.64s)]
*  Is he about to do a cartwheel? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5323.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5325.32s)]
*  It's not like, you know, you're throwing a head kick or you're throwing a punch. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5326.32s)]
*  It's like you're flying and your arm is above you like this. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5330.0s)]
*  Well, what about Air Jordan's logo? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5333.48s)]
*  There's no basket there. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5335.76s)]
*  That's true, but no one winds up with a massive concussion after that. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5337.04s)]
*  You know, it's a great logo though. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5341.8s)]
*  It really is. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5344.48s)]
*  Somebody had Photoshopped him on like some shoes. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5346.08s)]
*  I think I posted that not too long ago. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5349.64s)]
*  Oh, Photoshopped him out. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5351.92s)]
*  No, that logo. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5353.28s)]
*  Oh, like Michael Jordan. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5354.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5356.72s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5357.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5359.28s)]
*  There's a lot of guys that make custom sneakers. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5359.48s)]
*  They should make you a pair of those. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5361.28s)]
*  Why not? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5365.12s)]
*  I don't wear shoes that often. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5365.88s)]
*  So how often are you still training with guys? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5367.280000000001s)]
*  You still work out with guys? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5371.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5373.320000000001s)]
*  I'm getting chubby, so I need to start working out. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5373.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5376.12s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5381.76s)]
*  I just say everything. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5382.320000000001s)]
*  I like to cook. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5383.160000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty good at it. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5384.68s)]
*  So I just need to start working out a little more. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5385.84s)]
*  I'm not too bad, but for not doing shit. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5388.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, I might've worked out once in the last six months. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5391.52s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5394.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5395.0s)]
*  No, that's not good. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5395.24s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5396.4s)]
*  The least I've ever worked out in my whole life. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5397.6s)]
*  Just, I don't know, maybe having to do it for so long. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5399.72s)]
*  Well, that does happen to a lot of fighters. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5402.84s)]
*  You know, they get fat after they're done fighting. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5405.08s)]
*  They're just like, fuck all the weight cutting, all the bullshit. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5407.0s)]
*  You just get so tired of it. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5409.6s)]
*  You just want to enjoy your life now. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5410.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5412.88s)]
*  And I don't know. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5413.44s)]
*  I just, I don't know, maybe I'm just got lazy or something. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5415.48s)]
*  It's not about, I don't know why. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5419.04s)]
*  You still look good. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5421.2s)]
*  I'm at my gym almost every day and coach, you know, I coach and stuff, but I feel [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5421.84s)]
*  like I'm still capable of doing a lot of things. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5426.84s)]
*  The last time I have worked out, you know, it always goes well. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5429.2s)]
*  Are you thinking about just, just training a little bit now? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5433.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5436.280000000001s)]
*  More grappling stuff, trying not to do the sparring part as much, even though [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5437.320000000001s)]
*  I'd probably get antsy wanting to spar just for fun, but. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5443.16s)]
*  I'm sure you would. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5447.400000000001s)]
*  When you were training, what did you do for recovery? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5448.76s)]
*  Like were you, like guys today, they've got massage therapists and saunas and [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5451.88s)]
*  cold plunges and all that jazz. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5457.72s)]
*  Did you, did you have like a sophisticated way to recover when you were training? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5459.24s)]
*  Yeah, I would try to sauna, you know, and I do get, I would get during training camp [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5464.68s)]
*  a massage probably twice a week for, and they were about three hours long each time. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5471.8s)]
*  You remember my, my masseuse, Mariah. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5477.68s)]
*  I do remember her because she told me that working with you was like working with wood. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5480.080000000001s)]
*  She said you were so dense. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5484.280000000001s)]
*  She said she'd never massage anybody who's so dense. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5485.96s)]
*  She said it was crazy. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5488.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5490.200000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, so I'm, she actually owns a business that's in my building where my gym is. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5491.52s)]
*  It's called the lab, but they do like, like, uh, IV therapy and hormone replacement [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5496.72s)]
*  also, and, and peptides and all sorts of different. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5505.4s)]
*  Are you doing all that stuff? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5509.36s)]
*  Uh, I do some peptides and I do, uh, yeah, I still, I do the hormone replacement as well. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5510.599999999999s)]
*  I work with another company, like an online one too, blokes. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5516.759999999999s)]
*  It's pretty good for, it's virtual. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5520.92s)]
*  So it's super easy to, for me to, I just, I don't even have to go anywhere [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5523.719999999999s)]
*  and just do it all myself, but they got some pretty good peptides. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5528.4s)]
*  Guys are doing that now. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5531.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5532.24s)]
*  Cause you know, peptides are a thing that that was one of the sticking points with USADA. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5533.160000000001s)]
*  They were stopping guys from using BPC one five seven. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5537.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5539.8s)]
*  And they, they allowed it for a while and then they stopped using it. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5540.160000000001s)]
*  Like, come on guys, all this is doing is helping people recover. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5543.040000000001s)]
*  That's all it's doing is helping people recover from injuries. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5546.160000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5548.56s)]
*  For injuries, not necessarily. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5549.120000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5550.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5551.360000000001s)]
*  They got a new one. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5552.360000000001s)]
*  That's pretty good too. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5553.400000000001s)]
*  I forgot what it's called something 5,000 or something. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5555.280000000001s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5558.4400000000005s)]
*  I forgot what it's called, but yeah, it's, it's for injuries as well. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5559.280000000001s)]
*  But you, but you know, the FDA is trying to stop people from taking that, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5562.28s)]
*  which doesn't make any fucking sense. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5567.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5569.12s)]
*  When they're not stopping people from taking opiates. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5569.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5572.04s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5572.4s)]
*  So yeah, she, she's doing, doing that, but yeah, I would do massage therapy for [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5574.84s)]
*  recovery and sometimes, sometimes an ice bath, I'd ice things down, depends on [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5579.44s)]
*  what I'm, what's hurting, but, and supplements and eating good during training camp. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5588.16s)]
*  But no stretching. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5593.44s)]
*  Uh, I would get stretched like after the massages. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5595.5199999999995s)]
*  I just couldn't imagine how inflexible you are and how powerful you were. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5599.04s)]
*  It was just nuts to see you move it around, try to touch your toes. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5604.599999999999s)]
*  I feel like because I'm not very flexible, it kept me from getting in, in [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5608.84s)]
*  bad submission positions sometimes. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5614.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5617.36s)]
*  They couldn't move you. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5619.0s)]
*  I've heard guys say that, that being inflexible gives them more power. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5623.88s)]
*  And like, I don't know. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5627.5199999999995s)]
*  Was that, I don't know. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5628.64s)]
*  I mean, when I was high school kid, I was pretty flexible and just slowly over [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5629.48s)]
*  time, I just petrified, I guess. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5634.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5637.96s)]
*  Well, you got dense, you know, my dad was the same way, just the same body type. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5638.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5643.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5643.92s)]
*  So it was just genetics, you think? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5644.4s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5645.72s)]
*  My sister's that way too. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5646.92s)]
*  Do you ever wonder like what it would have been like if you started today? [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5648.76s)]
*  Like how much further you would have progressed? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5652.280000000001s)]
*  I would have probably made more money. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5655.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5657.200000000001s)]
*  What's the most you ever made in a, in one fight? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5658.280000000001s)]
*  Um, well, the most I've ever should have made in one fight would have been when I [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5660.72s)]
*  fought Bisming because I had pay-per-view in my deal and, uh, the, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5666.4800000000005s)]
*  the second Bisming fight? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5675.679999999999s)]
*  No, the first one. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5677.0s)]
*  The first one. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5678.32s)]
*  And I, when we coached on Ultimate Fighter, we were going to be main or co-main. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5679.4s)]
*  I think, I think, uh, GSP fought that night and then, uh, Frank Meir and, and, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5684.04s)]
*  and Brock Lesnar were supposed to fight at a different event and somebody got [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5691.839999999999s)]
*  hurt and they pushed them to that event. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5695.5599999999995s)]
*  So Dana bumped me down to the third spot and promoted it still as a co-main, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5697.759999999999s)]
*  but didn't pay me pay-per-view. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5703.84s)]
*  So it would have been like three or three and a half million for that one. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5709.64s)]
*  What did it want? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5713.400000000001s)]
*  Just pay-per-view. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5713.92s)]
*  Uh, couple like 300 grand. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5715.6s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5718.64s)]
*  But the most I've ever made, I think is probably around a million. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5721.2s)]
*  Do you remember what the fight that was? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5726.72s)]
*  Well, there was a whole contract of that, like six fights, I think. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5728.24s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5733.5199999999995s)]
*  Plus certain pay-per-views, depending on the event. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5734.8s)]
*  That one's got to suck. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5740.4s)]
*  That one's got to sting the 3 million one. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5741.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5743.88s)]
*  And you know, you'd always hear stories, not me, but about Dana, you know, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5744.44s)]
*  giving a bonus or whatever, you know, I never saw that. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5749.72s)]
*  So you never got one of those locker room bonuses? [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5754.32s)]
*  No. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5756.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, knock out of the night I got, but yeah, but not one of the big ones. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5757.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5762.36s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5763.32s)]
*  So, I mean, I didn't take it personal, but I did go to StrikeForce right after that. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5764.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5769.76s)]
*  Did you, what did you think about StrikeForce? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5770.96s)]
*  StrikeForce had some great fights. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5773.599999999999s)]
*  I thought they, I mean, I love Scott Coker. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5775.28s)]
*  He's, well, I mean, he just has the fighters in mind all the time also, not [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5778.5199999999995s)]
*  just, not just the bank account. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5786.08s)]
*  So, yeah, I feel like StrikeForce had some great fighters. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5790.12s)]
*  They, they, you know, had certain things that UFC definitely did better. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5795.36s)]
*  You know, they were a little more organized with certain things, but [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5799.84s)]
*  overall, StrikeForce was, I liked them quite a bit. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5803.08s)]
*  Well, it was definitely nice having another major organization. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5808.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5811.0s)]
*  You know, there was Elite XC that lasted a little while. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5811.84s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5814.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5815.5599999999995s)]
*  Kimbo Slice was their big guy. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5816.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5817.84s)]
*  That was pretty fun. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5818.44s)]
*  I think that was on CBS, right? [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5819.84s)]
*  Wasn't it? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5821.92s)]
*  Um, I think it was. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5823.64s)]
*  I know StrikeForce had a CBS show and then the Diaz, I fought on that [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5826.72s)]
*  card against Jake Shields and then the Diaz brothers got in a fight with Mayhem. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5833.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5838.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5839.24s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, this is not good. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5839.96s)]
*  And then the announcer said, sometimes these things happen in MMA. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5842.28s)]
*  Like, we're like, what? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5845.72s)]
*  That's the only time it's ever happened. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5847.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5851.08s)]
*  It almost happened with Johnny Walker this past weekend. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5852.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5855.4400000000005s)]
*  That was a weird one, wasn't it? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5856.12s)]
*  That was the weirdest one. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5857.320000000001s)]
*  That one didn't make any sense at all. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5858.400000000001s)]
*  They asked him where he was and apparently he said, I'm in the desert. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5859.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5863.04s)]
*  Which is a good answer. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5863.320000000001s)]
*  He's in the desert. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5864.52s)]
*  He's kind of a funny guy. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5865.88s)]
*  You know, he's kind of eccentric. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5867.04s)]
*  He's eccentric. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5869.68s)]
*  You ask him a question. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5870.96s)]
*  He seemed fine. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5872.2s)]
*  He seemed fine. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5873.8s)]
*  You know, they asked him where he was. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5874.92s)]
*  I'm in the desert. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5875.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5877.6s)]
*  Do you know what country? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5878.36s)]
*  But he also looked confused when he's standing there looking at the guy, like, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5879.12s)]
*  yeah, and not saying anything. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5884.4800000000005s)]
*  So I, but I, it was hard to hear what, what was going on. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5886.4800000000005s)]
*  Also, he doesn't speak English as a first language. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5889.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5892.32s)]
*  So there's that too. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5892.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5894.2s)]
*  You know, I thought the stoppage was. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5894.6s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5896.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5897.6s)]
*  Well, that's one of those ones where I really, I think like, why when a [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5898.32s)]
*  referee calls it off like that, why can't they restart it? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5901.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5905.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5906.76s)]
*  I don't understand that either. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5907.56s)]
*  They, they did it. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5908.84s)]
*  Uh, I think Randy might've fought on the card. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5910.4800000000005s)]
*  It was a UFC in Japan, Sakuraba, I think. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5914.52s)]
*  In Conan. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5918.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5919.32s)]
*  And he wouldn't leave and then they restarted the fight. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5920.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5923.4s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5923.84s)]
*  No, they, they fought again. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5924.2s)]
*  They fought again another time. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5925.92s)]
*  No, they've kept, they started the fight again that night. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5927.52s)]
*  Did they? [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5930.88s)]
*  I'm almost positive. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5931.52s)]
*  I think they fought again that night. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5932.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't think they fought again immediately. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5935.0s)]
*  I think. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5937.56s)]
*  No, I think it was immediate. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5937.8s)]
*  Was it? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5939.08s)]
*  I was there. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5939.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5940.16s)]
*  Why did, why do I have it in my head that they fought later in the night? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5942.2s)]
*  Cause they. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5948.24s)]
*  Later, you're saying the same night? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5948.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5950.72s)]
*  The same night. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5951.0s)]
*  Maybe they did that. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5952.84s)]
*  That's what I think they did. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5954.24s)]
*  Cause the Conan hit him with an uppercut in Sakuraba dropped down for a low [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5956.04s)]
*  angle, right. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5960.92s)]
*  And they stopped. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5961.84s)]
*  And they tried to say it was a stoppage. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5962.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, do you remember Matt Lindlin and Bustamante? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5964.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5967.72s)]
*  That was a crazy one. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5968.56s)]
*  And they restarted that one too. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5969.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5970.04s)]
*  Even though he did tap. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5970.68s)]
*  He did tap. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5971.8s)]
*  Matt Lindlin got caught in an arm bar, tapped. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5976.0s)]
*  He said, I didn't tap. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5978.32s)]
*  I might've been in the corner. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5979.28s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5980.68s)]
*  You might've been. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5981.88s)]
*  And then they started and then they went a whole nother round. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5982.76s)]
*  And then the round after that, he caught him in a guillotine. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5985.8s)]
*  So Bustamante tapped him twice. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5988.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5990.56s)]
*  That was nuts. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5991.28s)]
*  But that was, you know, I mean, I would like them to look at replays and say, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5992.52s)]
*  Oh, that's a tap. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5998.4800000000005s)]
*  And that makes sense. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=5999.24s)]
*  But in that case of the one this weekend with Ankaleyev and started up again, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6000.12s)]
*  they're both fine. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6005.88s)]
*  Everybody wants to see the fight. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6006.56s)]
*  What's the formality? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6007.8s)]
*  Like, what's the point? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6008.92s)]
*  There was, yeah. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6010.0s)]
*  Didn't make any sense. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6010.88s)]
*  Because he didn't understand what I asked him. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6012.2s)]
*  To it's also like check his eyes. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6015.4s)]
*  Like also when someone gets hit with an illegal shot, don't they have a certain [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6017.96s)]
*  amount of time to recover? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6021.48s)]
*  Like why? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6023.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6023.839999999999s)]
*  So why is the doctor in there immediately anyway? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6024.16s)]
*  And I didn't, they called it a no contest, but it was questionable if, because it [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6027.4s)]
*  was kind of a, it was definitely illegal. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6033.959999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6036.919999999999s)]
*  Which means disqualification, which means disqualification, but he called it an [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6037.879999999999s)]
*  unintentional, but he intended. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6042.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6044.959999999999s)]
*  So I didn't understand that. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6045.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6047.04s)]
*  So, but yeah, I don't know if it may be, and I don't know Johnny Walker, but I [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6048.28s)]
*  didn't know if he was kind of playing it off, like I'm going to get the win. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6054.96s)]
*  If I don't. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6059.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6061.4s)]
*  That's why he looked like he was confused at the question. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6062.5199999999995s)]
*  That was, that was curious to me as to why he was just, you know, looking at him. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6065.639999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't know how well the doctor spoke English either. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6070.679999999999s)]
*  Was the doctor an English language speaking guy? [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6074.5199999999995s)]
*  And Johnny isn't Johnny can speak a little bit of English, but when I've interviewed [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6079.36s)]
*  him, he's, you know, he speaks Portuguese. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6083.4s)]
*  So when you talk to him in English, he has to really pay attention and something [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6086.04s)]
*  wrong with that answer in the desert. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6091.24s)]
*  It's true. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6092.96s)]
*  Where are you? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6093.4s)]
*  I'm in the desert. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6094.28s)]
*  He's in the desert. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6095.639999999999s)]
*  He's telling the truth. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6096.639999999999s)]
*  It's not like he said, I'm in Hawaii. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6097.96s)]
*  Maybe you should stop the fight then. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6100.16s)]
*  Fucking guy thinks he's in Hawaii, but he said I'm in the desert. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6101.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6107.0s)]
*  Weird. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6107.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6108.28s)]
*  That was, that was kind of a weird. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6108.48s)]
*  And I was wondering why can't they just restart it? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6111.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6114.12s)]
*  It's a, it's, it's a bummer, but you know, do you enjoy watching fights these days? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6115.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not, I mean, I don't pay attention to what's coming up that much. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6121.759999999999s)]
*  So, you know, if, if, if I kind of see it that day and I'm not doing anything, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6127.6s)]
*  I'll definitely watch it. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6132.0s)]
*  But if, you know, it's rare that I'm looking forward to certain fights. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6134.72s)]
*  I do, I am going to go to New York for the steep a John Jones fight. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6137.96s)]
*  Oh, are you? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6142.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6142.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6142.88s)]
*  That should be exciting. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6143.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6144.6s)]
*  What do you think about that fight? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6145.320000000001s)]
*  Uh, well, I think I said this, like when steep eight was champ way back when that, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6147.320000000001s)]
*  you know, I think, uh, John Jones would be a lot, or he would be a lot tougher [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6153.16s)]
*  fight than for John Jones, then, then some of the big hard hidden guys that can't [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6158.0s)]
*  wrestle very well, cause steep eight can wrestle probably not as well as John Jones. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6163.28s)]
*  So it's going to be, I think it's interesting. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6169.320000000001s)]
*  I think it's a tough one to call. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6171.4400000000005s)]
*  Steep eight has more power than Jones. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6174.4400000000005s)]
*  He's not as, um, I don't know what the right word is, but it's not as goofy. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6177.48s)]
*  He doesn't do odd things. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6185.28s)]
*  He's more, he's more straight basics, but good at them. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6187.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6192.719999999999s)]
*  So I think, I think Jones being a little bit more goofy and doing things that are [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6193.08s)]
*  a little bit different helps him a lot. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6197.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6201.44s)]
*  He's very unpredictable. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6201.5599999999995s)]
*  He always comes in with a pretty good game plan. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6202.32s)]
*  And, you know, sometimes when I think he should be shooting the whole time, he [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6204.88s)]
*  doesn't and, you know, but I think, I think, I think he could do well against [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6209.4800000000005s)]
*  steep pay as well, just, you know, he's just got to use that length. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6217.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6220.76s)]
*  I'm interested to see what happens also because steep is had a lot of time to [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6220.96s)]
*  recover, you know, it's been a long time. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6224.36s)]
*  What was wrong with them? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6227.56s)]
*  Well, the knockout to Francis was pretty rough knockout and, you know, have a good [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6228.4400000000005s)]
*  solid two years off, have a lot of time to train. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6233.76s)]
*  He wanted to put more weight on because he felt like he was a little too light in [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6236.400000000001s)]
*  the Francis fight. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6239.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6240.400000000001s)]
*  I'm interested to see him, you know, fully healthy, like how much he's got left in [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6241.84s)]
*  the tank. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6246.08s)]
*  Cause if you go back to the steep pay that knocked out Fabricio over doom, the [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6246.56s)]
*  steep pay that knocked out a junior dos Santos steep, it was a bad fucking man. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6249.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6254.4400000000005s)]
*  I think a lot of people are looking past him in this fight. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6255.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6258.76s)]
*  I don't think John Jones is the same as he was before he tested positive, like [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6259.16s)]
*  for the third time on things, you know, maybe he's really not doing anything [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6267.5199999999995s)]
*  nowadays and he's just, I don't feel like he, his body is the same. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6272.92s)]
*  It's heavyweight now, but before he went to heavyweight, he just looked softer. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6277.72s)]
*  He didn't look as good, good of cardio. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6281.72s)]
*  Wasn't as, I don't know. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6284.36s)]
*  He just didn't fight the same as he did back when, you know, he was kind of [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6286.6s)]
*  possibly when he was testing positive, I should say. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6292.8s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6296.4800000000005s)]
*  So I always felt like John just wasn't challenged and that when John was, when [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6297.200000000001s)]
*  he defended the title a bunch of times, first of all, he's partying a lot, right? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6302.4400000000005s)]
*  He wasn't necessarily training that hard. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6306.04s)]
*  You know, like he basically said the, for the Gustafson fight, which was one of his [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6308.6s)]
*  toughest fights, he didn't even train. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6311.88s)]
*  He barely showed up. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6313.8s)]
*  He just kind of like just thought no way this guy's going to beat me. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6314.96s)]
*  I'm going to go fuck him up. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6318.04s)]
*  And Gustafson came in real prepared and John had a dig deep. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6319.08s)]
*  And most impressive thing about that is he pulled that fight out in the later [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6323.360000000001s)]
*  rounds when he wasn't really training. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6326.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6331.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6332.16s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6333.04s)]
*  I just feel like he doesn't look what, how he used to. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6334.12s)]
*  Well, he definitely doesn't have heavyweight. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6337.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, when I say look, I don't mean physically. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6339.6s)]
*  Oh, you mean like how you mean? [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6343.56s)]
*  A little bit physically, but when he was at 205, he still looked a little soft his [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6344.32s)]
*  last couple of times there compared to what he used to look like. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6349.2s)]
*  Anything that might've been from stuff. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6353.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6356.16s)]
*  Could be. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6357.08s)]
*  Definitely. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6358.92s)]
*  Pico grams. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6360.28s)]
*  I mean, but he had tested positive before, so it's not like, and that's crazy how [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6363.0s)]
*  they just had only even during USADA, they just slapped him on the wrist. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6368.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6373.76s)]
*  I never understood that. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6374.44s)]
*  I don't know what the thought of that was. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6375.72s)]
*  I don't know what the explanation for that was. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6378.24s)]
*  I can't really remember, but it was, I think that they thought that that was a tainted [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6379.76s)]
*  supplement, which does happen. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6383.16s)]
*  Well, what's his face? [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6386.68s)]
*  Sue the company for tainted substances and got a ton of money. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6388.68s)]
*  The other Cuban, I think it's Cuban. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6393.8s)]
*  Not Hector Lombard. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6396.96s)]
*  Oh, Yoel Romero. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6398.68s)]
*  That's right. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6399.96s)]
*  He did. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6400.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6401.12s)]
*  That's right. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6401.8s)]
*  He did. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6402.16s)]
*  I think Tim Means popped accidentally too, from a tainted supplement. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6402.84s)]
*  And Tim doesn't look or he does anything. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6407.96s)]
*  You know, he looks totally natural. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6409.96s)]
*  The early days when you were fighting, you kind of must've assumed that [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6412.160000000001s)]
*  everybody was on something. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6415.68s)]
*  Yeah, but nothing you could do about it. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6417.52s)]
*  And it doesn't matter. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6420.040000000001s)]
*  I'm going to beat him anyway. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6422.6s)]
*  It was my attitude. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6424.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6426.320000000001s)]
*  And you did. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6427.240000000001s)]
*  Most of the time. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6428.240000000001s)]
*  Most of the time. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6429.280000000001s)]
*  Tried to. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6430.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6431.68s)]
*  When you look back, I mean, you had a fucking amazing career, man. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6433.360000000001s)]
*  Amazing career as a wrestler and then amazing career as an MMA fighter. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6436.68s)]
*  I mean, it's gotta feel good. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6441.0s)]
*  You, you literally lived a great life. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6442.56s)]
*  No, for sure. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6445.280000000001s)]
*  And, and, you know, the book that I got coming out, it made me, made [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6446.040000000001s)]
*  me remember a lot of things, you know, not that I forgot, but it just [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6451.68s)]
*  brings a lot more things fresher in your mind and kind of, I don't [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6456.88s)]
*  it's not like I sit around and reflect about what I've done in my life. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6462.639999999999s)]
*  You know, I just keep moving forward, but that book kind of made me do that. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6465.48s)]
*  And, and, you know, it was, it was kind of fun to kind of look at my [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6471.08s)]
*  life in that way for sure. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6476.16s)]
*  And I'm sure it brought back a ton of memories. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6478.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6481.24s)]
*  And it's funny when we were writing it, you know, I'd always come up with. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6482.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6487.96s)]
*  After I'd read, read it after, you know, it was kind of written down there. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6488.12s)]
*  I was like, Oh, you know, I forgot about this story or that story that, you [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6491.6s)]
*  know, kind of goes with that. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6495.88s)]
*  So we had to kind of add a bunch of shit. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6496.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6500.0s)]
*  It made it a little tougher because I feel like I've forgotten more things [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6500.52s)]
*  that I remember these days, but you never know. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6505.0s)]
*  Uh, but yeah. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6507.400000000001s)]
*  Did you do an audio version of it? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6508.64s)]
*  Uh, no, but I was like, Oh, it'd be cool to actually read it myself and in the [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6510.84s)]
*  audio thing with my voice and, and they wanted me to send a sample of that. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6517.08s)]
*  I did like a five minute. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6522.44s)]
*  I played it back to myself. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6524.84s)]
*  I'm like, Oh my God, there's no way. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6526.96s)]
*  So I sent it to him saying, yeah, we might want to think about a [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6530.36s)]
*  professional for this one, for doing this. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6534.04s)]
*  I know you can edit it, but yeah, it's not good. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6536.44s)]
*  Then my wife got home from work and I had her listen to it and we [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6539.08s)]
*  just couldn't stop laughing. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6543.68s)]
*  It was bad. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6546.28s)]
*  I mean, I'm not the best reader, I guess. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6546.96s)]
*  Well, it's tough to do. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6550.0s)]
*  It's a, there's a, there's a real skill to reading audio. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6551.12s)]
*  And trying to put the emotion part into the, what it's supposed to be. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6554.44s)]
*  Like if you're telling a story. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6561.4s)]
*  So yeah, no, there will be an audio version, but it won't be my voice. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6563.8s)]
*  So I think acting is out of the question for you. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6568.52s)]
*  Acting? [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6570.84s)]
*  Uh, I don't know. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6571.36s)]
*  I mean, I could do certain things, but I don't know if I, I really don't [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6572.72s)]
*  want to act like that much. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6576.8s)]
*  Randy's done an amazing job. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6580.6s)]
*  No, I little bit like action movies. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6582.360000000001s)]
*  I'd probably be okay at for sure. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6585.16s)]
*  But, but some of these other TV drama type shit, there's no way. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6587.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6592.6s)]
*  I mean, I just, I probably couldn't do it with a straight face. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6593.68s)]
*  They do after this, we kind of did this book and there's some producers. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6598.6s)]
*  Like I Barry Josephson, like wants to do a bio pic on me now. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6604.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6610.759999999999s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6611.639999999999s)]
*  And, and my question to that was, and question to you, how do you put [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6612.48s)]
*  your life in a two hour show? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6619.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6621.679999999999s)]
*  How do you do that without them doctoring it too? [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6621.96s)]
*  Like what they did with Mark Schultz and Foxcatcher. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6624.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6627.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's hard because they're going to want to tie it up in a nice ribbon. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6628.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6632.5599999999995s)]
*  So I mean, now they're talking about, you know, a limited series [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6632.88s)]
*  instead type of thing. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6636.2s)]
*  Oh, that'd be interesting. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6637.8s)]
*  Like a Netflix type deal. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6638.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6640.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6640.88s)]
*  That'd probably be better. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6641.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6643.16s)]
*  If they did a, your whole life in a two hour movie, what do they chop out? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6643.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, right, right. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6645.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6647.84s)]
*  What do they chop out? [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6648.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6649.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6649.32s)]
*  What would you, what would you be in your movie if it was only two hours? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6649.68s)]
*  How the fuck did you do it? [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6654.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6655.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6655.64s)]
*  It'll just be a bullshit version of your life. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6656.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6658.52s)]
*  Just to make a movie. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6659.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6660.36s)]
*  Who's the guy that's going to be in the movie? [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6660.68s)]
*  Who's going to, who'd play you? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6662.56s)]
*  Oh, I think they have a couple of guys in mind, but yeah, nobody that [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6665.4400000000005s)]
*  looks really like me exactly, but. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6670.120000000001s)]
*  Do you have anybody that can move right though? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6673.160000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6675.68s)]
*  Walk like a caveman. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6676.280000000001s)]
*  Well also punch and throw, you know, and have good takedowns. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6677.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6681.72s)]
*  The one guy that, that is a possibility. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6681.92s)]
*  I think he trains sometimes at boss's place. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6685.0s)]
*  Oh, well that's good. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6688.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, yeah, you'd have to have, you can't have just. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6689.76s)]
*  An actor that doesn't actually know how to fight. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6692.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6694.96s)]
*  It would look terrible. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6695.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6696.76s)]
*  And, and I think whoever they do pick should probably come up to [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6697.4800000000005s)]
*  my gym for a couple of months. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6701.360000000001s)]
*  And a hundred percent. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6702.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6703.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6704.4400000000005s)]
*  And you get to beat up on them a little bit. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6704.68s)]
*  Maybe that'll motivate you to get back into gym. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6708.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6711.0s)]

*  And when I was in Japan, I always had, I had like all sorts of different [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6777.88s)]
*  nicknames and they would just call me Dan. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iimru_xblBQ&t=6781.44s)]
