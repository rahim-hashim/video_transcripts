# Joe Rogan Experience #2023 - Brian Keating
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg)
*  Thank you very much for coming man and thank you for bringing all this cool stuff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=0.0s)]
*  What is this old timey telescope? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=15.84s)]
*  Is that one of the sailors used to use? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=17.44s)]
*  That's my spy glass. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=20.48s)]
*  This thing is actually one of the most important inventions ever made. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=23.72s)]
*  It really is the reason I'm probably sitting here with you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=28.96s)]
*  It's the actual tool, not this one, but the telescope is really the machine that changed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=33.04s)]
*  the world the most. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=39.44s)]
*  What's so cool about it, it acted like a lever that moved the earth from being the center [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=41.52s)]
*  of the universe back in Galileo's time. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  What year did they invent it? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=50.34s)]
*  The telescope was invented around the early 1600s and there's a popular misconception [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=51.58s)]
*  that Galileo invented it, but he didn't. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=55.6s)]
*  He actually perfected it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=57.84s)]
*  He took it from zero to one basically. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  He took this spy glass which was really never, it's amazing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=62.28s)]
*  People were using eyeglasses for many years and nobody ever thought to go take one lens, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=67.2s)]
*  take another lens and go like this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  No one had ever done that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=76.08000000000001s)]
*  There was a guy, Van Leeuwenhoek and this guy Hans Lipperche, they had been making glass [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  and they were experts at making glass in the Netherlands. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=83.44s)]
*  But Galileo heard about that and the original devices that they were making could magnify [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=87.28s)]
*  things two or three times at most. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=91.52s)]
*  But Galileo realized, hey, I can improve this and then do what mankind has always dreamt [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=93.8s)]
*  of doing, use it to make money and use it for military purposes because with a telescope [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=100.1s)]
*  you could see a ship in the Venetian Lagoon a day or two out before it would come on shore [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=105.88s)]
*  and you could see it from the ground. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=112.88s)]
*  So the distance back then was stealth technology. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=114.86s)]
*  This took away the stealth. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=118.26s)]
*  It would be like turning off the B2's ability to have stealth. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=119.26s)]
*  So he improved it so much it was just inarguable this would change the world. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=122.42s)]
*  So when was the eyeglass invented? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=126.98s)]
*  Eyeglass was invented, it's kind of cool. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=129.82s)]
*  The eyeglass was invented in probably the late 1500s, these lenses. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=132.22s)]
*  Glass used to be total crap. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=137.78s)]
*  It would be like looking through a piece of ice today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=138.94s)]
*  These lenses are super clear and super clean, modern lenses. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=141.86s)]
*  This isn't a great telescope, but it's illustrative and we can use it to do things. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  But what was so interesting to me, it's just like a quirk of history, is when these lenses [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=149.5s)]
*  were invented, before then, you didn't, I don't know what your vision is, but mine's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=154.68s)]
*  about 2020, it's getting worse as I get older obviously. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=158.86s)]
*  But before then there were no standards for how good a person's eyesight was until they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=162.3s)]
*  had say the Gutenberg Bible was published. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=167.22000000000003s)]
*  So in the 1400s and 1500s, the first movable fixed type, we had a calibrated standard where [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=169.86s)]
*  you knew how big the type font was. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=175.58s)]
*  And you could say, well, Joe can only see something at five feet away that Brian can [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=177.9s)]
*  see at 10 feet away or something like that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  So then they realized, hey, I can't see what Brian can see or I can't see what Joe can [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=184.38000000000002s)]
*  see. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=187.82000000000002s)]
*  I need some kind of augmentation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=188.82000000000002s)]
*  And they would put lenses on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  So that was in the original direction from directly from the Gutenberg Bible to glasses. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=192.36s)]
*  And then what's so funny is the glasses then led to making a telescope. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=198.84s)]
*  And then the telescope led to the earth being moved away from being the center of the universe, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=202.88s)]
*  which the Gutenberg Bible, you know, in some connotations suggested that we were. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=208.36s)]
*  So there's a direct line from the Gutenberg Bible to the glasses to the telescope to then [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=212.66s)]
*  now religion is not so centralized in the age of scientific reason. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=216.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  So when they first started using telescopes, what kind of power are we talking about? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  When Galileo improved upon it, you said it was like zero to one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=225.44s)]
*  Like how many levels of magnification? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=228.92s)]
*  So a good telescope that you can get, I always joke, you know, I'm not a doctor, but not [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=231.8s)]
*  a real doctor. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=236.16s)]
*  But the only prescription Dr. Keating makes is that you should buy your kid a telescope. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=237.6s)]
*  And actually, the reason I said this is the reason I'm probably sitting here with you [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=241.22s)]
*  is because I became a scientist thanks to getting a telescope at about age 12. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=244.44s)]
*  And you can actually see some I know you've been to like the Keck Observatories, Monaco, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=248.88s)]
*  and you've seen the night sky from there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  And that is wonderful. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  But every single thing that Galileo saw with his 20 power telescope, which is not that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=255.68s)]
*  much, not much at all. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=260.0s)]
*  You can get one of those, you know, on my website. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=261.48s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=263.52s)]
*  But that was a big improvement. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=264.52s)]
*  That was a huge improvement because now you could see there were craters on the moon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=266.0s)]
*  Now you could see there were mountains on the moon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=269.76s)]
*  The moon wasn't this perfect crystalline sphere that the Bible and the ancients had talked [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=272.24s)]
*  about. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=276.76s)]
*  It had flaws in perfections. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=277.76s)]
*  It looked like it had oceans. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=278.76s)]
*  That's why they're called mare, mare seas, the sea of tranquility. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=279.76s)]
*  You know, it really bummed me out when Samsung, when they got exposed for their digital zoom [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  for the moon, that bummed me out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=288.4s)]
*  I thought I was taking a real picture of the moon. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=290.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=292.2s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=293.2s)]
*  Where's my phone can do? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=294.2s)]
*  There's the flag. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=295.2s)]
*  It looks so clear. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=296.2s)]
*  Like, how do they do that? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=297.2s)]
*  And then someone took a photo of a blurry photo of a moon on a screen. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=298.56s)]
*  And it did it to that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=305.32s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=306.32s)]
*  But it cleared up the image. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=307.32s)]
*  It ruined the illusion. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=309.48s)]
*  They should not do that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=310.48s)]
*  No, they should not do that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=312.48s)]
*  So yeah, Galileo like boosted the magnification from just a few times. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=314.36s)]
*  That was sufficient with just a two power thing like a spyglass, like a toy thing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=318.68s)]
*  You really can't see craters on the moon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=322.68s)]
*  You can't see that there's other like mountains and so forth. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=324.26s)]
*  But Galileo really, because of the telescope, invented the scientific method, you know, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=327.32s)]
*  of observation, collecting data, refining things. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=333.92s)]
*  And then a lot of people forget the scientific method is predicated a lot of times on serendipity. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=338.72s)]
*  Like just holy crap, something happens. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=343.2s)]
*  He didn't expect to see mountain. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  He wasn't saying my hypothesis is that it formed from the same planetary system as the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=346.56s)]
*  earth. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=350.32s)]
*  He just saw it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=351.32s)]
*  Holy crap. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=352.32s)]
*  And what was the very best telescope that he created as he made them better? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=353.32s)]
*  It only went up to about 20 times because that the ability to grind glass was always [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=358.68s)]
*  the limiting factor. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=363.76s)]
*  He understood the mathematics of it, which was also part like how is what's called lens [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=365.16s)]
*  equation? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=368.96s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=369.96s)]
*  How does light get refracted and focused and in so doing bend and magnify light? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  And so he understood it mathematically and could prove it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=375.86s)]
*  But he also did something really cool, which people don't appreciate. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=377.88s)]
*  The lens in this telescope, I don't know, should I show it? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=381.04s)]
*  The lens in the telescope is actually bigger than this brass piece that surrounds it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=385.64s)]
*  And that owes to Galileo's activity. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=391.0s)]
*  So what Galileo realized is sometimes you don't want to use everything that you have. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=393.8s)]
*  Sometimes you want to do what's called stopping down. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=398.52s)]
*  So for aperture stops in photography. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=400.68s)]
*  So when you stop down something, it does something really important. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=403.44s)]
*  It reduces what are called systematic effects, aberrations, unwanted effects. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=407.21999999999997s)]
*  So instead of maximizing, say, I got the biggest telescope, which is what now astronomers [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=412.84s)]
*  fight about my telescope is bigger than yours. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=417.11999999999995s)]
*  He said, no, no, no, you want to stop it down and now I'll actually improve the quality. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=419.38s)]
*  And you can actually see this with your own fingers. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=423.84s)]
*  So take your fingers out, Joe. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=425.52s)]
*  Look at some light source. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=427.28s)]
*  Look at these stars above us. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=428.28s)]
*  Make a tiny little triangle with your fingers, your two fingers and your thumb. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=429.88s)]
*  And then go around like one of the stars up there and you can actually see it pinch it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=434.97999999999996s)]
*  down to almost a point and you can almost see that it will magnify a tiny, tiny bit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=439.0s)]
*  And you get that effect. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=445.2s)]
*  It's very subtle. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=447.12s)]
*  But you're actually reducing some of the rays outside of your peripheral vision, essentially, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=449.04s)]
*  that would otherwise come in if you have any like cataracts or anything like that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=454.16s)]
*  So what Galileo said is no, don't use everything you have. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=457.44s)]
*  Actually stop it down, make it smaller, make it seem less efficient, but actually improve [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=461.18s)]
*  the quality, not the quantity tremendously. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=465.28s)]
*  And when did they first start getting them to the point where you get telescopes like [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=468.52s)]
*  the Keck Observatory? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that was so the Keck Observatory and the modern telescopes that we use today [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  are not this type of telescope. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  This is called a refracting telescope. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  It uses lenses. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=484.24s)]
*  The lenses change the speed of light inside of the medium and that causes light waves [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=485.84s)]
*  at different angles to travel through different thicknesses and travel slower and that causes [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  them to converge or diverge as necessary. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=495.28s)]
*  And nowadays that so this telescope was invented by this guy, Hans Lippershey, perfected by [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=498.08s)]
*  Galileo. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  Isaac Newton came along almost 100 years later. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=505.28s)]
*  Actually, he was born when Galileo died in 1642. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=508.2s)]
*  And he invented not a refracting telescope, but a reflecting telescope of the type that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=512.92s)]
*  the Keck telescopes you've seen are. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=518.24s)]
*  These are telescopes that use mirrors like to focus the light. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=520.22s)]
*  They can be made much bigger. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=524.12s)]
*  They can be made much more clearer because you don't need glass. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=525.78s)]
*  You just need highly reflective media. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=529.4s)]
*  And crucially, they can be supported behind them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=531.52s)]
*  So imagine if you made the biggest telescope of this kind, you know, kind of cheap, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=534.48s)]
*  So I only brought a small phone I could put on. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=539.5s)]
*  Actually, TSA almost confiscated this today. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=541.48s)]
*  They were like, what the hell is this thing? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=543.28s)]
*  They don't know what a telescope is? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=544.76s)]
*  They were like, what is this? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=547.28s)]
*  Are you going to use it as a weapon? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=548.28s)]
*  But they can only be made 30 times the diameter of this telescope, of this little tiny thing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=550.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=555.5s)]
*  The biggest refracting telescope. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=556.5s)]
*  So those ones that look like a garbage can in people's backyards. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=557.5s)]
*  Those are reflecting telescopes. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=561.62s)]
*  The biggest refracting telescope is in Yerkes Observatory outside of Chicago or southern [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=563.0600000000001s)]
*  Wisconsin. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=567.7800000000001s)]
*  And it is only 39 inches across. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=569.0400000000001s)]
*  So what happens is, imagine you have a piece of glass over time, the glass will start to... [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=571.58s)]
*  That it right there? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=577.3000000000001s)]
*  That's it, perfect. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=578.3000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's pretty cool. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=579.3000000000001s)]
*  Her Jamie's good, wow. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=580.78s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=581.78s)]
*  So that's Yerkes. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=582.78s)]
*  That's puny compared to what you've seen in the Keck Observatories, which are 10 meters [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=583.78s)]
*  across, 10 times that diameter. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=588.9799999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=591.06s)]
*  And what kind of power does that one have? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=592.06s)]
*  So you can get a telescope that has arbitrary power. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=594.2199999999999s)]
*  The power is not the important thing. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=597.5s)]
*  What's important is how clear and high quality the image can be. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=600.2199999999999s)]
*  You can have like the digital zoom. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=603.3s)]
*  When they zoom in on your phone, say, if you zoom in, the image quality gets crappy, but [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=605.5s)]
*  even if it says, oh, you've magnified it 300 times. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=610.58s)]
*  So you can magnify arbitrarily just by choosing the right ratio of the curvature of the lens [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=613.1s)]
*  and the distance between these two lenses. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=617.54s)]
*  But to get higher quality, that Yerkes Observatory lens started to sag, and it has other problems. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=619.94s)]
*  Light acts, no matter what, gets distorted when it goes through a medium. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=626.3s)]
*  It's actually getting distorted right now as it goes through the air. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=631.2s)]
*  When you've seen this effect, here's my second prop of the day. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=634.52s)]
*  This is a prism. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=637.48s)]
*  This is a prism made of just like ordinary glass, plexiglass, and that refracts light [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=638.48s)]
*  depending on its wavelength. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=643.6s)]
*  So this is like the kind of stuff a hippie girl would keep on her desk, right? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=644.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=650.28s)]
*  You can make it into a pendant for your wife. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=651.28s)]
*  So that is changing the color. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  The speed of light is getting modified depending on its color as it goes through that medium. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=656.6s)]
*  The lesson is glass affects the color of light's propagation speed, and it affects the quality [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=661.42s)]
*  of it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  It's called chromatic aberration. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=669.6999999999999s)]
*  So there's aberration because of the defects like a crack in the glass. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=670.6999999999999s)]
*  There's also a defect that different wavelengths or colors of light will focus at different [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=674.56s)]
*  points on your eye or on a detector. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=679.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's bad because you want everything to come to a point focus. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  You want everything to be perfectly sharp and focused. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=685.86s)]
*  And so these lenses, once they get above a certain size, they cannot be corrected for [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=688.52s)]
*  this effect. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=692.18s)]
*  I've actually done quite a lot of work with binoculars because I was trying to figure [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=693.9s)]
*  out what's the difference in binoculars for outdoor activities. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=698.9s)]
*  And there's such a difference when you get to the higher quality binoculars. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=703.68s)]
*  It's really fascinating because they both have the same, they have different, it's 10x42. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=708.02s)]
*  So I guess 42 would be... [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=715.02s)]
*  42 is usually the eyepiece relief. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=717.52s)]
*  It's basically the field, related to the field of view. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=720.04s)]
*  And how much light it takes in. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=722.76s)]
*  Yeah, and the 10 is the magnification. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=723.76s)]
*  The superior ones, when you get to like the Swarovski is probably the best. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=725.76s)]
*  Their glass is so clear. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=730.8s)]
*  Like if you look through a 10x binocular that's fairly cheap and inexpensive, you look at [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=733.4s)]
*  it like, yeah, it looks good. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=738.48s)]
*  I can see it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=739.48s)]
*  And then you put the Swarovski on, you're like, oh my God. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=740.48s)]
*  It's like headphones, right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=743.04s)]
*  You can get like a piece of the stock headphones from your iPhone. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=744.06s)]
*  And you can get really high quality ones. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=747.06s)]
*  And so these headphones do not distort because they're premium headphones. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=749.02s)]
*  They don't distort the different wavelengths of sound. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=752.9399999999999s)]
*  Just like the wavelengths of light or its colors, wavelengths of sound should not be [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=755.86s)]
*  distorted and it's harder to amplify a signal of higher frequency or a shorter wavelength. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=759.62s)]
*  So the net effect was they realized you could only build a telescope using glass that was [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=764.86s)]
*  that big. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=770.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=771.26s)]
*  So if you look at the telescope using mirrors, right now in space we've got the six meter [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=772.48s)]
*  diameter Webb telescope, which is six times bigger than the Yerkes Observatory. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=776.0s)]
*  And that's in space. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=780.56s)]
*  That's a million miles away from the Earth. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=781.56s)]
*  But that's built with reflecting technology. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=783.36s)]
*  So when you see a mirror, mirrors reflect colors independently. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=785.72s)]
*  It doesn't change the color. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=789.88s)]
*  You don't see, oh, I look different if I'm in a red light versus a blue light. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=790.88s)]
*  They have no chromatic aberration. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  They also can be supported from behind. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=796.92s)]
*  With our Simons Observatory, which I'm working with some amazing scientists around the world. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=799.5s)]
*  This is a sticker for you. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=804.22s)]
*  So this is in Chile. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=806.38s)]
*  This is currently the world's highest operating astronomical observatory. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=807.38s)]
*  It's at 5200 meters, 17,200 feet above sea level. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=810.9s)]
*  And the telescope that's pictured there is the six meter diameter we call the Large Aperture [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=815.7s)]
*  Telescope that my friend Mark Devlin... [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=821.02s)]
*  Is this the VLT one that I keep hearing about? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=822.82s)]
*  No, this is the Simons. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=825.86s)]
*  This is just called the Simons Observatory. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=827.12s)]
*  So when our mutual friend Eric Weinstein was on last time, he talked a lot about this man, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=828.96s)]
*  James Simons, who organized and ran the math department at the State University of New [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=833.4000000000001s)]
*  York in Santa Barbara. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=839.36s)]
*  But he's become a... [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=840.36s)]
*  He's one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the world. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=841.8800000000001s)]
*  So this is the precursor observatory. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=844.6800000000001s)]
*  This is led by my friends Suzanne Staggs and Mark Devlin at Princeton, Penn, irrespective... [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=846.9200000000001s)]
*  Not respectively, but the other way around. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=855.44s)]
*  And then the Simons Observatory on the left, if you go over just a tiny bit, Jamie... [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=858.04s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=861.2199999999999s)]
*  So if you click on the Wikipedia there, there it is. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=862.2199999999999s)]
*  Those are two reflecting enormous six meter diameter mirrors. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=864.9s)]
*  What happens is light comes in from above, from the cosmos, reflects off the one that's [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  tilted at a 45 degree angle here, bounces up to the other one on the left, then that [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=874.06s)]
*  shoots across here. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=880.12s)]
*  Actually, let me try this. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=881.66s)]
*  I'm a Professor Joe, so this won't show up on the screen. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=883.54s)]
*  Then it goes across and it goes into that white little chamber over there. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=887.12s)]
*  That white chamber, I could sit on your back and we would have plenty of room inside there. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=890.76s)]
*  That's over six and a half feet across. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=896.5999999999999s)]
*  This is also built by Mark Devlin and his group and detectors by my friend Suzanne Staggs [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=898.76s)]
*  at Princeton. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=903.48s)]
*  And this is going to be the world's most sensitive and the world's highest operating observatory [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=904.48s)]
*  when we start taking data with it next year. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=909.56s)]
*  But you see it's reflective. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=912.04s)]
*  It's supported from the bottom. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=913.04s)]
*  You could not do this with lenses. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=914.04s)]
*  In a project like this, this magnitude, how many years did it take to construct something [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=915.8399999999999s)]
*  like this? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=919.88s)]
*  With or without COVID is the question. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=920.88s)]
*  We started in 2016. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=923.5999999999999s)]
*  My friend David Spurgle, who's now the president of the Simons Foundation and is leading NASA's [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=925.68s)]
*  UAP Task Force. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=931.4799999999999s)]
*  I hope we can talk about that at some point. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=932.76s)]
*  David's one of the greatest mentors I've ever had. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=936.76s)]
*  He and I and others, Adrian Lee at Berkeley, we decided we want to build the world's most [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=939.92s)]
*  capable astronomical observatory and happened to be very close and connected to James Simons. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=945.28s)]
*  His original job was math professor at the State University of New York called Stonybrook. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=951.12s)]
*  And he hired my father, my late father, which maybe we'll talk about later. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=957.48s)]
*  And they were best friends for a long time. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=962.0s)]
*  And then Jim Simons went on to become one of the most successful hedge fund managers. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=964.24s)]
*  He quit being a math professor and said, I'm going to start trading futures and commodities [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=970.28s)]
*  back in the early 70s. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=975.52s)]
*  Nobody did this. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=976.52s)]
*  And he developed algorithms that to this day still return over 30 percent a year. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  So Jim is I think the 26 richest man in the world. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=984.0s)]
*  He's dedicated his fortune to two things. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=987.32s)]
*  One, fighting autism because it's extremely close to his heart and two, to solving basic [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=989.4000000000001s)]
*  physics problems in science and math and chemistry and computer science. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=996.1600000000001s)]
*  So he's not doing applied stuff. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1000.12s)]
*  He's not trying to make technology. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1001.6800000000001s)]
*  He's not trying to make a better iPhone or something like that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1003.46s)]
*  He's dedicated purely to making the advances in pure science with no application. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1006.4200000000001s)]
*  So this experiment was started. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1012.22s)]
*  We pitched it to him, David Spurgle and I and Mark Devlin and Suzanne Staggs and Adrienne [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1013.74s)]
*  Leigh. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1017.7s)]
*  We pitched it to him in 2016 and we got funding for it around that time. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1018.7s)]
*  And since then, we've had COVID, we've had tremendous numbers of strikes and things going [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1024.38s)]
*  on in Chile. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1029.94s)]
*  And don't forget, Chile is in the southern hemisphere. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1030.94s)]
*  So when we had like our first wave of COVID, like they got their first wave six months [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1033.3s)]
*  later because it was at a phase of our seasons. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1036.94s)]
*  It was a nightmare. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1039.34s)]
*  And we can't just say to my graduate student, hey, come back in two years on the pandemic [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1040.46s)]
*  or come back when there's a vaccine or do whatever you want. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1044.3799999999999s)]
*  We instead said, no, we kept it going and the foundation kept paying us and we kept [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1047.46s)]
*  it going. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1051.78s)]
*  So now we just yesterday, my colleague Adrienne Leigh deployed the first receiver along with [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1052.78s)]
*  Nick Olitski, who's a professor right up the street here at UT Austin. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1058.06s)]
*  They deployed this telescope camera and that we're about to start taking data for the first [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1061.22s)]
*  time in our project history. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1065.58s)]
*  Wow, that's very exciting. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1066.98s)]
*  It is. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1067.98s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1068.98s)]
*  And how much more capable is that? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1069.98s)]
*  Is it more capable? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1071.8600000000001s)]
*  But is it also the position that it's in in terms of the altitude that it's at? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1073.14s)]
*  It's a lot of those things. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1077.82s)]
*  So the altitude is 17,200 feet. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1078.82s)]
*  When you're up there, you need oxygen. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1082.1000000000001s)]
*  Like when you were up at Mauna Kea, I've been there a few times. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1083.6200000000001s)]
*  Like I get out of breath if I walk up a flight of stairs in Mauna Kea. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1086.6000000000001s)]
*  When I'm at the site in Chile, I get out of breath walking down a flight of stairs. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1090.24s)]
*  I'm not in that shape. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1094.52s)]
*  17,200. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1096.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1097.52s)]
*  It's like being on the surface of Mars. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1098.52s)]
*  You would love it because first of all, the people there are incredible. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1102.0s)]
*  They've been doing astronomy since a thousand years before our country was even founded. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1105.6s)]
*  There were people in the Inca societies, the ancient Incas. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1109.56s)]
*  They were studying their interpretation of the cosmos. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1112.48s)]
*  today where they have prioritized astronomy as central to Chile's GDP. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1116.86s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1121.82s)]
*  It's such an amazing place to be. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1122.82s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1124.5s)]
*  And so what we do there is it's such a high altitude site. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1125.74s)]
*  You're above half the oxygen content that we feel here near sea level in Austin. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1128.4799999999998s)]
*  Up there, you're wearing nasal cannulas. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1134.2199999999998s)]
*  You have to breathe pure oxygen almost all the time. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1136.2199999999998s)]
*  And if you don't, you'll pass out and we won't let you out there. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1138.9799999999998s)]
*  He could just hang around, not even like Wim Hof, the Iceman. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1142.76s)]
*  He probably could. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1146.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1147.04s)]
*  He'd have to sign a waiver before I'd let him up there. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1148.04s)]
*  I'd be happy to do that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1149.48s)]
*  I'd be up there deep breathing on the moon. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1151.04s)]
*  It's got like insane ultraviolet exposure up there. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1155.2s)]
*  You can basically when you're up there and you look straight up here when you're at that [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1158.16s)]
*  altitude, it's like you're looking into space because when you're above that altitude, there's [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1163.24s)]
*  not enough water in the atmosphere to really precipitate out. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1167.68s)]
*  You grew up in Boston. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1172.24s)]
*  Remember some days in the past, we used to get, I grew up in New York, outside of Long [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1173.24s)]
*  Island. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1177.9599999999998s)]
*  Some days you'd get this thing on the news channel, on the radio, you'd hear it, you'd [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1178.9599999999998s)]
*  be so happy. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1182.0s)]
*  It's snowing today or whatever. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1183.0s)]
*  Oh, you got a snow day. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1184.0s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1185.48s)]
*  But some days, they'd say, unfortunately, whatever. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1186.48s)]
*  We were saved. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1190.52s)]
*  It's too cold to snow. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1191.52s)]
*  You remember sometimes it'd be like it's just too cold to snow and you're like, what the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1192.52s)]
*  hell? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1196.6799999999998s)]
*  Why is it too cold to snow? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1197.6799999999998s)]
*  So we wouldn't get a snow day in those cases. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1198.6799999999998s)]
*  The water can be, the air temperature can be so low that the water vapor can't crystallize, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  nucleate and form snow. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1205.28s)]
*  And that's what happens there a lot of the time. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1206.8s)]
*  So it's so clear. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1208.36s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1209.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1210.36s)]
*  It's the second most incredible place I've ever been. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1211.36s)]
*  I've never been able to recreate my experience the first time I went to the Keck Observatory. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1213.6s)]
*  But it was, we just caught lightning in a bottle. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1219.24s)]
*  And I remember when we were driving up there, we had been staying on the Big Island and [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1222.12s)]
*  we stayed on the Big Island specifically because I wanted to go to the observatory. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1226.4399999999998s)]
*  I was like, I just want to see it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1230.1999999999998s)]
*  I keep hearing that it's insane. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1231.8s)]
*  And as we were driving up the mountain, it was cloudy. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, this sucks. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1237.4799999999998s)]
*  We got a cloudy day. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1239.04s)]
*  Oh, well, you know, we'll go up there anyway and we'll see what it's like and look at their [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1240.28s)]
*  telescopes and all that jazz. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  But then you drove through the clouds. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1247.12s)]
*  So it was so high out there that you passed through the clouds and then it was just crystal [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1249.6399999999999s)]
*  clear. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1253.9599999999998s)]
*  And I swear it changed my life. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1255.04s)]
*  Like just looking at it that way. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1256.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't think I know everyone knows that we're in space, but you don't see it that way all [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1258.44s)]
*  the time because I just don't think it's possible unless you live in some very rural area. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1266.28s)]
*  Well, you mentioned this. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1271.1200000000001s)]
*  You said like it's a tragedy that we suffer from light pollution. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1272.0s)]
*  So much so you said that we don't even know what we don't see. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1275.48s)]
*  Yeah, we don't. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1278.48s)]
*  We have no understanding of what's above us and that the ancients used to see every single [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1279.3600000000001s)]
*  day. That's what they saw every night. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1285.24s)]
*  So much so that this is a beautiful picture that Jamie's showing. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1287.8000000000002s)]
*  This is the Alma. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1290.8400000000001s)]
*  This is what stands for Atacama, which is the desert that we're in. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1291.76s)]
*  It's the driest desert on Earth. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1294.48s)]
*  It's the highest desert on Earth because it's, you know, 5000 meters, 17000 feet in the Andes [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1295.76s)]
*  Mountains. And this picture is showing these this band that's arcing overhead. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1300.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the Milky Way galaxy. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1305.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm a professional astronomer, Joe. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1307.2800000000002s)]
*  When I go down there, I can't recognize the constellations that I know and I've known since [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1308.92s)]
*  I was 12 years old because there's no contra like every star just is like blowing you away. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1314.72s)]
*  And it's just magnified so much by the clarity and the distance and the remove from light [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1320.1200000000001s)]
*  pollution. It is a toxic, you know, it is preventing our children from understanding what the [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1325.28s)]
*  ancients knew. But the great thing about that shot, Jamie, if we could keep it up for just a [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  second longer. So you see on the left there, these two smudges there, those you can barely [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1335.52s)]
*  see from from Hawaii. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1340.0s)]
*  I don't know if you saw them. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1341.28s)]
*  Those are called the large and small Magellanic clouds. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1342.3999999999999s)]
*  Those are satellite galaxies of the Milky Way galaxy. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1345.08s)]
*  We're in the Milky Way galaxy. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1349.6799999999998s)]
*  We're in this disk. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1351.1999999999998s)]
*  And what I brought here, this is a representation of the cosmic microwave background. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1352.6s)]
*  This is made by my friends, Lyman Page and David Spurgle and others on the Wilkinson [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1357.1599999999999s)]
*  microwave, anisotropy probe. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1362.32s)]
*  This is God's view of the cosmos, if you will. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1363.9599999999998s)]
*  So this is what you'd see if you were sensitive to microwave vision instead of optical light. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1366.84s)]
*  So microwaves are longer than infrared light. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1372.24s)]
*  They're longer wavelength than the shorter than radio waves and they're longer than infrared [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1374.32s)]
*  light, much longer than visible light. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1378.96s)]
*  These this would be your microwave constellations. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1380.76s)]
*  In other words, if you could see, these are unchanging fixed patterns on the sky that are [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1383.88s)]
*  only visible to microwave instruments. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1388.24s)]
*  This satellite made this image running across here. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1390.1200000000001s)]
*  This orange band around it is the Milky Way, but as seen in microwaves. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1392.48s)]
*  So you just saw it as seen in optical. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1397.44s)]
*  So the Milky Way emits at all frequencies. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1400.4799999999998s)]
*  You can't get rid of it because we're inside the galaxy. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1402.7199999999998s)]
*  So this, as I say, this is as if God is like looking down. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1406.0s)]
*  We're actually at the center of this ball here and we're looking out of that galaxy, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1408.84s)]
*  out towards the galaxy. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1413.12s)]
*  But we're on one of the arms of the spiral galaxy. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1414.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's one of the gloves and there's a little telescope. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1416.1999999999998s)]
*  Something's horning into my racket there. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1418.1599999999999s)]
*  Little planet factory. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1419.6799999999998s)]
*  Watch yourself. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1420.6799999999998s)]
*  Watch yourself. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1421.6799999999998s)]
*  I got the little telescopes in the microwave, but beach ball. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1422.6799999999998s)]
*  So that's what the galaxy looks like. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1426.6s)]
*  What is all that schmutz? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1429.32s)]
*  What is all that blue stuff? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1430.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't see that when you're in Mauna Kea, right? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1432.28s)]
*  That is dust. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1435.1599999999999s)]
*  That's dust in the Milky Way galaxy. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1436.48s)]
*  Put that back up there. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1438.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1439.52s)]
*  So actually, if you go back, Jamie, to the ALMA picture that you showed just a second [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1440.52s)]
*  ago, the Incas were really fascinating culture and astronomically speaking. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1446.3999999999999s)]
*  We look at the stars. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1454.04s)]
*  I don't know how many constellations you can recognize, but the Incas, they didn't use [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1455.88s)]
*  our constellations obviously. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1461.76s)]
*  They didn't like say... [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1462.76s)]
*  The Big Dipper. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1463.76s)]
*  Yeah, the Big Dipper. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1464.76s)]
*  Right, anything like that. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1465.76s)]
*  But they instead focused on those dark blanches. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1466.76s)]
*  Those dark blanches are not regions representing the absence of stars. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1470.0s)]
*  Those dark blanches are obscured. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1475.72s)]
*  There are billions of stars there, but they're obscured by clouds of dust, basically like [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1478.6000000000001s)]
*  particles of carbon, of silicon, metals I'm going to show you in just a bit. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1484.6000000000001s)]
*  They pollute and they obscure and make opaque the stars behind them. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1489.24s)]
*  So the Incas could see this much more clearly. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1494.72s)]
*  We can't see these from where we are in the Northern Hemisphere, but the Incas could see [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1497.4s)]
*  it. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1500.92s)]
*  So they made their constellations, shapes that they saw in those dark, dusty globules. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1501.92s)]
*  So if you were born back then, let's say you just had your birthday, right? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1509.2s)]
*  So you were born back then, August 11th? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1513.52s)]
*  11th, yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1516.12s)]
*  So you were born in August. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1517.12s)]
*  I forget what's your sign? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1519.12s)]
*  Libra? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  Leo. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1521.8799999999999s)]
*  Leo, okay. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  So instead of being a Leo, they would represent you by what constellation, what dust blob [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1523.8799999999999s)]
*  there was, and they had names for it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1528.12s)]
*  There was a toad, there was a llama. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1529.8s)]
*  My favorite one, Joe, there was a constellation called the umbilical cord of the llama. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1532.44s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1537.2s)]
*  Can you imagine going to a bar, to the mothership? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1538.2s)]
*  Hey, baby. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1540.52s)]
*  What's your sign? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1541.52s)]
*  The umbilicus of the llama. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1542.52s)]
*  It's just ridiculous, right? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1544.28s)]
*  But that's what they saw. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1546.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1548.04s)]
*  And we can't see that today, not because of light pollution, but we can't see all the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1549.04s)]
*  other things because of light pollution. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1552.84s)]
*  But yeah, those two little smudges on the left, those are galaxies, or dwarf galaxies [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1554.56s)]
*  that are bound to the dark matter and the gravitational pull of the Milky Way. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1559.12s)]
*  They're actually satellite galaxies. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1564.76s)]
*  They're separate from the Milky Way. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1566.44s)]
*  And how many stars are in those galaxies? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1567.72s)]
*  A couple billion. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1569.6s)]
*  Can we have a hundred billion at least? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1571.74s)]
*  Look how, you know what's insane is the density of stars. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1573.34s)]
*  That was one of the things that was so overwhelming because I always knew there was a lot of stars, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1576.98s)]
*  but just the density that it's as much star as it is black when you look at the sky. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1582.14s)]
*  It's like you're seeing a different, a different perspective, completely different perspective. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1588.06s)]
*  It felt like I was in the cockpit of a massive spaceship, like looking at it through glass. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1592.32s)]
*  When you go up there, you probably weren't on oxygen because you were on a tour or something [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1598.58s)]
*  like that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1601.98s)]
*  If you go up a little bit higher, so I'm a pilot, I fly little planes around Southern [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1602.98s)]
*  California. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1607.1000000000001s)]
*  But if you go above the altitude that you were at, it's legally required that you wear [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1608.5s)]
*  oxygen or you have an oxygen provider, you're a pressurized plane or whatever. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1611.9s)]
*  So you would wear a canula if you were in like a little Cessna or something like that [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1615.3s)]
*  and they can get up to that altitude easily. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1618.7s)]
*  But if you don't have oxygen on and you go up there, next time you go up there, you look [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1621.9s)]
*  up, you close your eyes for a second, you hold your breath. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1627.06s)]
*  I'm not suggesting this, it's not me telling you to do this, but if you do it, you will [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1631.46s)]
*  see apparitions of the stars. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1638.3s)]
*  It will make you feel like you're tripping. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1640.22s)]
*  So I'm told I've never tripped. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1642.82s)]
*  So because you're holding your breath? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1644.6799999999998s)]
*  Because you're oxygen deprived, the intensity of starlight and the contrast, as you just [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1647.1s)]
*  and the lightness and the points of light, it will be essentially like you're basically [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1652.82s)]
*  out of your senses. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1658.78s)]
*  You won't be able to process it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1659.78s)]
*  I wonder if we're going to get to a point with technology that we figure out how to [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1661.82s)]
*  use some sort of diffuse lighting everywhere where we minimize light pollution, at least [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1666.26s)]
*  minimize it to the point where you do see stars. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1671.98s)]
*  I think it really is a bad thing for us. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1675.1399999999999s)]
*  I think it's akin to people not getting sunlight in the winter. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1677.78s)]
*  They don't do well because they don't get vitamin D. I think there's something psychological. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1682.3s)]
*  There's a medicine to the awe-inspiring cosmos. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1688.06s)]
*  So funny you said that. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1692.1s)]
*  I haven't met Andrew Huberman. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1693.94s)]
*  He used to be a professor at UC San Diego where I am now. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1695.82s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1697.8999999999999s)]
*  Love that guy. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1698.8999999999999s)]
*  You'd love him. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1699.8999999999999s)]
*  He's such an amazing contributor. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1700.8999999999999s)]
*  His whole shtick is get out in the morning, see the morning sunlight. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1702.5s)]
*  What I want to talk to him about, because he's an expert in the eye and the physiology [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  of the eye as well as all the other stuff that he does for his laboratory. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1709.1s)]
*  But I want to ask him about astronomical things. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1714.46s)]
*  We see that night sky. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1717.1799999999998s)]
*  What will it mean to our physiology and to our psychology to have that rob from a whole [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1720.1s)]
*  ... We're doing an experiment. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1725.1399999999999s)]
*  Nobody knows what will happen, as you just said. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1727.1799999999998s)]
*  What will happen? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1729.4199999999998s)]
*  Will it be like sitting is the new smoking or sitting is the new crack? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1730.58s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1734.62s)]
*  But that's the point. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1736.26s)]
*  What will it mean? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1737.6599999999999s)]
*  There's something deeply into the human mind. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1738.6599999999999s)]
*  The reasons that constellations have names is because there was no Netflix. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1740.8999999999999s)]
*  There was no Netflix 2,000 years ago. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1745.3s)]
*  People identified things and they could navigate. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1747.6599999999999s)]
*  I can sort of navigate by ... I know the constellations incredibly well, which doesn't sound so big [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1750.1799999999998s)]
*  a deal as an astronomer. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1754.8999999999999s)]
*  You're like, but most astronomers don't really care. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1756.2199999999998s)]
*  They don't know the constellations. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1758.3799999999999s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1759.3799999999999s)]
*  One of the jokes is don't ask me what constellation that is. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1760.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm an astronomer. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1762.5s)]
*  I always give them crap. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1763.5s)]
*  I'm always like, yeah, if you were a geography professor, I'd say, where's Mexico? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1764.54s)]
*  He said, don't ask me. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1768.14s)]
*  It's kind of ridiculous. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1769.14s)]
*  But not having that experience and just like you and I remember what it was like to have [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1771.94s)]
*  it at some level or we can go and travel to ... People can in LA, but they can do something, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1776.06s)]
*  which is quite phenomenal. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1780.7s)]
*  With the same telescope that you can get an actual version of this. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1782.4s)]
*  You can connect it to your smartphone. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1785.62s)]
*  You can have a try and ... It's $50. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1786.62s)]
*  I made a video once. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1789.14s)]
*  I said, this is the best Christmas gift you could possibly get a kid. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1790.14s)]
*  Because with it, you can see the same craters on the moon that Galileo saw. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1794.9s)]
*  Light pollution does not obscure the planets. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1799.26s)]
*  Light pollution does not make impossible ... I'm not advocating for light pollution, but [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1802.88s)]
*  I'm just saying right here in the middle of Austin or in the middle of San Diego, I can [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1806.8600000000001s)]
*  see the exact same things that caused Galileo to realize that the sun is the center of the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1810.5800000000002s)]
*  solar system using scientific reasoning and evidence based on observation. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1815.9s)]
*  How good are the telescopes? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1821.18s)]
*  Say if you wanted to look at Jupiter. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1822.8200000000002s)]
*  How much can you see? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1824.3799999999999s)]
*  You can see a lot. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1825.3799999999999s)]
*  What you can see ... You can see the shape? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1826.54s)]
*  You can see the shape that it's a planet. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1827.94s)]
*  Do you know what that word planet means or where it derives from? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1830.18s)]
*  No. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1832.06s)]
*  I love that etymology. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1833.06s)]
*  You can stop me if I'm nerding out too much. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1834.06s)]
*  The planet means wanderer in Greek. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1835.06s)]
*  Wanderer. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1837.4199999999998s)]
*  What is it wandering against? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1838.4199999999998s)]
*  The fixed stars. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1839.4199999999998s)]
*  The fact that you have names for things. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1840.4199999999998s)]
*  I always think it's funny. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1843.54s)]
*  I'm Jewish. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1844.54s)]
*  We have a name for people that aren't Jewish. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1846.04s)]
*  Goyim. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1847.94s)]
*  It's not an insult. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1848.94s)]
*  It just means nation. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1849.94s)]
*  Actually, Israel is a goy, which is a nation. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1850.94s)]
*  But we're 0.2% of the world's population. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1854.0600000000002s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1857.0600000000002s)]
*  Why are you making up names for ... They should make names for you. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1858.0600000000002s)]
*  We have names as astronomers. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1861.6200000000001s)]
*  There were only five things they could see that would move in space. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1863.98s)]
*  Those were the planets from Mercury, Venus. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1866.74s)]
*  Obviously, they could see Mars and Jupiter and Saturn. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1869.18s)]
*  They couldn't see anything else. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1872.5400000000002s)]
*  They named those things the wanderers and they wandered against the fixed stars. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1873.94s)]
*  Now we know the stars do move and actually the whole galaxy moves. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1877.94s)]
*  Potentially, we'll get to this maybe later. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1882.1399999999999s)]
*  Maybe the universe in some sense could be moving in a vaster landscape called the multiverse, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1884.3s)]
*  which we can get to at a certain point. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1890.86s)]
*  But the planets, you can see them. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1893.54s)]
*  But what's so important is what Galileo saw. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1895.1s)]
*  Jamie, if you could show this, it would be amazing. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1897.54s)]
*  Galileo in the winter of 1610 in northern Italy where he was living, he used a telescope [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1899.54s)]
*  not any better than this. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1906.42s)]
*  In fact, this might be better because the glass is better, even though it's a Chinese [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1908.3400000000001s)]
*  piece of junk I bought on eBay. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1911.7s)]
*  But he mapped, he was able to measure Jupiter and see it, and hopefully we can see it on [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1915.1000000000001s)]
*  the screen, and he saw it as a disk. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1921.0600000000002s)]
*  So if you want to see planets, you can differentiate them right now by the fact that they do not [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1924.5800000000002s)]
*  scintillate, they do not sparkle, they do not twinkle twinkle like stars do because [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1930.22s)]
*  they're extended objects that we can actually see through the same and different parts of [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1935.1399999999999s)]
*  the atmospheric column. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1940.54s)]
*  That's what causes scintillation. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1941.54s)]
*  You know, like a sniper rifle, they correct for it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1942.54s)]
*  They use what's called adaptive optics. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1945.02s)]
*  That's to avoid like the thermal radiation from the earth. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1947.3s)]
*  Like you're shooting something or elk or whatever at great distance, there's thermal radiation [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1949.54s)]
*  close to the ground and then the air is much cooler. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1953.98s)]
*  And so you get these boundary layers of the atmosphere that causes differential refraction, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1956.9199999999998s)]
*  which changes the color and the position of where the deer is, and that's not good, right? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1961.62s)]
*  So they have to correct for that using what's called adaptive optics. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1965.58s)]
*  Anyway, but the same phenomena happens for the planets. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1968.58s)]
*  They're so big, they're so close to us. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1972.1s)]
*  They're not bigger than the stars. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1973.78s)]
*  Stars are massively bigger than any of our planets, including Jupiter, the biggest planet [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1975.06s)]
*  in the solar system. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1978.62s)]
*  But because they're close to us, they don't appear to be points, and only points will [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1980.3s)]
*  twinkle. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1985.54s)]
*  So if you want to identify a star versus a plane versus a planet, the planet will be [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1986.58s)]
*  the thing that doesn't move and doesn't twinkle. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1991.22s)]
*  That's called scintillation. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1994.78s)]
*  They do not scintillate the same way that stars do. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1995.78s)]
*  So what Galileo did in January of 1610 is he made a series of observations of the planet [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=1998.06s)]
*  Jupiter. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2004.02s)]
*  He knew exactly where it was. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2005.02s)]
*  He also invented the tripod. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2006.2s)]
*  He was the first person to... [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2007.46s)]
*  These things that we just take for granted, like Joe, do you know that they didn't have [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2009.48s)]
*  clocks back then? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2012.02s)]
*  There was no clock. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2013.02s)]
*  They had sundials, right? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2014.02s)]
*  They had sundials, but what are you going to do at night? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2015.02s)]
*  What was the first clock? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2018.02s)]
*  So Galileo tried to invent the first clock. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2019.3s)]
*  It was actually part of a precursor to the Nobel Prize. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2021.22s)]
*  It was something called the Longitude Prize. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2024.46s)]
*  They offered a prize. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2026.26s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever done any boating or whatever, but when you're out on the ocean, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2027.8999999999999s)]
*  it's extremely hard to determine what your longitude is. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2031.6599999999999s)]
*  It's easy to find your latitude. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2034.98s)]
*  You just look for Polaris, the North Star. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2036.4199999999998s)]
*  You measure your elevation, and that's going to complement where you are latitudinally [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2038.54s)]
*  on the axis going from South Pole to North Pole on the Earth. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2041.74s)]
*  It was impossible to tell where you are East to West from the Prime Meridian unless you [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2046.4599999999998s)]
*  had an accurate way of measuring time. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2050.98s)]
*  So Galileo was one of the first people to try to compete to win this prize, which was [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2053.8199999999997s)]
*  worth like a million dollars back then in those days. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2058.98s)]
*  And he tried a couple different ways to invent timepieces, but the one that he tried to settle [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2062.66s)]
*  on was this use of the planet Jupiter's moons. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2068.06s)]
*  Jupiter has four moons. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2073.3s)]
*  I came for that look, Joe. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2076.3s)]
*  I came for that look. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2077.46s)]
*  I finally got it. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2078.46s)]
*  I can die happy. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2079.46s)]
*  I got the look. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2080.46s)]
*  Jupiter has four moons, and you can see them with this telescope. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2081.46s)]
*  And I'm going to give this as a gift to you for your birthday. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2085.1000000000004s)]
*  That little tiny one? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2086.9s)]
*  You can see it, yeah. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2087.9s)]
*  If Jupiter's out, you know where to look, and you kind of use a little bit of creative [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2088.9s)]
*  ... [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2091.78s)]
*  How much power is that one? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2092.78s)]
*  This one's about 12, 15 power. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2093.78s)]
*  So you could do it with 15 binoculars? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2095.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2097.1800000000003s)]
*  Easily. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2098.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2099.1800000000003s)]
*  You'll see what you'll see. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2100.1800000000003s)]
*  A tripod? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2101.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm wondering if, Jamie, if you could find ... [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2102.18s)]
*  I'm trying to find something that wasn't great. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2104.4199999999996s)]
*  If you look up Starry Messenger, Starry Messenger, Galileo sketch Jupiter. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2106.58s)]
*  So what Galileo did is he turned the telescope to the moon in 1609, and then in 1610, there [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2116.62s)]
*  they are, Jamie, on the right with those stars. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2123.94s)]
*  Look at that illustration of Galileo. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2126.8199999999997s)]
*  That's his handwritten. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2128.8199999999997s)]
*  I've seen a friend of mine owns this copy, a first edition of these books, and you're [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2130.1s)]
*  looking at it and actually ... [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2134.38s)]
*  A first edition? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2135.38s)]
*  The actual copy that he wrote on? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2136.38s)]
*  Not only that, yeah, the first edition, but it has his handwriting on it in pencil. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2138.02s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2141.7s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2142.7s)]
*  Oh my God, that's got to be worth a billion dollars. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2143.7s)]
*  Jamie, could you please go back to that, those illustrations? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2145.2599999999998s)]
*  I had that, this thing. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2147.98s)]
*  That's the handwritten stuff? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2148.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2149.98s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2150.98s)]
*  I couldn't tell what this was, that's why I didn't want to bring it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2151.98s)]
*  Man, imagine having a piece of paper that that guy wrote on. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2153.98s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2157.22s)]
*  This is a depiction of him showing ... Galileo's the guy with the beard looking down like Andrew [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2159.22s)]
*  Huberman at the guy with the white beard. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2164.3799999999997s)]
*  He does look like Andrew Huberman. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2166.8599999999997s)]
*  Look at that beautiful chiseled beard. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2167.8599999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2169.8599999999997s)]
*  Muscular. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2170.8599999999997s)]
*  He's showing these Venetian senators in Doge, because they were in charge of the military [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2171.8599999999997s)]
*  budget. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2176.8999999999996s)]
*  Even back then, there was a scientific military connection that he realized, because Galileo [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2177.8999999999996s)]
*  was kind of a cad. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2183.8199999999997s)]
*  He had a bunch of mistresses, he had some illegitimate children. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2185.34s)]
*  How dare you, Galileo. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2189.3s)]
*  He had to support his ... How dare you not be pure. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2190.3s)]
*  He had to support his brother, who's kind of a no-good-nik. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2193.1000000000004s)]
*  But anyway, the sketches in the lower right show the planet as you will see it with this [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2197.3s)]
*  telescope. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2201.98s)]
*  I'll let you know when it comes out. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2202.98s)]
*  Those four little dots, there was an image a couple of pages back, Jamie, that showed [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2204.6200000000003s)]
*  the planet as a disk, and then there are four stars. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2209.98s)]
*  If you go back one, I'll point it out to you. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2213.18s)]
*  Yeah, see that thing in the lower right, Jamie? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2215.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a Pinterest thing. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2218.02s)]
*  I don't know if that's a ... Yeah, click on that. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2219.02s)]
*  Here's a couple of ... See, it says January ... It's hard to say. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2222.06s)]
*  It's January 1610. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2224.4199999999996s)]
*  That's Galileo's handwriting. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2226.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2227.62s)]
*  And Ionis is like Jupiter. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2228.62s)]
*  He had shit handwriting. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2229.62s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2230.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2231.62s)]
*  I always thought people back then just wrote perfectly with feathers. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2232.62s)]
*  Who knew how to read it? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2236.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2237.14s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2238.14s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2239.14s)]
*  He's got like a doctor's handwriting. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2241.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2242.74s)]
*  So this is his first major book. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2243.74s)]
*  In the upper left, you see the sketch of the moon with these giant craters on it. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2245.8199999999997s)]
*  That crater ... Over there, Jamie? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2250.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2251.8599999999997s)]
*  So if you go back ... Yeah, click on it. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2252.8599999999997s)]
*  So click on that, Jamie. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2253.8599999999997s)]
*  That's his sketch? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2254.8599999999997s)]
*  That's his sketch of the moon through this telescope, essentially. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2255.8599999999997s)]
*  Now the interesting thing is, see that big crater? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2258.2599999999998s)]
*  That doesn't exist. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2260.54s)]
*  Really? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2261.54s)]
*  That does not exist. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2262.54s)]
*  The one on the top? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2263.54s)]
*  No, the one on the bottom. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2264.54s)]
*  That one? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2265.54s)]
*  Doesn't exist. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2266.54s)]
*  Doesn't exist. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2267.54s)]
*  Now why is it there? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2268.54s)]
*  He was a smart guy. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2269.54s)]
*  He was an artist, too, by the way. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2270.54s)]
*  So Gensou was a beautiful musician, a well-known musician. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2271.54s)]
*  He was a sketch ... I mean, that's hand-drawn sketches. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2274.14s)]
*  Why did he put that there? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2276.2599999999998s)]
*  Because Joe. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2278.18s)]
*  He wanted to convey not only what it looked like, but how it felt. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2279.7s)]
*  He was conveying. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2286.18s)]
*  And when you see it, you'll feel like it's that big, but if you actually measure it, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2287.18s)]
*  it's about 10 times smaller than that. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2289.94s)]
*  Oh, so he just made it larger than it really is. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2291.58s)]
*  To emphasize it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2294.38s)]
*  And what's so cool about that, if you want to know ... You've had on my friend, Sean [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2295.38s)]
*  Caroline, you talked about the Higgs boson when he was on the first time. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2300.22s)]
*  If you want to feel what it was like to discover the Higgs boson, you need 10 to 20 billion [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2304.3399999999997s)]
*  euros and you need a Large Hadron Collider. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2309.58s)]
*  Okay, good luck. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2311.58s)]
*  I don't know if Spotify is going to hook you up there. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2312.58s)]
*  But the feeling that Galileo had, you can have that tonight. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2317.66s)]
*  You can feel what it's like to see things for the first time in human history, because [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2321.04s)]
*  it's your own history. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2325.74s)]
*  You're experiencing it for the first time. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2327.4199999999996s)]
*  There's no other scientific tool, nothing. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2329.2599999999998s)]
*  Even the microscope, it's not the same viscerally. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2331.2599999999998s)]
*  You will be connected to Galileo. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2334.58s)]
*  400 years ago, feeling ... He was terrified. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2336.8599999999997s)]
*  When he saw those pictures of those dots, he realized what he was looking at was not [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2340.4599999999996s)]
*  just like some stars that happened to be next to Jupiter. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2344.14s)]
*  He realized he discovered another solar system, a system in which there was a massive gravitating [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2347.3799999999997s)]
*  object, Jupiter, and around it were orbiting satellites, were orbiting moons around it. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2352.9399999999996s)]
*  Today they're called the Galilean satellites. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2358.54s)]
*  He actually named them after his benefactor, those patrons, the Medici's, who were the [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2360.54s)]
*  richest people in that part of northern Italy. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2364.7400000000002s)]
*  So he was clever, right? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2367.54s)]
*  He was trying to curry favor with them. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2369.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2370.9s)]
*  It would be like if we named the Higgs boson, we named that after the European equivalent [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2371.9s)]
*  of the IRS, right? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2379.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2380.5s)]
*  He was kind of a kiss-off, it's always a sick off fan. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2381.5s)]
*  But it had to save his life and he needed money and so forth. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2384.1400000000003s)]
*  But when he drew that, he realized, wait a second, the Bible and all teaching heretofore [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2387.22s)]
*  said there is only one center to the solar system and it's the Earth, not the sun. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2392.6s)]
*  This is called geocentrism. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2398.64s)]
*  Everybody believed that, Aristotle, Plato, everybody had believed that for a long time [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2400.8799999999997s)]
*  because it said it was natural that heavy things should fall towards a center and the [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2405.8199999999997s)]
*  center that everything seemed to fall towards was the center of the Earth or the Earth itself. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2410.58s)]
*  Therefore the Earth must be the center of the universe. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2415.1s)]
*  Remember, the solar system was the universe for a long time, then for an equally long [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2417.14s)]
*  time almost, the galaxy was the whole universe and now there's the universe and maybe the [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2420.74s)]
*  multiverse that we'll talk about. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2426.22s)]
*  So this was just incredible realization to him. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2428.74s)]
*  Imagine like you come upon this thing and you realize you're the first person in human [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2431.58s)]
*  history ever to feel that. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2435.2999999999997s)]
*  Is there any documentation of his struggle with trying to convey these ideas to people [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2437.06s)]
*  that had very strong religious beliefs? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2443.94s)]
*  Because obviously it turned out to be a catastrophe for him. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2447.1s)]
*  But did he convey in his writing the frustration that he had? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2451.46s)]
*  He was such a fascinating person. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2457.46s)]
*  I always make a provocative statement that we don't need English departments, we should [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2459.2999999999997s)]
*  just teach physics and astronomy because some of the great scientists of history, men and [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2462.98s)]
*  women were tremendous orators, they were tremendous writers and they could convey things through [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2468.3399999999997s)]
*  the written word that was pure artistry and mastery. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2474.3s)]
*  And Galileo would say things like, I do not believe that the same God who has given us [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2477.5s)]
*  senses to understand the world would require that we not use that, and I'm butchering the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2481.7400000000002s)]
*  quote, not use them in order to better understand it. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2487.1400000000003s)]
*  He would write things that he had discovered things only as a way to open a portal into [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2490.0200000000004s)]
*  the universe such that minds more astute than mine may be able to walk through this portal. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2497.5400000000004s)]
*  And he was being a little falsely humble. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2504.22s)]
*  But Newton was the same way. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2507.2999999999997s)]
*  Newton would write as a great orator. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2508.54s)]
*  So you can learn a lot from scientific writing. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2510.18s)]
*  So therefore, if you only had to choose one thing, I would take the books of Galileo. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2512.7s)]
*  And this geocentric version of the universe that they've, how is it written in the Bible? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2516.4199999999996s)]
*  How do they describe? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2523.02s)]
*  It's actually, the atheist, so I call myself a practicing agnostic, which I can define [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2524.98s)]
*  later if you like. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2531.86s)]
*  But you had on my friend Stephen C. Meyer, which is partially the reason that I'm here, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2532.86s)]
*  I think. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2535.74s)]
*  But to have the discussion about the influence of religion on science. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2536.98s)]
*  And he made the claim that without religion, we wouldn't have science on the show a couple [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2541.7799999999997s)]
*  weeks ago. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2545.1s)]
*  In other words, we wouldn't have the tradition that we can, that the world is intelligible. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2546.1s)]
*  It's not the capricious will of gods playing with human beings as Greeks and others had [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2549.82s)]
*  identified. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2554.94s)]
*  So the notion of how religious a scientist could be or how religion impacted him was [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2557.34s)]
*  very clear. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2563.98s)]
*  He would say he was a very religious person. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2564.98s)]
*  In fact, two of his daughters were nuns. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2566.82s)]
*  Because of his, I always say, imagine we're living in a time where someone like Anthony [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2570.06s)]
*  Fauci or Francis Collins or somebody, that they were not only the scientists, the expert [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2575.66s)]
*  scientists say, but they also control the government. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2582.26s)]
*  In other words, the most powerful force on earth at that time, at least where Galileo [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2585.7000000000003s)]
*  was, was the Vatican. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2588.7000000000003s)]
*  He never left Italy. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2590.38s)]
*  He never left, Italy didn't exist back then, by the way. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2591.38s)]
*  They were only city states, right? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2594.02s)]
*  Tuscany and Venice and Rome and so forth. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2595.9s)]
*  But the notion, it was a Catholic, you know, band of jurisdiction and Catholic Church had [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2598.86s)]
*  sway over that part of Italy and Tuscany where he was. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2602.7000000000003s)]
*  He was very religious. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2606.1600000000003s)]
*  But he thought that he could say things like, if he proved that something scientifically [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2608.0800000000004s)]
*  was true, he didn't understand why that couldn't be part of the religious canon. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2613.94s)]
*  So he was surprised. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2620.06s)]
*  In other words, he felt that the signature of God is truth. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2621.06s)]
*  So if he discovered truth, it wouldn't be a problem for the, it would be threatening. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2625.06s)]
*  But I argue back then, it was kind of threatening. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2629.06s)]
*  Like if you started having a bunch of people say, oh, the Bible's wrong, we've been misled [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2632.32s)]
*  and they're the government, not just scientific authority, they're the government. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2636.62s)]
*  It could lead, I'm not saying it's good, but it could lead them to want to suppress that, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2641.16s)]
*  right? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2645.2999999999997s)]
*  Because it could lead to insurrections, it could lead to whatever and rebellions. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2646.2999999999997s)]
*  And that could be perceived as very threatening to the state. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2650.3399999999997s)]
*  But to answer your question, the Bible doesn't say anything about geocentrism. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2652.66s)]
*  There are passages in the Bible, there's two famous ones. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2657.2999999999997s)]
*  The most famous one is that Joshua in the Battle of Jericho, he caused the son to stand [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2659.2599999999998s)]
*  still. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2665.62s)]
*  And that to many people implies that the sun was orbiting around the earth. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2668.18s)]
*  It certainly could be construed that way. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2672.7999999999997s)]
*  But to answer your question, there is no real cosmology. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2676.3999999999996s)]
*  I always say, let me ask you, I don't know how much, I know you've had some exposure [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2678.44s)]
*  to Christianity, but I don't know how much you've ever read of the Old Testament, the [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2683.08s)]
*  Hebrew Bible, but the beginning of Genesis, right? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2687.7599999999998s)]
*  So I know that you're interested in origin stories, right? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2691.3999999999996s)]
*  So why is it that a book about a nomadic band of Bronze Age peasants, why does it begin [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2694.6s)]
*  with the creation of the world, of the universe? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2702.14s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2705.74s)]
*  Shouldn't it be like, there's something really delicious that you're going to want to eat, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2707.24s)]
*  it's called a pig, don't eat, why doesn't it start with that? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2710.58s)]
*  Why does it start with the origin of the universe? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2715.08s)]
*  Well, isn't that the ultimate question that man would have? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2716.7s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2721.36s)]
*  I think another way to interpret it is, if God created the universe, then it's kind of [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2722.36s)]
*  like he has title to everything, right? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2727.0s)]
*  He then could make a claim that, look, there's no God above me. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2729.36s)]
*  And think about the milieu that the Hebrew Bible came about in. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2732.88s)]
*  It was pantheistic. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2738.52s)]
*  It was in direct contradistinction to the other great religion of the time, which was [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2739.94s)]
*  necropolism, which was basically Egypt. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2744.2000000000003s)]
*  Egypt was a culture fixated on death, the pyramids, giant tombs, they had mummifications [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2747.76s)]
*  preserved into the afterlife, they named everything after themselves, they had statues. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2754.6400000000003s)]
*  Their Bible was called the Book of the Dead. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2760.5200000000004s)]
*  In other words, in contradistinction to the Jewish Bible, the Torah is like the Book of [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2763.36s)]
*  Life, we call it. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2767.8s)]
*  So Judaism's operating under that, where there were gods and the gods were within nature [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2770.1200000000003s)]
*  and they controlled man. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2775.1200000000003s)]
*  The Hebrew Bible was meant to show that no, God is above nature and controls nature. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2776.8s)]
*  Therefore, the sun, everything was weird that the sun is created on the fourth day. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2782.2400000000002s)]
*  In the Genesis description, the sun doesn't come about until the fourth day. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2787.36s)]
*  What's the day? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2791.36s)]
*  What's first? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2792.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2793.36s)]
*  Let there be light. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2794.36s)]
*  Let there be light from what? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2795.36s)]
*  From creation ex milio. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2796.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2797.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2798.36s)]
*  The multiverse. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2799.36s)]
*  If it's not from the sun, there is no light. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2800.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2802.2400000000002s)]
*  So what planets are we talking about? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2803.2400000000002s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2804.2400000000002s)]
*  But getting back to the original question, Galileo was very religious. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2805.68s)]
*  But where does it say in the Bible that the earth is the center of everything? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2809.24s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2814.7999999999997s)]
*  What ended up happening was the reason it was dangerous for him and he was accused of [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2816.8399999999997s)]
*  apostasy was because he was claiming against the doctrine of effectively of Aristotle. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2821.14s)]
*  And actually Stephen Meyer taught this to me in a conference that I went to with him last [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2828.9799999999996s)]
*  year in just a conversation. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2833.12s)]
*  I was wondering, why is it that the Catholic Church, Catholicism branches Christianity, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2835.44s)]
*  which came from Judaism, right? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2842.24s)]
*  I mean, the origin of they accept the Hebrew Bible, right? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2844.0s)]
*  So why is it that a sect of the or say the scientific and technological elite of the [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2848.04s)]
*  Catholic Church, why did they want to support a doctrine which really traced itself back [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2856.4s)]
*  to Aristotle? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2861.4s)]
*  The Aristotelian notion was that everything was centered on the earth. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2862.92s)]
*  There's nothing in the Bible that says the earth is the center of the solar system or [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2867.6800000000003s)]
*  doesn't say that. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2870.8s)]
*  But Aristotle made such logical sense to the Christians, to the early Christians and later [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2872.2000000000003s)]
*  to the Catholic Church, that they basically sanctified and made Aristotle effectively [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2877.2000000000003s)]
*  into a saint. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2882.36s)]
*  And so therefore it was blasphemy for Galileo to contradict Aristotle. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2884.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2889.6s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2892.02s)]
*  It's really strange because, you know, Aristotle was a pagan, right? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2893.9s)]
*  He was pantheistic, which is the number one law of the Ten Commandments, right? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2898.2599999999998s)]
*  Is I am the Lord your Eshav, no other gods before me. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2902.74s)]
*  Meaning that Judaism came to destroy pantheism and to accept monotheism and establish it [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2905.38s)]
*  throughout the world. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2911.2599999999998s)]
*  And now three billion people are affiliated with it in some way, right? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2912.2599999999998s)]
*  So that was its key enemy. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2915.64s)]
*  And so if you, we didn't have a sun god. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2917.78s)]
*  That's why if God creates the sun, God Hashem or, you know, the god of Allah or whatever, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2919.9s)]
*  that is more powerful than the sun. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2926.02s)]
*  So it supersedes it. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2928.14s)]
*  God controls the sun to do things for us and the moon to do things for us, for our benefit, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2929.5s)]
*  not for us to worship. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2935.0s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2937.1800000000003s)]
*  The question Aristotle became blasphemy and that's the idea of the geocentric universe. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2938.1800000000003s)]
*  Wow, that's amazing. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2945.38s)]
*  It's really amazing. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2948.62s)]
*  Because didn't they recognize that in Galileo, they had essentially someone like Aristotle, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2950.66s)]
*  a very unique mind that shapes its generation and many generations to come right in front [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2958.22s)]
*  of them. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2964.18s)]
*  And like, no, you're committing blasphemy for being brilliant. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2965.18s)]
*  And you know what's amazing? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2967.7799999999997s)]
*  Galileo has never been pardoned formally by the Catholic Church. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2968.7799999999997s)]
*  Pope John Paul, who's either... [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2973.5s)]
*  We really don't want to get into that. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2974.7799999999997s)]
*  Catholic Churches. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2977.1s)]
*  But that's part of the reason I became an astronomer. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2978.1s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2980.94s)]
*  Yeah, Galileo was my hero. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2981.94s)]
*  I got a telescope. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2983.54s)]
*  So I was born Jewish. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2984.54s)]
*  Both my parents are Jewish, were Jewish, my father passed away. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2985.54s)]
*  But my... [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2988.9s)]
*  They're both biologically Jewish. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2989.9s)]
*  When I was seven, my father abandoned me and my older brother, Kevin, and he started a [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2992.22s)]
*  new life. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2997.58s)]
*  And my mother remarried an Irish Catholic man by the name of Ray Keating. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=2998.58s)]
*  And he was very devout Catholic. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3002.94s)]
*  He's still alive, thankfully, and he lives on the East Coast. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3004.7999999999997s)]
*  And his family was 10 brothers and sisters. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3008.96s)]
*  And they welcomed me into their home, and my older brother, Kevin, with such love and [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3013.56s)]
*  graciousness and just touching humility and this big Irish Catholic family. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3018.72s)]
*  They basically would call... [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3024.4s)]
*  They thought that we became their biological grandchildren, cousins, nephews, and so forth. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3026.08s)]
*  Okay, I'm still close with them. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3030.96s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3031.96s)]
*  And I became so overawed by it. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3033.48s)]
*  And in contradistinction to that, anything I remember about Judaism from age zero to [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3035.72s)]
*  seven was just like, okay, well, you have to not eat once you can't eat that tasty [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3040.32s)]
*  bacon. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3045.32s)]
*  It was all things you can't do and so forth, right? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3046.32s)]
*  So this was like Christmas, Easter, hanging out, just boisterous 50 cousins at Christmas. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3048.8s)]
*  So I became, at the traditional age that a Jewish boy starts learning for his bar mitzvah [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3055.12s)]
*  at age 12, I became an altar boy in the Catholic Church in Chappaqua, New York. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3060.12s)]
*  And the exact same time, I was saving up money to buy my first telescope. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3067.56s)]
*  Because one night I had fallen asleep and I woke up in the middle of the night and outside [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3073.5s)]
*  the window, I saw this huge bright light and I didn't think there was a street light out [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3078.2799999999997s)]
*  there in the middle of summer looking at it. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3085.24s)]
*  And I was like, wait, that's the moon. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3087.5s)]
*  There was something next to the moon that was like, it looked like a little fragment [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3089.72s)]
*  of the moon had broken off and it was just like to the left of it. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3092.64s)]
*  It was as bright as the moon but much, much smaller. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3095.0s)]
*  And I was like, what the hell? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3097.7599999999998s)]
*  And this is in 1986, right? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3098.7599999999998s)]
*  There's no Google. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3099.7599999999998s)]
*  There's no, and I remember like what it was like before the internet. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3100.7599999999998s)]
*  So I was like, what the hell is that thing? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3104.48s)]
*  And I had to wait until Sunday, the New York Times used to print a section called Cosmos. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3107.5s)]
*  And in Cosmos, they would say like, what's happening in the skies? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3113.0s)]
*  There's going to be this, there's that, you know, it's the first phase of the moon. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3115.0s)]
*  And it showed a picture of the moon and some stars and like a map like this, but for stars. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3118.2s)]
*  And there was a thing next to it that said Jupiter. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3123.9199999999996s)]
*  I was like, what the hell? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3126.8399999999997s)]
*  Like I saw a planet. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3129.0s)]
*  Like I didn't know you could see a planet without a like Hubble Space, you know, whatever [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3130.8799999999997s)]
*  or without a satellite. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3134.3599999999997s)]
*  And so I just got really interested and I kept watching them night after night. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3136.62s)]
*  And I was unknowingly and I always joke, I have a pretty big ego, but I'm not going to [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3140.08s)]
*  compare myself to Galileo. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3144.12s)]
*  Indirectly, I kept doing the things that Galileo had done, like seeing, oh wait, the moon has [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3145.52s)]
*  craters on it. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3149.84s)]
*  Oh wait, the moon has mountains on it. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3150.84s)]
*  And maybe I could measure the height of those mountains from the size of the shadow and [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3152.6400000000003s)]
*  knowing the distance to the moon. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3155.96s)]
*  And the planet Jupiter has these four little dots around it and they would change their [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3158.6400000000003s)]
*  position night to night. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3162.36s)]
*  And like a lesser intellect like mine, you know, not intelligent at the time, looking [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3164.36s)]
*  at it would have just said, oh, the Jupiter is just next to some stars and it's going [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3168.44s)]
*  to move tomorrow, be different. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3172.28s)]
*  But no, those were Galileo realized he was looking at a mini solar system edge on. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3173.68s)]
*  He was looking like if you looked at above, he'd see these four moons going around like [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3178.72s)]
*  this, but he was looking at it like this. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3181.68s)]
*  So they were kind of going like this back and forth and it was periodic and he kept [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3183.8s)]
*  doing it for night after night after night. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3187.08s)]
*  And it kind of got boring in his book, the Sidereus Nuncius, which is otherwise an amazing [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3190.12s)]
*  book. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3194.0s)]
*  But when you look at it, he realized, hey, it's so periodic, I could use it as a clock. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3195.0s)]
*  So he tried to win this prize to invent the first stable, accurate clock that could be [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3201.2s)]
*  used by mariners on the ocean surface, far from land to determine the time difference [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3205.56s)]
*  between them and Greenwich, therefore determining their longitude. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3210.2999999999997s)]
*  And what's the mechanism that he proposed to try to measure these planets going around? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3214.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3218.72s)]
*  So if you just plotted their distance over enough time, it was periodic. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3219.72s)]
*  So you could just calculate it just like the moon. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3222.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3224.96s)]
*  But I mean, in terms of like the actual mechanical clock itself, what was he? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3225.96s)]
*  Is it just a calculated clock on paper? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3230.1200000000003s)]
*  You'd look up in a table like a database. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3232.84s)]
*  He would have it printed forever. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3235.52s)]
*  But you'd still need to see the planet's moon surrounding it. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3237.76s)]
*  So he built, like basically it was the first virtual reality helmet. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3241.28s)]
*  It's called like a cell phone or something. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3245.0s)]
*  So it was actually a helmet that you'd put on and then it had these two short versions [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3248.98s)]
*  of his telescopes on his eyes. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3253.36s)]
*  And then like you'd go on the ship and they'll be moving around like this and you try to [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3255.56s)]
*  It failed. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3259.12s)]
*  He didn't win it. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3260.12s)]
*  And it would probably make you like totally nauseous. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3261.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3264.16s)]
*  So you were wearing a helmet with telescopes at night on the ocean. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3265.16s)]
*  And then you're supposed to stare up at Jupiter and count. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3268.56s)]
*  Like I don't understand what it is. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3273.16s)]
*  You just look at the positions and then that's the thing. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3274.16s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3276.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3277.16s)]
*  Set alone. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3278.16s)]
*  Thank you, Jamie. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3279.16s)]
*  That looks so crazy. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3280.16s)]
*  I saw that in the battlefield. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3281.16s)]
*  I'd run like they have evil weapons. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3282.16s)]
*  They have satanic weapons. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3283.16s)]
*  And then first of all, you can't see them. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3285.24s)]
*  You can't see Jupiter for part of the year when it's behind the sun. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3286.84s)]
*  So that's useless. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3289.36s)]
*  It's got a candle on it. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3290.36s)]
*  It's got a candle. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3291.36s)]
*  Oh my God, it's hilarious. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3292.36s)]
*  They didn't have clocks. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3293.36s)]
*  Forget about lights. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3294.36s)]
*  So when was the first mechanical clock? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3295.36s)]
*  So the first mechanical clocks were developed I think in Switzerland and in Northern Europe, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3296.36s)]
*  Germany and Switzerland. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3305.6400000000003s)]
*  There were windups and springs and so forth. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3306.6400000000003s)]
*  First pendulum clocks. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3310.1200000000003s)]
*  And what year was that around? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3311.1200000000003s)]
*  This was in the early 1700s. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3312.1200000000003s)]
*  So it was finally won, I believe. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3314.08s)]
*  The Longitude Prize was won in the mid 1700s. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3315.48s)]
*  But actually Galileo tried to do this from his youth. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3319.24s)]
*  He would be in church and I remember even though I was an altar boy and I loved it, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3322.7799999999997s)]
*  I had good experiences in the Catholic Church even though I abandoned it later on as I'll [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3326.44s)]
*  describe. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3330.52s)]
*  But one day Galileo was in church and the priest was giving some boring sermon and Galileo [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3333.52s)]
*  was just sitting there like this. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3340.04s)]
*  And he looked up and there was a lantern and like some horse cart had gone through or whatever [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3342.4s)]
*  and the lantern was going back and forth like a pendulum. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3346.44s)]
*  And Galileo put his fingers on his pulse and he timed the period of the pendulum and he [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3350.1600000000003s)]
*  realized it didn't change. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3357.44s)]
*  It was constant. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3359.28s)]
*  And no matter what he would use for the pendulum, as long as it had the same length, it would [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3360.28s)]
*  have the same period. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3365.0s)]
*  So all the lanterns with the same length chain, all the chandeliers, they were all having [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3366.62s)]
*  the same periods. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3373.22s)]
*  But those of a shorter one would go back and forth faster. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3374.52s)]
*  So he discovered the law of pendulums and he was like five years old. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3376.8599999999997s)]
*  Like those old grandfather clocks. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3380.2999999999997s)]
*  My grandpa's parents used to have one of those. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3381.7799999999997s)]
*  It would swing. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3383.46s)]
*  It had this brass thing. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3384.46s)]
*  There it is. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3385.46s)]
*  It would swing. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3386.46s)]
*  Yep. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3387.46s)]
*  So they have all these things. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3388.46s)]
*  He invented the first thermometers. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3389.46s)]
*  Jamie, if you want to look up Galileo's thermometer. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3390.46s)]
*  How did they discern the amount of minutes in an hour, the amount of hours in a day? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3393.7s)]
*  So to get to a level of precision now, or then to a few minutes or fraction of a day, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3398.8199999999997s)]
*  that was easily significant enough to make measurements of longitudes. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3405.7s)]
*  So the actual level of precision, that didn't occur until the 1800s to get really good clocks. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3409.48s)]
*  And now I talk to people, Bill Phillips on my podcast, the Nobel Laureate, at NIST, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3415.52s)]
*  the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland, and they are making clocks that [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3421.34s)]
*  are accurate to one part in a thousand trillionth of a second. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3425.34s)]
*  This thing will not lose time over the age of the universe. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3432.02s)]
*  And this is a mechanical clock? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3434.02s)]
*  This is what's called an atomic clock. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3435.54s)]
*  Atomic clock. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3437.1400000000003s)]
*  It's optical lattices and they cool things down to almost absolute zero. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3438.1400000000003s)]
*  But the reason is the earth used to be, the earth was the first clock, right? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3441.7400000000002s)]
*  The earth turns around once per day, right? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3444.94s)]
*  The Babylonians decided that they'd like to do it in units of 60, even though we have [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3447.8999999999996s)]
*  ten fingers and toes. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3451.66s)]
*  They did it in fractions of 60, 60 minutes, 60 seconds, 3,600 seconds in an hour. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3453.46s)]
*  Right, but why did they do that? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3457.98s)]
*  That's your game. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3460.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't know why they think about these things. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3462.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, 60 has a lot of divisors, and so it's convenient. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3464.66s)]
*  It's divisible by 15, 12, 10, 5, 6. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3467.8599999999997s)]
*  I wonder if there was an argument. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3469.58s)]
*  I mean, when they first decided, okay, right now it's one o'clock. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3471.14s)]
*  It starts right now. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3475.02s)]
*  How do you start the day? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3476.58s)]
*  How do you decide? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3477.78s)]
*  It's fascinating that the whole world has adopted this system, essentially, other than [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3478.78s)]
*  military, which uses a 24-hour system. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3483.02s)]
*  When you think about that the whole world just decides, okay, we're all going to agree. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3486.02s)]
*  And then some places are like, fuck you at daylight savings. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3491.66s)]
*  We're not playing that game. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3494.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3495.66s)]
*  Like Arizona. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3496.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3497.66s)]
*  There's a few places like that, right? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3498.66s)]
*  Like Arizona doesn't do anything all year. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3499.66s)]
*  They don't play that game. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3500.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3501.66s)]
*  They're like, fuck off with your fucking pretend clocks. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3502.66s)]
*  We do things our way up here. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3503.66s)]
*  And then obviously there's time zones. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3505.2999999999997s)]
*  With traveling, the way we do now, it's so fascinating because you could literally fly [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3509.54s)]
*  somewhere and it's a 10-hour difference in time zones. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3512.8199999999997s)]
*  Or like Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3515.02s)]
*  It's half hours. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3516.94s)]
*  Got half-hour time zones out there. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3517.94s)]
*  So all this is bringing up a notion what's called calibration. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3520.2999999999997s)]
*  So I'm an experimental physicist. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3522.8599999999997s)]
*  The hardest thing about doing a measurement for me is not knowing what I measure. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3524.74s)]
*  It's knowing how I screwed up the measurement. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3528.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like, what went wrong? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3530.62s)]
*  How do I know? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3531.8999999999996s)]
*  How do I know what the base level zero point is of this measurement? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3532.98s)]
*  What's the calibration? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3536.34s)]
*  When you buy this cup of coffee, when you buy the black rifle, are they on it or whatever, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3537.54s)]
*  how do you know you're getting exactly what they say? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3541.86s)]
*  Just print it on there, right? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3544.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3545.14s)]
*  So I'll ask you. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3546.14s)]
*  You're one of the owners, right? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3547.14s)]
*  So how do you ensure that? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3548.14s)]
*  Have you ever thought about that? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3549.14s)]
*  Do you go in and count all the items? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3550.5s)]
*  No, we had issues with that in the past. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3551.6600000000003s)]
*  How so? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3553.46s)]
*  When we first started the company, well, we were getting stuff made in these places that [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3554.46s)]
*  do supplements. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3559.78s)]
*  And so we were third party testing our stuff and finding things in our supplements that [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3561.2999999999997s)]
*  weren't supposed to be in there, like different vitamins. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3564.98s)]
*  Like, why is that in there? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3566.8199999999997s)]
*  And then trace amounts. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3568.3799999999997s)]
*  And it turns out it's contamination. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3569.3799999999997s)]
*  And that's a lot of athletes actually get popped from small levels of steroids that [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3571.4199999999996s)]
*  are in like protein powders and creatines and things that they buy from kind of shady [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3577.2599999999998s)]
*  organizations. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3583.66s)]
*  Yeah, my man Fernando Tatis. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3584.66s)]
*  He got nailed for that last year, right? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3585.66s)]
*  What does he do? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3587.8999999999996s)]
*  San Diego Padres right fielder now is there. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3589.06s)]
*  There's a lot of claims that people get popped for that. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3591.78s)]
*  Like Canelo said he had tainted meat from tacos. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3595.98s)]
*  Oh, they just have enough steroids in them. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3598.34s)]
*  And you look jacked as fuck. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3600.86s)]
*  Okay, bro. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3602.98s)]
*  Settle down, sir. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3603.98s)]
*  Do steroids work if you're not like going to the gym? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3606.1s)]
*  I mean, no, no, they do not. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3609.14s)]
*  But for athletes, they have a significant advantage and they allow you to recover much [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3610.86s)]
*  quicker. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3614.54s)]
*  You know, it's there's certain sports. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3615.54s)]
*  Well, if you go bodybuilding a sport, right? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3618.14s)]
*  It's impossible. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3620.2599999999998s)]
*  It's impossible without steroids. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3621.2599999999998s)]
*  Some of these guys are just you cannot get to that size. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3622.74s)]
*  You don't get to Ronnie Coleman size. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3625.54s)]
*  You don't get to like Dorian Yates size. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3627.1s)]
*  You don't get there without my mother-in-law size. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3628.7799999999997s)]
*  My mother-in-law tragically, she lost her. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3630.66s)]
*  What would have been my oldest brother-in-law when he was about 16 years old. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3634.7s)]
*  My wife sold this brother and she dedicated her life to just like just being the best [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3638.98s)]
*  person she could be. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3644.14s)]
*  She entered. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3645.18s)]
*  She built her body up. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3646.18s)]
*  I'm like emotional thinking about it because I love her so much. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3647.18s)]
*  And she she built her body and she did this as like a Jewish grandmother, you know, basically. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3651.1s)]
*  And she's totally ripped. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3656.5s)]
*  I mean, she's still in great shape. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3657.98s)]
*  But this is like 10 or 15 years ago, maybe 20 years ago. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3659.22s)]
*  And I used to joke when I was dating my wife, Sarah, I was like, you know, normally, like [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3662.62s)]
*  take a girl out, you know, scared of her father. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3665.7s)]
*  Like I'm terrified of your mother. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3668.18s)]
*  My ass. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3669.9s)]
*  But like she never used to. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3671.14s)]
*  I mean, she's you know, it's not her way anyway. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3672.14s)]
*  You can get cut, I think you can get like low body fat without taking legal stuff, probably. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3674.7000000000003s)]
*  But you probably can't get the musculature is what you're saying. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3680.3s)]
*  Oh, you can get very big without taking steroids. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3682.42s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are massive without taking steroids. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3684.94s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have fantastic genetics. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3687.62s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have just thick, heavy builds. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3690.54s)]
*  You know, it's natural. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3693.98s)]
*  There's many, many people like that. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3695.98s)]
*  But to get to the size of a bodybuilder is superhuman. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3698.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not possible without steroids. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3702.74s)]
*  That is a science project. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3704.74s)]
*  When you look at these people that have just traps that start at the top of their ears [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3706.2599999999998s)]
*  and boulders for sure, bowling ball shoulders, that is that's not possible. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3711.66s)]
*  I've met many people that are really fit and look fucking huge and they don't do steroids. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3717.86s)]
*  There's a lot in the UFC. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3724.38s)]
*  The UFC, you saw the test everybody. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3726.06s)]
*  So they'll show up at your house at 630 in the morning. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3728.02s)]
*  Wake up, sir. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3731.06s)]
*  We need a urine test and we need a blood sample. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3732.54s)]
*  And they do that all the time. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3735.1s)]
*  And these jacked people don't get caught. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3737.1s)]
*  They're either they're doing it so sophisticated that even with USADA, which is the most sophisticated [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3741.1s)]
*  anti-doping program that we have available and very invasive, right? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3745.94s)]
*  Because it does. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3749.62s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3750.62s)]
*  Like it wakes guys up on weigh-in days and shit like that. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3751.62s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3753.94s)]
*  And they're trying to not to do that now. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3754.94s)]
*  But you have to make sure that it's completely right. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3756.22s)]
*  Like you can catch them. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3758.94s)]
*  So there's some short acting testosterone supplements that you can take that particularly [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3760.46s)]
*  now apparently there's some new ones that they leave the body in like two and a half [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3765.78s)]
*  hours. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3771.62s)]
*  So you can take them and get an elevated level of testosterone. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3772.6600000000003s)]
*  You could take them multiple times a day and it doesn't affect your natural testosterone [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3776.38s)]
*  production. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3780.38s)]
*  And it also doesn't show up if you get past that two and a half hour window. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3781.38s)]
*  So there could be a lot of people who are just rolling the dice. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3786.46s)]
*  I see. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3789.1400000000003s)]
*  How do the weigh-ins work? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3790.3799999999997s)]
*  Because one of the things I was going to mention is, you know, when you weigh something, what [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3791.3799999999997s)]
*  are you comparing it against? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3796.46s)]
*  The weigh-ins are sanctioned cheating. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3797.62s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3800.1s)]
*  It is 100% sanctioned legal cheating. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3801.1s)]
*  It's more than fasting. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3804.54s)]
*  They use very sophisticated methods. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3806.22s)]
*  This guy, Sugar Sean O'Malley, who just won the Bannon weight title. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3809.74s)]
*  Dan Gardner is his nutritionist. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3813.06s)]
*  I was actually just going back and forth with him on Instagram because I watched one of [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3816.22s)]
*  the videos that he did and I was like, that is really impressive stuff. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3820.7s)]
*  Dan Gardner is Dan, what is his profile here? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3827.3s)]
*  I think it's Dan Gardner nutrition. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3831.34s)]
*  And yeah, G-A-R-N-E-R. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3834.58s)]
*  So he's, they're detailing how they cut weight. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3838.66s)]
*  And one of the things they do is they eliminate carbs like very close out and they do all [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3843.06s)]
*  these different things to water load so your body gets used to like dumping water out a [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3848.66s)]
*  lot. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3853.02s)]
*  There's like, it's very sophisticated. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3854.02s)]
*  So when a guy weighs in, in this case, Sugar Sean weighted at 135 pounds. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3855.42s)]
*  He's 135 pounds for all of like an hour or so. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3861.34s)]
*  And then he weighs in and when he fights, he'll be in the 150s. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3864.94s)]
*  He'll be somewhere in the 150s. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3867.7s)]
*  And that's mild. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3869.34s)]
*  His opponent, Al Jermain Sterling, is absolutely massive for the weight class. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3870.58s)]
*  So Al Jermain, even though he weighs in at 135 pounds, he's walking around. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3874.94s)]
*  I've seen him walk around in the 170s. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3879.42s)]
*  Wow, 135 is my birth weight. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3881.42s)]
*  He's a big, well, he's not that small. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3883.86s)]
*  When you stand next to him, like there's, show an image of me standing next to him when [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3885.98s)]
*  I was interviewing him. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3891.06s)]
*  He's fucking shredded. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3892.14s)]
*  There's no way that guy's 135 pounds. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3893.66s)]
*  I mean, 135 pound person is a fairly small man. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3895.66s)]
*  This guy's fucking jacked. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3899.46s)]
*  And so it's a magic trick. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3901.94s)]
*  The best at it is this guy, Alex Paheda. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3903.5s)]
*  Alex Paheda, who was the middleweight champion, he weighs in at 185 pounds. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3906.26s)]
*  He fights at 220 plus. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3911.7400000000002s)]
*  He's so massive. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3914.94s)]
*  Like you cannot believe. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3916.9s)]
*  Okay, so that's him on the weigh in day. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3918.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay, it's not him weighing in though. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3924.14s)]
*  So he's significantly rehydrated by that point. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3926.34s)]
*  Is there an image of me interviewing him at the post fight? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3929.98s)]
*  Is there a technique to put on weight health like safely before a fight? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3933.5s)]
*  Like there's just drinking. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3937.34s)]
*  It's not safe. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3938.5s)]
*  It's not safe. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3939.5s)]
*  It's very bad. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3940.5s)]
*  These guys are compromised. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3941.5s)]
*  Yes, a hundred percent. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3942.5s)]
*  It's very bad for your organs. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3943.6600000000003s)]
*  It's very bad for your body. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3945.02s)]
*  But okay, so that's him. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3946.1000000000004s)]
*  So look at that. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3947.34s)]
*  That's 135 pounds. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3948.6200000000003s)]
*  How the fuck? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3950.34s)]
*  I weigh 200. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3951.34s)]
*  So look at me next to him. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3952.42s)]
*  He's fucking gigantic. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3953.86s)]
*  And I think he's if not the best weight cutter in the sport, him and Paheda, they're in the [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3956.1400000000003s)]
*  running for it because Paheda now show Alex Paheda. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3960.42s)]
*  This fucking guy. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3964.7400000000002s)]
*  This guy you can't you can't when he weighs in. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3966.3s)]
*  I don't see the actual weigh in. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3969.1800000000003s)]
*  I go there for the ceremonial weigh in. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3971.1800000000003s)]
*  And he's already put on probably 10 pounds of water by time. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3972.78s)]
*  So he'll weigh in first thing in the morning. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3975.58s)]
*  And then by the time that's him right there. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3977.44s)]
*  Click on that link right there with me, me standing next to him. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3979.58s)]
*  The one that you just had with his flexing upper right hand corner of the. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3983.06s)]
*  Yeah, that that one. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3986.7799999999997s)]
*  So that's him weighing in. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3988.06s)]
*  And his cheeks are sucked in and he'll gain literally 40 pounds almost between them and [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3989.86s)]
*  Fight Night. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3998.2999999999997s)]
*  It's fucking bananas. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=3999.38s)]
*  We did a study I think in the 80s with Olympic hopefuls and they said they made the following [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4000.38s)]
*  test of sprinters. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4006.2599999999998s)]
*  Would you would you trade the following a gold medal guaranteed gold medal at the next [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4008.26s)]
*  games if it meant you die at age 35? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4013.6600000000003s)]
*  They also yes. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4016.9s)]
*  They also like half of them said yes. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4017.9s)]
*  The other ones are losers. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4020.1400000000003s)]
*  But I thought about in the context of the Nobel Prize, you know, it's like how many [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4021.1400000000003s)]
*  scientists have have these things because what are these Joe? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4026.78s)]
*  These are we call them like we don't think about idol worship. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4030.34s)]
*  Have you ever been tempted to bow down to an idol, Joe? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4034.24s)]
*  I mean, not recently. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4037.3599999999997s)]
*  No, we have different idols, right? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4038.48s)]
*  There's different things that we aspire to. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4040.3599999999997s)]
*  But but even people that aren't like in the religious sect think of themselves as atheists, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4042.56s)]
*  let alone agnostic. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4047.44s)]
*  But our atheists, they all have religions. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4048.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4051.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think for some of these guys, yeah, I mean, if it's sacrificing your lifespan, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4051.68s)]
*  your health span, whatever Peter or Tia would talk about, what what is what's it worth? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4056.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, is that high worth it? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4061.56s)]
*  Like to be champion for a day? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4063.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4065.32s)]
*  Like, can you name like Olympic sprinter from the 1980s? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4065.56s)]
*  You know, besides like Flo Joe and I mean, there are a couple, but I don't think she said [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4069.48s)]
*  that she would trade it. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4073.08s)]
*  But I mean, it's so transitory and it's so it's so applicable only to the small cadre [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4073.84s)]
*  of people within your technical network. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4078.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4081.36s)]
*  Like the Nobel. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4081.88s)]
*  Like you can't probably name more than you've had a couple of Nobel Prize winners on the [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4082.44s)]
*  show. But can you name more? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4085.96s)]
*  No, because you're not. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4088.12s)]
*  I can name every one of them. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4088.92s)]
*  I could name Ben Rose. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4090.2s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4092.04s)]
*  Yeah. You know, one bit. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4092.56s)]
*  But you're also the very few people that get to interview people like him on a daily basis. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4093.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a god to them. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4098.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4099.68s)]
*  It's it's this thing that very few people achieve. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4100.04s)]
*  Well, when you get this, when you win it, I mean, I won a Nobel Prize. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4104.16s)]
*  I mean, my book is called Losing the Nobel Prize, my first book. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4106.92s)]
*  And spoiler alert, you know, I didn't win the Nobel Prize. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4109.68s)]
*  But that's what it looks like. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4112.4800000000005s)]
*  That's that's a chocolate replica. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4114.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know you won't eat that. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4115.96s)]
*  And I hope you don't. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4117.2s)]
*  I'll eat it. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4117.84s)]
*  It's 15 years old. Be careful. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4118.599999999999s)]
*  Why? I think it's bad. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4120.36s)]
*  What happens to chocolate? Would you eat it? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4121.679999999999s)]
*  It would be a shame if I ate it because it's old. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4123.36s)]
*  Isn't that interesting? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4125.4s)]
*  Like if you found old candy and it's still edible, like, why did you eat it? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4126.5199999999995s)]
*  It's from the 1800s. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4129.88s)]
*  Honey is fucking candy. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4131.5199999999995s)]
*  Honey lasts forever. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4132.72s)]
*  You can write in the Egyptian. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4133.8s)]
*  Isn't that bizarre? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4135.28s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4136.08s)]
*  Well, that's the only substance that's that's made by an insect, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4136.76s)]
*  which is you're not allowed to eat insects and kosher Jewish people aren't allowed to eat. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4141.72s)]
*  But it's something made by a non kosher animal that you're allowed to eat. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4145.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's kosher. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4149.5199999999995s)]
*  We can eat honey even though it's made from like you can't drink pig's milk, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4150.44s)]
*  like because it's made from a pig. Right. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4153.96s)]
*  But but look at this thing. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4156.04s)]
*  So so the second commandment talks about not making graven images. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4157.08s)]
*  Or maybe it's the third. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4161.96s)]
*  When you win a Nobel Prize. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4163.48s)]
*  So my very close friend and mentor, Barry Barish, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4164.759999999999s)]
*  he won the 2017 Nobel Prize for discovering gravitational weight. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4167.599999999999s)]
*  He'd be an amazing guest for you, by the way. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4171.08s)]
*  If I can have the temerity to even make such suggestions. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4173.16s)]
*  But he invented or co-invented the LIGO experiment, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4176.64s)]
*  which was this experiment, one branch of its in Louisiana and one's in Washington state. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4179.72s)]
*  One point two billion years ago in a galaxy, we have no idea where it is to this day. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4185.32s)]
*  Two black holes were orbiting around each other, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4190.24s)]
*  just like Roger Penrose had predicted. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4193.8s)]
*  And they came together and each one was about 30 times. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4195.72s)]
*  One was 30 times the mass of the sun. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4199.599999999999s)]
*  One was 32 times the mass of the sun. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4201.48s)]
*  They combined. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4203.719999999999s)]
*  They made a giant black hole even bigger, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4205.12s)]
*  but it only had the mass of, say, 60 times the mass of the sun. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4207.719999999999s)]
*  So like two masses worth of the sun vanished. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4211.24s)]
*  And it didn't produce light because they're black holes. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4215.08s)]
*  And the energy supplied by them did not go anywhere else [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4217.5599999999995s)]
*  except into making what are called gravitational waves, waves in the fabric of space time, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4221.08s)]
*  such that if one were coming through this room right now, I mean, you couldn't notice it. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4227.32s)]
*  But technically, it would make your weight go up and down like these guys on the way in would love it. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4231.28s)]
*  It would make it go up and down, except it would take, you know, a couple of hundred days [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4235.8s)]
*  for it to even change by a billionth of a percent. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4239.679999999999s)]
*  But it changes your physical manifestation of gravity. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4242.04s)]
*  It gives you anti-gravity for a second and then a lot many seconds and longer. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4245.36s)]
*  It makes you heavier, lighter. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4249.16s)]
*  That's what a wave of gravity is. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4250.679999999999s)]
*  It's distorting the feel and force of gravity. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4252.48s)]
*  Well, these two black holes coalesced. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4255.88s)]
*  And one or two sun's masses of these black holes was converted into shaking up space time itself. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4258.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4267.28s)]
*  Then these waves of gravity propagated from somewhere. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4268.4800000000005s)]
*  We don't know exactly where in the universe it was. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4271.28s)]
*  They came to the Earth. It took 1.2 billion years to get to the Earth. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4273.64s)]
*  One instrument in Hanford, Washington state, and one instrument in Louisiana. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4277.360000000001s)]
*  They registered the same event, the same exact signal, but separated by the speed of light [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4283.4s)]
*  divided into the distance. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4290.2s)]
*  In other words, these waves of gravity were traveling at the speed of light, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4291.36s)]
*  shaking up and exactly consistent with the merger of two smaller black holes into one enormous black hole. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4294.4s)]
*  Okay, so when Barry and his team, Ray Weiss and Kip Thorne, they won the Nobel Prize for this. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4300.88s)]
*  I interviewed 15 Nobel... [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4305.719999999999s)]
*  On Thursday I'm interviewing my 15th Nobel Prize winner. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4307.719999999999s)]
*  But I've interviewed 14 of them so far on my podcast. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4311.08s)]
*  And we all, at the end of each podcast, I always ask them the same question. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4315.08s)]
*  It's related to the name of the podcast called Into the Impossible. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4318.84s)]
*  It's a quote from Sir Arthur C. Clarke. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4322.32s)]
*  Arthur C. Clarke said, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4324.6s)]
*  The only way of determining the limits of what's possible is to go beyond it into the impossible. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4325.48s)]
*  I always say to each guest, I say at the end, it's kind of like my wrap up, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4330.68s)]
*  you know, what advice would you give yourself as a 20 year old to give you the courage to do as you've done [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4333.48s)]
*  to go into the impossible? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4338.24s)]
*  And I asked Barry Barra, she's 80 years old. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4340.12s)]
*  I said, Barry, what would you do? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4341.96s)]
*  He said, I would make sure to tell my 20 year old self to get over the imposter syndrome [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4343.72s)]
*  because I still haven't gotten over it. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4349.96s)]
*  So what the hell are you talking about? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4352.44s)]
*  You won the freaking Nobel Prize. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4354.04s)]
*  You're among, like, there's more people in the NBA right now, Joe, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4356.08s)]
*  than won the Nobel Prize in physics that are alive. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4359.68s)]
*  Okay, it's a very small group of people. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4362.5199999999995s)]
*  At most, three people can win it every year. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4364.88s)]
*  They typically win it when they're in their 70s and 80s, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4367.24s)]
*  so their life expectancy isn't super long. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4369.5199999999995s)]
*  Sir Roger's 92 now. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4371.12s)]
*  But when you win it, I said, how could you possibly have the imposter syndrome, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4372.88s)]
*  this fear of inadequacy that you don't belong where you're at, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4379.0s)]
*  that you don't deserve the accolades that you've had? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4381.88s)]
*  You won it. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4384.0s)]
*  It was selected by 400 nerds in Sweden that said you were good enough to win the Nobel Prize. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4384.48s)]
*  How could you? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4389.0s)]
*  He said, no, Brian, when you win a Nobel Prize, you get the golden medal, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4389.679999999999s)]
*  like flavor flavor, you know, you put it on. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4394.12s)]
*  And you get the million dollars or your portion of the million dollar purse. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4396.8s)]
*  But they also want to make sure that you received it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4400.5199999999995s)]
*  You're not going to come back later and say, where's my Nobel Prize? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4403.5199999999995s)]
*  So they make you sign a ledger. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4405.84s)]
*  They make you sign, like, remember those old fashioned autograph books? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4408.44s)]
*  And they make you sign it. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4412.64s)]
*  And he said, Barry told me, he said, I'm a curious guy. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4413.92s)]
*  So what do I do? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4416.72s)]
*  I look, you know, who won it last year? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4417.88s)]
*  I saw some of my friends and advisors maybe. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4419.24s)]
*  Richard Feynman, wow, that's pretty cool. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4421.4s)]
*  Marie Curie, Albert Einstein. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4423.16s)]
*  His actual signature in this book, because it's only been around for [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4425.96s)]
*  116 years or something like that. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4429.68s)]
*  So there are a lot there, you know, goes back to Einstein and he won in 1922. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4432.32s)]
*  When he saw Einstein, he said, I am not worthy. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4437.08s)]
*  I'm just some humble kid from Nebraska. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4440.4s)]
*  I don't belong here. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4442.84s)]
*  How can I possibly be in the same book as Albert Einstein? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4444.36s)]
*  And I said, Barry, I've got good news and I've got good news. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4448.0s)]
*  I said, did you know that Albert Einstein felt the imposter syndrome? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4452.68s)]
*  He's like, you're kidding me. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4457.0s)]
*  How could that possibly be? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4457.96s)]
*  I said, no, Barry, he did. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4460.160000000001s)]
*  I looked up this quote and I showed it to him. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4461.92s)]
*  I said, Albert Einstein called Isaac Newton not only the greatest scientist in [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4463.8s)]
*  history, but the man who single-handedly changed Western civilization more than [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4468.68s)]
*  any other person through the Principia and the study of natural determinism and laws. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4473.8s)]
*  And I said, but wait, there's more. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4479.68s)]
*  He said, Newton had the imposter syndrome. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4481.76s)]
*  He said, you're kidding me, Newton. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4485.2s)]
*  He was like, because Newton was kind of a prick. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  Newton had a huge ego. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4488.52s)]
*  He was not kind to his friends. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4489.8s)]
*  He tortured people as the master of the mint or he had them tortured. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4491.4400000000005s)]
*  Tortured people? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4494.88s)]
*  Yeah, he was like- [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4495.64s)]
*  Physically tortured people? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4496.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, not him. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4497.72s)]
*  Push that microphone so it's like in your face. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4499.2s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4501.84s)]
*  Yeah, you take a podcaster. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4503.04s)]
*  He tortured people? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4504.56s)]
*  He was responsible. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4505.88s)]
*  He was like the execute, he was responsible for the equivalent of the IRS in England. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4507.12s)]
*  So people would cheat. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4513.32s)]
*  They would scrape down pennies. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4514.32s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4515.32s)]
*  I've read this. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4516.32s)]
*  He was the master of the mint, it was called. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4517.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4518.32s)]
*  I forgot about this. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4519.32s)]
*  He was also an alchemist. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4520.32s)]
*  He was an amazing guy, but he was kind of a prick. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4521.32s)]
*  And he had imposter syndrome as well. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4523.64s)]
*  So he had imposter syndrome. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4525.5199999999995s)]
*  Who could he have imposter syndrome about? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4526.8s)]
*  You might wonder. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4528.68s)]
*  And if you read his writings, do you know what Isaac Newton, the creator of calculus, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4530.28s)]
*  first person to understand universal gravitation, discovered laws of optics. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4534.88s)]
*  Do you know what his biggest accomplishment according to him was? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4539.0s)]
*  He died a virgin. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4544.08s)]
*  Yeah, that was a weird one, right? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4545.08s)]
*  I was going to bring that up. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4546.8s)]
*  He was celibate. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4548.12s)]
*  You know why? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4549.12s)]
*  Why? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4550.12s)]
*  Because there's only one way that he could emulate his hero, the person before whom he [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4551.12s)]
*  felt the imposter syndrome. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4557.44s)]
*  And who was that? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4559.48s)]
*  That was Jesus Christ. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4560.48s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4561.48s)]
*  So he wanted to be Christ-like. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4562.6s)]
*  He wanted to emulate Christ. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4564.4400000000005s)]
*  And the only way he could do it, he couldn't like fast or, I don't know, he couldn't walk [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4566.360000000001s)]
*  on water. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4569.68s)]
*  He couldn't turn water into water. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4570.68s)]
*  He couldn't turn loaves into fishes or whatever Jesus also did. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4572.52s)]
*  But he could die celibate. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4575.72s)]
*  And that's who he had imposter syndrome. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4577.72s)]
*  But the lesson is... [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4579.56s)]
*  Is this from his writing that he spoke of this? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4581.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4583.320000000001s)]
*  Are you sure he just didn't, it was like an excuse for he didn't like sex? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4584.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4587.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, it sounds nutty. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4588.120000000001s)]
*  How do you figure that out when you're like 14, 15 years old? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4589.8s)]
*  You know, you're young and full of hormones and you've made this decision to be like Jesus? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4593.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4598.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4599.32s)]
*  No, it's... [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4600.32s)]
*  He was a strange guy. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4601.32s)]
*  He sounds insane. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4602.32s)]
*  He definitely was. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4603.32s)]
*  He was not like Galileo. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4604.32s)]
*  You would want to hang out with Galileo. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4605.32s)]
*  If you met Galileo... [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4606.32s)]
*  I'd probably want to hang out with him too. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4607.32s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4608.32s)]
*  For a little bit. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4609.32s)]
*  Just to see what it's like. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4610.32s)]
*  So when you win the Nobel Prize, you go there. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4611.32s)]
*  And what is the commandment about idol worship? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4613.12s)]
*  It's that you shall make no gilded, golden, graven, like engraved images. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4616.04s)]
*  So who is that? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4621.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you know who that is? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4622.5199999999995s)]
*  Albert Nobel. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4623.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's Alfred Nobel. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4624.5199999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4625.5199999999995s)]
*  Alfred. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4626.5199999999995s)]
*  And you know, he invented dynamite and he also died... [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4627.5199999999995s)]
*  He died never having been married. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4629.24s)]
*  I don't know if he was celibate or not. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4630.72s)]
*  Hala. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4632.72s)]
*  So he was never married. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4633.72s)]
*  But he established this... [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4635.56s)]
*  When you win it, you literally, the King of Sweden comes up to you and you must bow down [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4637.56s)]
*  to him. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4642.2s)]
*  And he puts the gilded, graven image on your head. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4643.28s)]
*  So for all the trappings and all the 90% of National Academy members who do not believe [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4646.24s)]
*  actively profess a belief in God, this can become at some level a religion. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4650.8s)]
*  And it's a kosher one. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4656.24s)]
*  It's okay to worship. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4657.24s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4658.24s)]
*  Well, the unattainable for... [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4659.24s)]
*  That's maybe perhaps attainable to a very select few is always the thing that people [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4661.2s)]
*  are chasing after, especially like high achievers. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4665.84s)]
*  But many, many that I know that get there do have imposter syndrome, including MMA world [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4668.68s)]
*  champions. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4674.72s)]
*  Like, some of them, they get there like, this isn't real. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4675.72s)]
*  This can't be real. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4678.04s)]
*  I can't be the man. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4679.04s)]
*  Because they've set this up their whole life. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4680.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4681.04s)]
*  And also, look, you can get to the promised land, but you can't stay in it. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4682.04s)]
*  How many baseball teams have won the World Series year after year forever? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4685.76s)]
*  I mean, even the Yankees haven't done that. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4689.4800000000005s)]
*  Even your bow socks haven't done that, right? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4691.280000000001s)]
*  They're not mine. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4693.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4694.280000000001s)]
*  But for me as a young kid, this is what I aspire... [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4695.52s)]
*  And actually as an adult, I wanted to win this basically at all costs. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4698.8s)]
*  This became my... [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4702.820000000001s)]
*  But it was acceptable because people told me, like, if you discover these waves of gravity [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4704.72s)]
*  manifest in the cosmic background radiation that I study, you're guaranteed to win the [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4709.96s)]
*  Nobel Prize. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4714.400000000001s)]
*  And for me, it was... [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4715.52s)]
*  I don't know about you with your relations with your father, but I had a very difficult [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4717.76s)]
*  relationship with my father. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4722.88s)]
*  And in it, it was really predicated the way that some kids would get into fights or with [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4725.5199999999995s)]
*  their father, or maybe they would try to be a better football player than their dad or [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4730.36s)]
*  whatever. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4734.639999999999s)]
*  My father was a great scientist and mathematician. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4735.639999999999s)]
*  And the one prize he never won was the Nobel Prize. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4738.28s)]
*  And so after he abandoned us, this became kind of the way that I could supersede him. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4742.96s)]
*  And it became an obsession to me, as well as being scientifically interesting to be [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4748.599999999999s)]
*  a part of. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4752.24s)]
*  There are very few projects that are eligible to win a Nobel Prize, let alone that can win [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4753.24s)]
*  it. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4756.599999999999s)]
*  But for me, it was kind of an added dimension that came with it. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4757.599999999999s)]
*  And that was, you know, like the normal kid might have it with sports and their dad or [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4761.36s)]
*  maybe the other way around with your... [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4765.32s)]
*  When you're a dad, you might treat your kids like that. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4766.68s)]
*  Like, oh, you think you could take me on or whatever. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4769.2s)]
*  And so for that, that was the main source of driving impetus for my personal quest to [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4772.599999999999s)]
*  get this particular idol in my life. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4778.24s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4781.08s)]
*  Are you aware of Ronald Mallet? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4782.08s)]
*  Do you know who he is? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4784.88s)]
*  He is... [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4786.92s)]
*  I believe he's out of the University of Connecticut. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4787.92s)]
*  He studies time travel. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4791.6s)]
*  And he became obsessed with time travel after his father died when he was a young boy, because [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4794.96s)]
*  he felt like if he worked hard enough, he could develop a time machine and go back and [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4799.48s)]
*  save his father. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4803.56s)]
*  It's literally a Spider-Man origin story. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4805.76s)]
*  That's exactly... [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4808.32s)]
*  This guy has been dedicated his life to finding a working model of a time machine. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4809.32s)]
*  And I think... [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4815.2s)]
*  Was it Kurt Godel? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4816.5199999999995s)]
*  How do you say his name? [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4818.679999999999s)]
*  Girdle. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4819.679999999999s)]
*  Girdle. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4820.679999999999s)]
*  It's that weird omelette. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4821.679999999999s)]
*  Omelette. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4822.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4823.679999999999s)]
*  How do you say it? [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4824.679999999999s)]
*  Girdle. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4825.679999999999s)]
*  Girdle. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4826.679999999999s)]
*  Girdle. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4827.679999999999s)]
*  It's like people that say Van Gogh. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4828.679999999999s)]
*  And now it's really Van Gogh. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4829.679999999999s)]
*  Excuse you. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4830.679999999999s)]
*  But he developed a working model, but it just required something like the size of the sword [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4831.679999999999s)]
*  system. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4839.28s)]
*  No, you're right. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4840.28s)]
*  I don't know how you know that. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4841.28s)]
*  But yeah, he had a spiraling, he had a rotating cosmos where you could have what are called [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4842.28s)]
*  world lines. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4845.24s)]
*  Just like you could walk around the surface of the earth and if you go in the same direction, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4846.8s)]
*  eventually you'll come back to where you started. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4849.5599999999995s)]
*  If the universe was somehow rotating in the way that he envisioned it, you could have [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4851.84s)]
*  it end up on a time start where you began from the beginning. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4855.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, see that travelers, time like curve. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4859.12s)]
*  Wild. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4862.719999999999s)]
*  Girdle is interesting because he and Einstein were buddies back at the Institute for Advanced [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4864.16s)]
*  Study like Oppenheimer. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4868.96s)]
*  I don't know if you saw Oppenheimer. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4869.96s)]
*  I haven't seen it yet. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4870.96s)]
*  You should see it. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4871.96s)]
*  I don't go to the movies. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4872.96s)]
*  I do go to the movies. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4873.96s)]
*  I saw Barbie. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4874.96s)]
*  Yeah, did you? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4875.96s)]

*  My girls are not old enough to drive you there. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4877.96s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4880.320000000001s)]
*  I want to say my friend Ben Shapiro, your former guest, he hated it. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4881.320000000001s)]
*  I don't understand Ben. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4884.88s)]
*  He needs to fucking have a sit down with me about this. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4885.88s)]
*  He needs to chill out about that. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4888.320000000001s)]
*  Maybe he'll come back. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4889.320000000001s)]
*  Everything's a goddamn culture war. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4890.320000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4892.0s)]
*  That's what I love about astronomy. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4893.0s)]
*  No one ever freaks up and says, see that comet over there? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4894.0s)]
*  That's a Republican. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4897.04s)]
*  There's a Democrat astronaut. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4898.04s)]
*  It's safe. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4901.04s)]
*  You're studying things that are so immense and so spectacular that it makes all this [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4902.88s)]
*  stuff seem like nonsense. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4909.68s)]
*  This stuff that people fill their days up with complaining about. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4911.08s)]
*  A fucking Barbie movie. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4914.92s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4917.08s)]
*  That would be like someone who's a pacifist reviewing the ultimate fighting championship. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4919.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4925.48s)]
*  And saying they hit each other too much. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4926.48s)]
*  That's what it's for. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4928.12s)]
*  There's a joke about Einstein goes to heaven and somebody comes up to him and says, oh, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4929.12s)]
*  you're Albert Einstein. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4934.32s)]
*  You're great. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4935.32s)]
*  I can't wait to talk to you. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4936.32s)]
*  So first you must tell me your IQ. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4937.32s)]
*  The guy goes, I have 140 IQ. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4941.44s)]
*  We could talk about the math and string theory and this and that. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4943.5599999999995s)]
*  And then another guy comes up, what's your IQ? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4947.04s)]
*  It's 130. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4948.76s)]
*  Oh, we could talk about the stock market and we can talk about all these financial district. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4949.76s)]
*  And then someone comes up, I have 100 IQ. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4956.08s)]
*  We could talk about culture wars. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4958.0s)]
*  I think it's more of a tribal thing than anything with us. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4964.28s)]
*  I think what's going on is just something that's written into the human reward system. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4967.76s)]
*  There's a lot of social value in being part of a tribe, as well as social value in being [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4974.52s)]
*  part of a committed ideology, whether it's a religion or a cult or politics. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4978.88s)]
*  That's what's impressive. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4983.92s)]
*  I mean, not to be too overbearingly appraise-worthy, but there's a Yiddish saying, if you stand [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4984.92s)]
*  in the middle of the road, you get hit from both sides of the street. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4991.4400000000005s)]
*  But you seem to defy that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4994.76s)]
*  It's always interesting to me if I talk to somebody, I talk to Noam Chomsky. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=4996.72s)]
*  I personally hate his politics or whatever, but if I'm talking about linguistics and aliens [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5002.2s)]
*  and communication, I'll talk to that. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5005.8s)]
*  But I talk to Ben Shapiro and people just go, could you possibly platform him? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5008.88s)]
*  That doesn't need Brian Keating's help to platform him. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5013.36s)]
*  That talk is nonsense. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5015.679999999999s)]
*  There's only one way to find the holes in someone. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5017.639999999999s)]
*  How many revealing interviews have you seen where people were supposedly platformed? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5019.92s)]
*  And in those conversations, you reveal the way that they look at the world is very flawed. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5024.72s)]
*  It's very easily pick a part of all. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5029.56s)]
*  You could just go through it and say, well, this is illogical. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5031.76s)]
*  This doesn't fit in with your whole philosophy of freedom. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5035.120000000001s)]
*  There's so many things that are inconsistent with the way you view this one thing. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5038.76s)]
*  Why do you view this one thing this way? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5042.72s)]
*  I think the human mind hates ambiguity. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5044.4400000000005s)]
*  No one would say you can abort a five-year-old. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5047.88s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5051.120000000001s)]
*  There are people. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5053.120000000001s)]
*  Anyway, I don't want to get into it. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5054.120000000001s)]
*  I'm sure there's a few persons out there. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5055.120000000001s)]
*  My dad used to say when I was 30, he's like, I believe in abortion up until the 33rd trimester. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5057.68s)]
*  But on the other hand, no one say like, before the parents meet, you can't have it. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5065.64s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5070.400000000001s)]
*  So there's clear-cut benefits to being polarized because it simplifies it, gives you a hack, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5071.64s)]
*  an algorithm. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5077.200000000001s)]
*  Say, I can easily say, well, you should not have an abortion. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5078.200000000001s)]
*  So therefore, I must be in the people that say you should never have it, or like gun [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5081.6s)]
*  control. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5084.16s)]
*  Should you have an AK-47? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5085.16s)]
*  Should you have a tow, a tank-operated weapon? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5087.24s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5089.599999999999s)]
*  Should you have a little boy? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5090.599999999999s)]
*  Well, you have a little boy, fat man. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5091.599999999999s)]
*  It's not of that kind, right? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5092.599999999999s)]
*  They're not that explosive. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5094.4s)]
*  But it's because human beings hate these Schrodinger kind of ambiguities. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5096.8s)]
*  They just hate them. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5099.8s)]
*  And so they must cleave to the direction that they understand. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5101.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5104.48s)]
*  It's a very unfortunate thing that doesn't get taught out of people. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5105.48s)]
*  Instead of that, we teach them to subscribe to whatever ideology the teacher is promoting. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5109.04s)]
*  And I think that's a real issue with people. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5116.4s)]
*  We need to give people the space to figure out things for themselves and decide how they [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5119.36s)]
*  view all these different subjects, not have this predetermined group of questions and [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5127.28s)]
*  answers that they're a part of the ideology. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5134.24s)]
*  You must subscribe to them wholeheartedly, wholesale. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5139.679999999999s)]
*  Apparently, so Lex mentioned that Andrew Huberman's Wikipedia page, because you platformed RF. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5143.24s)]
*  I'm like, the guy's a Kennedy. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5150.36s)]
*  OK, first of all, he's Democrat. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5151.84s)]
*  Well, this is all that happened. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5153.04s)]
*  Andrew Huberman commented on a post that I made about Robert Kennedy Jr. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5155.88s)]
*  He said, I think this is great. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5159.88s)]
*  I hope more presidential candidates do long-form podcasts. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5161.32s)]
*  That's it. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5165.0s)]
*  So Wikipedia removed the research section of his page. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5166.0s)]
*  He's got 70 published papers. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5170.76s)]
*  It's highly cited. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5174.320000000001s)]
*  He's very well-respected. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5175.76s)]
*  And they removed that because they had decided that they were going to, I don't know what [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5177.52s)]
*  their thought process was, what their motivation was, but it appears that what they're doing [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5182.040000000001s)]
*  is punishing him for what he said by labeling him in a very, they're maligning him in multiple [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5186.76s)]
*  different ways. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5193.200000000001s)]
*  I thought about saying, well, you know who else Joe Rogan had on this guy named Peter [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5194.200000000001s)]
*  Hotez? [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5196.88s)]
*  Yeah, well, I try to have a lot of people on. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5197.88s)]
*  But there's nothing wrong with having a guy who's running for president on a podcast to [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5200.64s)]
*  discuss things. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5205.5599999999995s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5206.5599999999995s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5208.32s)]
*  And the way they did that to Huberman when he was just saying that he hopes more presidential [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5210.12s)]
*  candidates do long-form podcasts. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5215.5199999999995s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5220.04s)]
*  That's tyrants do shit like that. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5222.5599999999995s)]
*  That's horrible. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5224.28s)]
*  If I could indulge your forbearance, because how often do I? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5225.32s)]
*  It's the first time I ever met you. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5229.759999999999s)]
*  But trying to study how to be a better podcaster, to be better at my microscopic emulation. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5231.4s)]
*  So I have on all different types of people. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5238.799999999999s)]
*  But sometimes I have on people. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5240.5599999999995s)]
*  And look, I'm a scientist. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5242.24s)]
*  I'm not a podcaster. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5243.599999999999s)]
*  I'm a tenured professor of physics at a major university. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5244.599999999999s)]
*  So it's not my data. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5248.12s)]
*  But nevertheless, I feel like I owe it to people to translate what my fellow scientists [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5249.16s)]
*  are doing into layman's terms that they can understand because they pay our freaking [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5253.44s)]
*  salaries. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5256.799999999999s)]
*  It's very valuable what you do. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5257.799999999999s)]
*  It's very valuable. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5259.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5260.0s)]
*  It means it's so important to have people do exactly what you just described. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5261.0s)]
*  Translate it to people that are not going to study it in any other way. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5264.679999999999s)]
*  And it's a very consumable way. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5266.96s)]
*  I get pushed back. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5268.44s)]
*  Very digestible. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5269.44s)]
*  I said like yesterday, a couple days ago, I said on Twitter, I said, why is it that [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5270.44s)]
*  there are science popularizers? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5275.24s)]
*  We don't have UFC popularizers. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5277.4s)]
*  We don't have movie popularizers. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5279.839999999999s)]
*  We don't have TikTok popularizers. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5281.5199999999995s)]
*  But we have this whole class of people called science popular. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5284.04s)]
*  And I'm all for I've had talked to Neil deGrasse Tyson, Mitch Yerkoff, talked to these people. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5286.5199999999995s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5290.0s)]
*  Maybe I do it at some level. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5291.0s)]
*  Brian Cox, Brian Green. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5292.0s)]
*  I'm the third Brian to come on the podcast as far as I know. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5293.0s)]
*  But the thing is, we as scientists have been given this incredible script, the script of [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5297.96s)]
*  nature or of God, if you will. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5303.719999999999s)]
*  We have this incredible present and we are so bad at communicating what we do. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5306.46s)]
*  And worse than that, we don't feel like it's our obligation. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5313.14s)]
*  I always joke and maybe it's not even a joke. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5316.82s)]
*  Scientists have a moral obligation to communicate what they do to the people that fund them. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5319.52s)]
*  But they also have, you know, just common sense. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5324.34s)]
*  If the public gets turned off to science because the scientists say, I am too specialized for [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5326.9800000000005s)]
*  you, Joe. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5332.6s)]
*  I can't break it down for an everyman to understand. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5333.6s)]
*  What I do is very, I should stay in the lab because we need people that just stay in the [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5335.98s)]
*  lab and don't get out. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5339.339999999999s)]
*  I always joke like, how do you know a scientist is outgoing? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5340.66s)]
*  Have you ever heard this one? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5343.259999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5344.5s)]
*  They look at your shoes when they talk to you. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5345.5s)]
*  That's very funny. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5348.5s)]
*  But if I don't teach my students these things, if I don't teach them, look, part of the soft [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5350.7s)]
*  skills that will get you farther in life and all the Nobel laureates that I've talked to, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5354.86s)]
*  they all have that in common. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5358.78s)]
*  They're not just awesome and the top elite killers of science, Joe. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5360.139999999999s)]
*  They're incredible communicators, persuaders, salesmen, saleswomen, because you don't just [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5364.48s)]
*  make a great idea and everyone accepts it. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5369.679999999999s)]
*  You have to convince people, editors, peer reviewers, funding agencies, and you're in [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5372.219999999999s)]
*  a complex battle against the world's other killers. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5377.16s)]
*  And what if you're just a little bit better than them? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5381.0s)]
*  Because you have learned that it's important for you to communicate to your bosses, to [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5383.839999999999s)]
*  your funding agents, such that we don't have this elite that the general public can't understand. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5388.16s)]
*  So they just defer to whichever way the wind's blowing and we have what we've had for the [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5393.48s)]
*  last few years. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5397.799999999999s)]
*  Well, don't you think that the reason why you have so many science influencers or science [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5398.799999999999s)]
*  educators is because science is way more complicated than all the other things? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5404.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know, is it? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5408.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5409.679999999999s)]
*  Of course it is. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5410.679999999999s)]
*  It is and it isn't. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5411.679999999999s)]
*  It is and isn't? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5412.679999999999s)]
*  Do you know the difference? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5413.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, I don't want to say it like that. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5414.679999999999s)]
*  I'm going to say there's a difference between complex and complicated. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5416.48s)]
*  So a complicated thing is building a 787 Dreamliner. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5420.64s)]
*  That's freaking complicated. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5425.08s)]
*  There's over 700 million parts to it. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5426.88s)]
*  There's a supply chain. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5429.8s)]
*  There's, you know, like, F that. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5430.8s)]
*  People don't know how to build a pencil. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5433.200000000001s)]
*  Like there's no one person that knows how to get the graphite and the wood and the eraser [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5434.56s)]
*  and the metal and the paint. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5439.360000000001s)]
*  There's no one person that has something as simple as a pencil could be considered complicated. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5440.96s)]
*  But complicated means if you follow it, my PhD thesis, if you follow it, you will build [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5446.2s)]
*  a polarimeter that's capable of measuring the cosmic microwave background's polarization. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5451.04s)]
*  Like there's just, it's just linear steps. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5455.12s)]
*  There's complexity. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5457.5599999999995s)]
*  Like if you try to make a sand pile and have exactly the same number of grains of sand, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5458.679999999999s)]
*  or if you want to have this particular thunderstorm that's brewing in the plains of Austin, Texas [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5464.16s)]
*  tonight, that is a complex system. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5468.4s)]
*  That is a system that is not capable of being described by a finite number of steps. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5471.68s)]
*  It may have properties. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5476.0s)]
*  It may have phases. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5477.0s)]
*  It may have building phase, dissipating phase, hail, whatever. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5478.0s)]
*  But it may have commonalities. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5481.72s)]
*  But like the butterfly effect, the flapping of the wind, you cannot replicate the sensitivity [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5483.200000000001s)]
*  to the initial conditions that then lead to a complex event. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5488.08s)]
*  Science can be both complicated and complex, but there's just no, there's no way around [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5491.56s)]
*  this. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5497.360000000001s)]
*  If you can't explain it to somebody who is not an expert, you've failed at a certain [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5498.4s)]
*  level. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5502.88s)]
*  Because just imagine if you were working like, do you think it's complicated to be an accountant [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5503.96s)]
*  at a top 10 accounting firm? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5509.48s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5511.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5512.12s)]
*  So imagine your boss, the CFO of that company comes and says, hey Joe Rogan, what you've [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5513.12s)]
*  been working on? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5516.799999999999s)]
*  You say, what I've been working on is very complicated. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5517.799999999999s)]
*  It's very sophisticated. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5521.5199999999995s)]
*  It's very complex. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5523.0s)]
*  It's very, you won't understand it. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5524.0s)]
*  That's the implication. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5526.0s)]
*  You're insulting the person. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5527.08s)]
*  I'm insulting the general public. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5528.76s)]
*  If I say, I can't explain to you why this is the frickin' absolute coolest thing in [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5530.88s)]
*  the world to do. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5535.44s)]
*  And if you didn't pay me, or Gavin Newsom, my boss, your former governor, if he didn't [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5536.6s)]
*  pay me to do it, Joe, I would do it for free. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5541.16s)]
*  In other words, we are so animated by it. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5543.32s)]
*  But why don't we do it? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5546.12s)]
*  Because actually it's the converse of what you said. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5547.44s)]
*  Communicating to the public is hard to scientists. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5550.44s)]
*  It's not the science that's hard to do. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5552.08s)]
*  It's to learn how to distill it and teach it to. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5554.48s)]
*  I've had over 2,000 students in my career. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5557.04s)]
*  I don't think I'm the best teacher, but I think I can do a good job enough to take somebody [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5560.12s)]
*  who was a lay person and now they're an expert. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5564.5599999999995s)]
*  And now they're teaching down the street from you here. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5567.12s)]
*  And they're much better and smarter than I am. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5570.28s)]
*  How did that happen? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5571.759999999999s)]
*  If I didn't dedicate some time to it. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5572.759999999999s)]
*  But what scientists will say is, no, I want to study wormholes. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5574.839999999999s)]
*  And it's not really that important. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5578.599999999999s)]
*  That's the subtext. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5580.759999999999s)]
*  Neil deGrasse Tyson, it's not that important. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5581.96s)]
*  What he's doing, he can't do real, this is the rap, I'm not saying I believe this, but [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5584.72s)]
*  this is the rap. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5588.68s)]
*  He is not a real scientist. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5590.32s)]
*  He won't say he is not doing research, he doesn't have students. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5592.16s)]
*  But he's not really a scientist the way that I, Brian Keating, am a scientist. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5595.0s)]
*  Because he's not actively in the trenches. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5599.84s)]
*  Because if he were, he wouldn't have time to go out. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5601.24s)]
*  That's BS. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5603.96s)]
*  I'm sorry, that's BS. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5604.96s)]
*  Well what I meant is that it's complicated to do in terms of expressing that to people. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5606.48s)]
*  And there's so many things to cover. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5613.08s)]
*  There's so many things. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5614.839999999999s)]
*  And you also have to captivate people's attention. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5615.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't think it's, and there's also various fields of science that you, I mean, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5618.48s)]
*  try explaining string theory to regular people. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5623.919999999999s)]
*  You can do it. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5627.28s)]
*  You can. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5628.28s)]
*  But I mean, it's very complicated, right? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5629.28s)]
*  You can do it. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5630.28s)]
*  Eric Weinstein can do that. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5631.28s)]
*  He can talk to people. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5632.28s)]
*  Oh, he'll put you in a coma. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5633.28s)]
*  He will put you in a coma. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5634.28s)]
*  I'll say, keep it simple for me. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5636.04s)]
*  Help me out. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5638.4400000000005s)]
*  And he'll, on purpose, just. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5639.4400000000005s)]
*  Well that's called the, that's a bias called the expert effect. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5641.6s)]
*  Like, you're so smart, you just don't realize what it was like. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5644.0s)]
*  Now, like, you can do things in the gym, I'm sure, like, you don't even know that you're [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5646.68s)]
*  doing them. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5649.6s)]
*  But to teach it to me would be impossible, right? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5650.6s)]
*  Because it's just like encoded and viscerally into your DNA by this point. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5651.6s)]
*  I think I can teach you. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5655.160000000001s)]
*  You can teach? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5657.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5658.280000000001s)]
*  If your body moves normal, I can teach you. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5659.280000000001s)]
*  I guess the thing is, people say, well no, that's really not my skill set to teach. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5661.320000000001s)]
*  In that sense. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5665.44s)]
*  By the way, I mean, half of our jobs as professors is supposed to be to teach, not just to raise [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5666.44s)]
*  money and do research. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5670.76s)]
*  Right? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5671.76s)]
*  So like, you'd think, well, you're a professor. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5672.76s)]
*  You are a science communicator, at least to a small class. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5674.88s)]
*  Basically, and if you're not, if you take your job seriously and you're not a schmuck [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5677.44s)]
*  and you think that I have integrity, I'm going to learn how to do that beyond. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5680.64s)]
*  Because what would happen if the public cut off science? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5684.72s)]
*  If they said, we don't, look what happened the last couple, you're like, we don't know [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5688.32s)]
*  who to believe. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5691.04s)]
*  We don't know where is the ground truth. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5692.04s)]
*  Who do we believe? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5693.4s)]
*  So we're going to defund science. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5695.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5696.240000000001s)]
*  We're going to defund science. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5697.240000000001s)]
*  So you're unemployed. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5698.240000000001s)]
*  By the way, I only have the job I have now and not like building some weapon because [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5699.240000000001s)]
*  we're not at war. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5702.4800000000005s)]
*  Right? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5703.4800000000005s)]
*  I think it's 60 years ago in Oppenheimer, you'll watch it. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5704.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, like they took the killers of science and they were all in the desert in Los Alamos [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5706.72s)]
*  and they were squirreled away and they didn't tell anybody. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5710.84s)]
*  And the same thing was going on in London and England and working on radar and the same [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5713.68s)]
*  thing was going on in MIT. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5717.52s)]
*  And it's just, we serve at the pleasure of the public as scientists. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5720.160000000001s)]
*  Too few of us realize this and too few of us view it as a moral obligation to communicate [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5723.5599999999995s)]
*  back to the public. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5727.88s)]
*  And so therefore we have this industry of science popularizers and some people make [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5728.88s)]
*  quite a good living at it. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5732.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5734.36s)]
*  Well, it's got more power to them. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5735.36s)]
*  It's great that people are interested in it now. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5736.679999999999s)]
*  And it's one of the things that I think podcasts like Lex Friedman's and many other ones that [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5738.92s)]
*  platform these people and have these discussions and it's like makes things digestible. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5744.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5748.32s)]
*  It's very important because it's very fascinating. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5749.32s)]
*  I wanted to bring this thing up before I forget. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5751.64s)]
*  Because we kind of skipped over it all. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5754.160000000001s)]
*  We talked about the web. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5755.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5756.56s)]
*  The web telescope. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5757.56s)]
*  How old is the universe? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5758.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5759.92s)]
*  So you had this tweet that took over the internet and Instagram posted. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5760.92s)]
*  Well, it was actually something that I had heard before that. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5764.4800000000005s)]
*  Someone was saying there was something like a quasar that they had discovered that seemed [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5767.64s)]
*  to be far older than it was supposed to be. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5771.280000000001s)]
*  So ever since the web telescope, the web telescope was launched on Christmas Day 2021 and it's [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5773.52s)]
*  been traveling out to a million miles past the Earth-Moon system. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5779.0s)]
*  It's about a million miles from the Earth. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5782.84s)]
*  And there it orbits. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5784.84s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5785.84s)]
*  It orbits around a blank piece of space that orbits around the Earth and the sun. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5786.84s)]
*  So it's a wild thing that was figured out a couple hundred years ago and is only possible [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5790.84s)]
*  to be used now. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5794.6s)]
*  But anyway, this orbit allows James Webb and its cameras to see things in what's called [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5795.84s)]
*  the infrared portion of the radio, infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5800.6s)]
*  So if you take another gift for Joe. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5805.74s)]
*  So these are called a diffraction grating. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5808.82s)]
*  So this is like a billion mini prisms. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5811.24s)]
*  I got one for Jamie too. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5813.0199999999995s)]
*  After the show, I'll give it to you. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5814.58s)]
*  So now if you hold this up to a source of white light, look at the source of white light [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5817.34s)]
*  above us. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5822.099999999999s)]
*  You see these beautiful rainbow halos, right? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5823.099999999999s)]
*  And it's almost a continuum. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5826.78s)]
*  In other words, you can't tell where the red leaves off. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5828.259999999999s)]
*  The orange begins. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5831.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, it's fuzzy, right? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5832.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't really tell. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5834.74s)]
*  Now look behind you at the Joe Rogan Experience neon light. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5835.74s)]
*  You'll basically just see the yellow. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5839.98s)]
*  You'll see the orange. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5842.62s)]
*  And that's because that's made of gases that only emit light at very, very narrow wavelengths, [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5844.0599999999995s)]
*  very, very small wavelengths. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5850.219999999999s)]
*  So you don't see the halo of a pure rainbow around the, say the O. You see a couple of [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5852.54s)]
*  colors but you don't see the continuous. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5857.94s)]
*  See how it kind of breaks apart? [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5859.44s)]
*  Or here's another example, Joe. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5860.74s)]
*  I'll put this on the wall. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5862.38s)]
*  This is a laser spot. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5863.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5865.259999999999s)]
*  So now look at this through there. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5866.259999999999s)]
*  What do you see? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5867.74s)]
*  I can't see it. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5868.74s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5869.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5870.74s)]
*  I see a bunch of them. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5871.74s)]
*  You just see a bunch of green dots. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5872.74s)]
*  Yeah, they're everywhere. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5873.74s)]
*  But now if I do this, here's a white light. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5874.74s)]
*  I'll do it. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5876.38s)]
*  I'll point it right. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5877.38s)]
*  I don't want to blind you. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5878.38s)]
*  But here, look at me. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5879.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5880.38s)]
*  And look at that light. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5881.38s)]
*  Oh, pretty. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5882.38s)]
*  Now you see the rainbow, right? [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5883.38s)]
*  Isn't that cool? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5884.38s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5885.38s)]
*  That's cool, right? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5886.38s)]
*  That's really pretty. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5887.38s)]
*  So this diffraction grating separates light out into all of its different wavelengths. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5888.38s)]
*  It's called the spectrometer. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5893.0599999999995s)]
*  It's dispersing it according to its color. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5894.26s)]
*  Now Isaac Newton and William Herschel figured out something really cool. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5896.820000000001s)]
*  They said, if I believe if I look at a light source like the sun or something like that, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5900.62s)]
*  and I block off all the light, here's the red lights on this, going to be on this side. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5905.7s)]
*  If I put a thermometer, imagine you put a thermometer like right here, the thermometer [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5910.54s)]
*  would register 70 degrees or whatever it is in this room. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5915.22s)]
*  If you go outside and the sun's out, it will, and the sunlight's not directly hitting the [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5917.9400000000005s)]
*  and you put it where the red comes out over here, it starts to heat up. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5924.62s)]
*  The thermometer gets warmer. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5928.54s)]
*  And they realized there's light that you cannot see beyond the red that's responsible for [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5930.54s)]
*  the perception of heat. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5935.179999999999s)]
*  That's heat. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5937.0199999999995s)]
*  That's called infrared radiation. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5938.0199999999995s)]
*  If you keep going in this direction, if such a thing were possible, you eventually get [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5940.139999999999s)]
*  to microwaves, which is what I study. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5943.62s)]
*  Those are wavelengths of about a millimeter to three or four millimeters in wavelength. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5946.179999999999s)]
*  Visible life is visible light's 500 millionths of a meter. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5950.46s)]
*  It's incredibly small. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5953.66s)]
*  Then there's infrared, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5955.1s)]
*  Then finally there's radio waves way off over there that you can't see with something like [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5957.46s)]
*  this. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5960.62s)]
*  Obviously you can't even see infrared light with this. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5961.62s)]
*  So they realized there's invisible light beyond the red, invisible to the eye, but visible [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5963.44s)]
*  to sensors and detectors. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5968.72s)]
*  So what web has are a series of detectors like these things. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5970.9s)]
*  These are like chips. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5974.06s)]
*  These are actually superconductors, which I want to talk to you about this recent claim [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5975.5s)]
*  of detectors that can conduct electricity with no resistance. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5978.42s)]
*  These are superconductors. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5982.9400000000005s)]
*  Nevertheless, these are like computer chips like Dell makes around the corner here. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5983.9400000000005s)]
*  If you put that, but they detect heat, those detectors don't detect light. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5989.54s)]
*  They don't care about light. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5994.46s)]
*  They care about heat. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5995.46s)]
*  So if you put them at the focus of a telescope and you spread out the light using something [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=5996.46s)]
*  like this to disperse the light such that only infrared light falls on that telescope, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6000.26s)]
*  then you will be detecting infrared radiation from whatever objects you look at. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6005.22s)]
*  Now if you pointed at a galaxy that's far off in the distance or a quasar, that light [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6010.06s)]
*  has been red shifted. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6015.26s)]
*  It's been moved all the way from where it started in the visible light because those [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6017.18s)]
*  galaxies are made of suns and stars just like ours. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6020.9800000000005s)]
*  So they should have visible light, but they're mostly red. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6024.1s)]
*  Only the web telescope can see those with the kind of clarity and distinction that they're [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6027.280000000001s)]
*  able to perceive it. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6030.900000000001s)]
*  What was claimed by a paper, and actually I've been communicating with the author. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6032.82s)]
*  So one of the cool things about having a podcast is that when someone puts out a claim, oh [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6038.74s)]
*  like a superconductor that works at room temperature which would revolutionize or there's fusion, [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6041.78s)]
*  not fission, but fusion that exists now for the first time, I can call them up and say, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6047.0599999999995s)]
*  hey, I have this fun podcast. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6051.179999999999s)]
*  Would you like to come on? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6052.179999999999s)]
*  I've had a Nobel Prize winners and billionaires and whatever. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6053.179999999999s)]
*  And they come on and I can nerd out about science with it. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6055.86s)]
*  It's super fun. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6058.179999999999s)]
*  So I did an interview with this woman, this poor friend of mine, Allison Kirkpatrick in [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6059.5s)]
*  Kansas. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6065.54s)]
*  She was quoted as saying like, I can't sleep. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6066.58s)]
*  The universe is not the way it's supposed to be. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6070.66s)]
*  Webb has revealed and just shattered all my dreams about what the universe is really like. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6072.84s)]
*  And this guy, I don't want to use their names, but this guy pulled that quote and said, this [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6078.66s)]
*  proves the Big Bang never happened. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6083.22s)]
*  That was the first thing that happened after Webb came out last year. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6086.78s)]
*  This gentleman is claiming that the universe is infinitely old and that the reason that [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6089.86s)]
*  you see red galaxies is not because they're red shifted by the expansion of this. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6095.259999999999s)]
*  If I kept blowing up this beach ball, these things would be moving apart from each other, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6100.0599999999995s)]
*  red shifting their wavelengths away from one another. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6103.98s)]
*  He's saying, no, that's not what's happening. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6107.54s)]
*  Instead, astronomers are foolish. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6109.98s)]
*  They've been overwhelmed by this notion of the Big Bang. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6112.0599999999995s)]
*  The Big Bang never happened. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6114.78s)]
*  But light is losing energy and getting more and more red as it travels to us in an infinite [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6116.3s)]
*  universe that's infinitely old. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6122.219999999999s)]
*  Is this person qualified to make this statement? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6124.759999999999s)]
*  This person has marginal qualifications. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6127.219999999999s)]
*  They give away the tell in poker language of this guy's non-seriousness is that he wrote [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6129.9s)]
*  the same thing 30 years ago when the Hubble telescope was launched. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6133.94s)]
*  He's had the same thing and he has a book. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6137.219999999999s)]
*  But the second thing that you tweeted relative to was not that the universe was infinitely [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6139.42s)]
*  old, that it was twice as old as we thought. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6143.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's like 26 something billion years old. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6145.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6148.54s)]
*  So we, so I did a podcast with Alison Kirkpatrick and she and I went through this guy's claims. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6149.54s)]
*  And then the next day, and we showed what he was saying is slightly different. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6155.82s)]
*  He's saying the universe has a finite age, that a Big Bang like event happened, but because [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6159.74s)]
*  of these properties of galaxies that I'll explain in just one minute, because of the [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6165.18s)]
*  properties of the galaxies, the universe has to be much, much older than astronomers [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6168.62s)]
*  claimed. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6173.9s)]
*  He doesn't say you guys are fools and idiots and he's a legitimate professor in Ottawa. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6174.9s)]
*  His name is Roger Gupta. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6177.54s)]
*  The day after, so we went through it, took it apart. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6180.3s)]
*  I thought it was pretty convincing and he even agreed that there are problems with it [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6183.54s)]
*  and worse or better, he has integrity. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6187.58s)]
*  Let me just say that. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6191.22s)]
*  that his media office was kind of responsible for eventually leading to the tweet that you [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6192.9800000000005s)]
*  produced because what happens in academia... [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6200.1s)]
*  Oh, so they were trying to get attention. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6202.3s)]
*  Well, so I call this the academia media hype complex. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6204.54s)]
*  So ordinarily you're working on something and let's say you discover, oh, there's this [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6209.22s)]
*  new material and it has a breaking point of 10,000 kilograms per millimeter. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6213.06s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, it's cool. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6218.34s)]
*  It's interesting. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6219.740000000001s)]
*  It's important. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6220.740000000001s)]
*  No one's saying it's going to revolutionize spirituality, theology and have our meanings [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6221.74s)]
*  restored, but it's important. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6226.139999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6229.0199999999995s)]
*  It's some object. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6230.0199999999995s)]
*  But sometimes there'll be something that will be enough of a surprise that the professor [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6231.34s)]
*  like me will then go and say to their dean, hey, this cool result. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6236.9s)]
*  I'm kind of sitting on it. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6242.219999999999s)]
*  I think it could be kind of big. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6243.219999999999s)]
*  Then the press office, we have a press office at UCSD. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6245.179999999999s)]
*  I've done this before. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6248.38s)]
*  There's going to be some big news coming out about our result. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6249.82s)]
*  That's very interesting. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6252.5s)]
*  The university starts to promote it. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6254.02s)]
*  Then a local newspaper, in my case, San Diego Union Tribune, in his case, the Ottawa Times [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6256.42s)]
*  or whatever, they'll start to kind of promote it. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6261.46s)]
*  And then if it's really provocative, it might make national news or in the physics news. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6264.76s)]
*  And then if it's incredibly provocative, one of the world's foremost influencers might [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6269.4800000000005s)]
*  say something about it. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6274.66s)]
*  And then Elon Musk might retweet and say that actually he thinks dark matter is even more [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6276.08s)]
*  sketchy than the age of the universe. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6280.34s)]
*  So this in the astronomer community just sent people into apoplexy. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6282.32s)]
*  They were going, no, these guys should not be talking about, like I have friends, like [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6286.5199999999995s)]
*  Elon Musk shouldn't even talk about this because he launched a satellite in SpaceX whose main [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6290.88s)]
*  job is to detect dark. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6295.54s)]
*  I'm like, what are you guys talking about? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6296.88s)]
*  When laypeople, and Elon's a technically minded person. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6299.8s)]
*  He has a physics background as an undergraduate. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6302.4s)]
*  He's not a physicist. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6304.72s)]
*  He's a scientist working to discover new laws of nature and employ the scientific method. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6306.4800000000005s)]
*  He's good at engineering and he's an incredible businessman and visionary person, but he's [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6310.16s)]
*  not so he's kind of a proxy for a smart layman. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6313.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6317.4800000000005s)]
*  In this sense, there's nothing wrong with that. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6318.4800000000005s)]
*  But people then perceive this as like now these influencers are now overturning the [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6320.76s)]
*  work of literally thousands of astronomers and physicists working right now on legitimate [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6327.2s)]
*  scientific topics. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6332.4400000000005s)]
*  Let's get back to the actual claim itself. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6333.72s)]
*  So this is where we're getting away from this a little bit. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6335.959999999999s)]
*  So this claim of 26 billion years, is that does it make any sense? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6339.919999999999s)]
*  So it can make sense in the following context. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6345.5599999999995s)]
*  Imagine you see a planet and on that planet there are people and they're playing around [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6350.08s)]
*  with like these electrified pieces of silicon and you'd be like, wait a second, like that's [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6354.48s)]
*  really weird. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6361.28s)]
*  Like that planet's only four billion years old. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6362.28s)]
*  How is it possible that they're not only able to talk on electrified silicon, but they're [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6364.48s)]
*  also like having an internet and space flight? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6369.16s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6371.759999999999s)]
*  It takes longer. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6372.759999999999s)]
*  In my model of how civilizations form, it must have taken eight billion years for that [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6373.759999999999s)]
*  to happen. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6378.32s)]
*  So therefore, it's impossible to reconcile with the earth being 4.3 billion years old. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6379.32s)]
*  Therefore the earth must be eight billion years old. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6385.839999999999s)]
*  What he said, this guy Gupta said, there are properties of galaxies. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6388.2s)]
*  They're rotating, they're appearing too early on the universe's early history to have developed [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6391.72s)]
*  into the spiral characteristics and the population distribution of them is too numerous to have [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6398.64s)]
*  occurred in a universe that's only quote unquote 13 billion years. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6404.2s)]
*  And you actually said that. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6407.72s)]
*  You said like, I always thought 13 billion is a pretty big number. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6408.72s)]
*  Now they're saying 27, so what's the difference? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6412.240000000001s)]
*  But there's a big difference because implicit in that criticism is that there are flaws [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6414.16s)]
*  and imperfections in how we understand the Big Bang. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6418.46s)]
*  When in reality at best, he could be correct about the formation of galaxies. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6423.34s)]
*  But you see those are two separate things, right? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6428.14s)]
*  The formation and the structure of a galaxy has no bearing on how old the universe is [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6430.54s)]
*  necessarily. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6435.74s)]
*  It tells you something about your models of computer simulations is what he's effectively [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6436.9800000000005s)]
*  criticizing, not criticizing the evidence that something like a Big Bang occurred at [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6441.02s)]
*  a very definite point in the universe's past that we believe to about one to the we have [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6447.5s)]
*  equivalent precision for me to say I know how old you are exactly. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6452.78s)]
*  But if you looked at a 50 year old person, you could say, you know, the day they were [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6456.54s)]
*  born plus or minus a week, like that's the precision with which modern astronomers know [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6460.9800000000005s)]
*  the age of the universe. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6466.3s)]
*  And one guy is coming up with this idea that because there's certain galaxies within it [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6468.14s)]
*  that have formed this. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6472.54s)]
*  Again, imagine if we found like a hyper advanced civilization that has warp drives and does [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6473.66s)]
*  it for this type three Dyson civilizations or whatever. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6478.34s)]
*  They would not cast doubt on the evolution and the history of the universe itself. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6481.9s)]
*  That would not cause me to question that. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6488.9s)]
*  It would cause me to question my models of how popular people form and aliens form and [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6490.5s)]
*  stuff like that. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6494.78s)]
*  But it wouldn't cause me to question the age of the universe. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6495.78s)]
*  There's nothing related to it. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6497.82s)]
*  When we are studying the age of the universe and the vastness of space, is it is there [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6499.14s)]
*  potentially new technology that would expose more than we currently can view that would [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6507.34s)]
*  change your model? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6513.900000000001s)]
*  In the sense that we are jobs as scientists, especially me as an experimentalist in contrast [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6516.780000000001s)]
*  to people like Brian Cox, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Eric Weinstein, etc. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6522.7s)]
*  My job is not to prove theories right. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6528.94s)]
*  My job is actually to prove them wrong. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6531.8s)]
*  That's really what I get paid to do is to narrow and winnow out so much so that what [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6534.16s)]
*  is left is the truth. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6539.54s)]
*  There's a quote by Isaac Asimov. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6540.74s)]
*  He said, if you think the earth is flat, you're wrong. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6542.099999999999s)]
*  If you think it's a perfect sphere, you're also wrong because it's not a perfect sphere. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6545.9s)]
*  It actually bulges at the equator. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6550.42s)]
*  It has properties because the earth is spinning and the way it forms it's a little bit like [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6552.02s)]
*  a pear. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6556.46s)]
*  It's also not, but it's much less wrong to say it's a sphere than to say it's flat. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6557.46s)]
*  Our job is to continually find the flaws, the cracks that as it's said, the cracks let [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6563.58s)]
*  the light in. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6571.5s)]
*  Our job is to find the flaws in the existing paradigms, shatter those and refine those. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6572.5s)]
*  There's countless examples of that throughout scientific history. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6577.46s)]
*  There are ways that I would be caused to doubt the formation story of galaxies. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6582.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6587.22s)]
*  That's almost like predicting hurricanes. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6588.22s)]
*  I just came through a hurricane to see you. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6590.54s)]
*  There's a big hurricane in San Diego this week and it's like an inch of rain. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6592.58s)]
*  You know how we drive in Southern California. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6596.42s)]
*  Even the slick of trace of rain causes us to go into total terror. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6599.46s)]
*  We didn't know where it was going to make exact landfall because climate is an example, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6605.38s)]
*  as I said earlier, not of something that's merely complicated. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6610.52s)]
*  It's complex. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6613.7s)]
*  The best way to simulate the earth's climate is with another earth. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6615.1s)]
*  In other words, there's no irreducible way to reduce the amount of complexity to describe [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6619.22s)]
*  a physical system than the system itself. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6624.42s)]
*  That's a notion of complexity. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6626.78s)]
*  That's a definition of complexity. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6628.18s)]
*  In the context of what you said, absolutely. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6631.5s)]
*  People like Allison and others, Kirk Patrick, they definitely would be more thrilled than [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6634.38s)]
*  anybody to discover, well, we don't understand. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6639.06s)]
*  There's something wrong with our model of how the universe, not how the universe formed, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6642.34s)]
*  but how galaxies formed. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6646.3s)]
*  What I'm asking is, with the levels of detection that we have available, how significant is [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6648.3s)]
*  the change in what the web is able to do? [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6655.58s)]
*  Is it possible that ... When we're looking, is it whatever levels of detection, whatever [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6658.66s)]
*  methods of detection we have now, is it absolute that if you go to 13 point whatever billion [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6665.5s)]
*  years, we couldn't have better methods of detection? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6673.139999999999s)]
*  There's no way we would get more data, more information, and would it change? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6676.5s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6680.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6681.3s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6682.3s)]
*  I misinterpreted what you said. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6683.3s)]
*  Is it possible that with new technology, we would be able to see more, and then you [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6684.3s)]
*  would remap this idea? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6690.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6692.06s)]
*  Let me explain. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6693.06s)]
*  Sorry, I misinterpreted what you said earlier, but now I can correct it. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6694.06s)]
*  Yes, and the good news is that's what the Simons Observatory is trying to do. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6696.38s)]
*  The web telescope was never built for, nor can it say anything about the Big Bang, or [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6700.34s)]
*  what caused the Big Bang, or- [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6705.84s)]
*  It's just galaxy formations. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6707.46s)]
*  Not just, by the way. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6709.3s)]
*  That's a pretty big deal, but it's- [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6710.3s)]
*  Galaxy formation, probably the stars, exoplanets, the atmospheres, the chemistry, civilizations [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6712.1s)]
*  on exoplanets, it can do so much cool stuff. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6717.58s)]
*  Now, that's not my scientific area of expertise. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6720.22s)]
*  What I study is this, the cosmic microwave background. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6724.02s)]
*  There are only three long-range messengers that can be used in astronomy. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6727.620000000001s)]
*  Astronomy is really hard, unlike, say, biology. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6733.38s)]
*  Remember in high school, you had a frog or a cow's eyeball or whatever. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6736.54s)]
*  You could dissect, oh, there's another frog. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6741.54s)]
*  Your buddy could do it better than you, and you should get the same results. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6743.78s)]
*  There's multiple examples. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6747.06s)]
*  You can do a control. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6748.14s)]
*  You can leave that frog alone, and then dissect this frog, and then put from out the hut, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6749.74s)]
*  and whatever. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6754.06s)]
*  I don't know what these biologists do, to be honest with you, but when I dissected the [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6755.06s)]
*  frog, it came back to life. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6758.1s)]
*  I was terrible at biology, and that's what became my astronomer. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6759.1s)]
*  It came back to life? [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6761.58s)]
*  It came back to- No, I'm just kidding. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6762.58s)]
*  You can do a variable and a control. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6766.74s)]
*  How do you do a control when there's only one thing? [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6768.78s)]
*  Universe. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6771.54s)]
*  There's only one cosmos, right? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6772.54s)]
*  We can't do experiments, but what we can do is we can make use of everything that comes [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6774.46s)]
*  to us in various forms. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6778.42s)]
*  There's only really three or four different types of things that come to us from great [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6780.94s)]
*  distances. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6783.98s)]
*  I brought some of those here with me today to give to you and to Jamie. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6784.98s)]
*  Some of them are meteorites, right? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6789.259999999999s)]
*  There's a meteorite. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6790.82s)]
*  There's a meteorite. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6791.82s)]
*  That's going to be Jamie, so be careful with him. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6794.82s)]
*  Now, you, your birthday is the peak of the Perseid meteor shower. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6797.26s)]
*  It's one of the best meteor showers of the year typically, so next year on your birthday, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6801.34s)]
*  I'll remind you, go out, go to a dark spot, and just look up. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6805.5s)]
*  You don't need binoculars. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6809.06s)]
*  You don't need a telescope. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6810.06s)]
*  You don't need nothing. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6811.06s)]
*  You'll see, on average, a couple of meteors per hour burning up in the atmosphere. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6812.5s)]
*  Those came from parts of our solar system, or Avi Loeb, our mutual friend, has discovered [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6816.860000000001s)]
*  what he claims and seems to be pretty likely is fragments of a meteorite from another solar [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6822.4s)]
*  system that could potentially contain alloy. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6828.16s)]
*  In other words, not metal. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6831.5199999999995s)]
*  This is pure metal. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6833.98s)]
*  So this is your birthday gift. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6834.98s)]
*  This is one of your birthday gifts. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6835.98s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6837.24s)]
*  So that's pretty heavy, right? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6838.24s)]
*  That's a real meteorite. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6839.24s)]
*  That's a real meteorite. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6840.24s)]
*  Now, how do you know it's a meteorite? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6841.24s)]
*  So check it out. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6842.28s)]
*  That is a fragment of the early solar system. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6843.88s)]
*  It's actually older than the Earth. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6846.84s)]
*  It's about 4.3 billion years old. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6848.46s)]
*  How do I know with a magnet? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6851.6s)]
*  Well, so these materials are very, very unusual in terms of their composition relative to [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6852.88s)]
*  things on Earth. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6858.740000000001s)]
*  Here's a more powerful magnet. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6859.740000000001s)]
*  That's more powerful than this big one? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6861.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, look at it. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6862.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's a cheap Chinese piece of junk. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6863.96s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy, the difference. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6865.72s)]
*  Yeah, check this out. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6867.120000000001s)]
*  They said pull forward. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6868.120000000001s)]
*  This is a robbery. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6869.120000000001s)]
*  That was like, yeah. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6870.120000000001s)]
*  So that big meteorite crashed in Argentina about 7,000 years ago. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6873.22s)]
*  It was found by tribesmen and tribeswomen in the 1500s, I believe. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6879.56s)]
*  And they started to take it. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6884.400000000001s)]
*  And what would you do with a chunk of metal back in the 1500s, Joe? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6885.400000000001s)]
*  Make swords out of it. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6888.84s)]
*  They made arrowheads, which you would do too, probably, right? [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6889.84s)]
*  So they just made it into weapons of war and whatnot. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6892.4400000000005s)]
*  And then finally it was realized in the 1800s, 1900s, it was a meteorite. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6894.56s)]
*  How big was it? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6897.92s)]
*  It was huge, thousands and thousands of pounds, tens of thousands of pounds. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6898.92s)]
*  I have one big sample even bigger than that one. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6902.64s)]
*  So here's some information for you. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6905.76s)]
*  These little guys, I give these away on my website. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6908.12s)]
*  These are much, much tinier little fragments. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6910.96s)]
*  Those should be some very exclusive arrowheads if you get a hold of those. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6914.28s)]
*  Yeah, so my dream is to make these things into rings. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6917.88s)]
*  You know how like Ryan Holiday has these like momentum or coins or whatever? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6920.36s)]
*  So my merch someday, my dream is to make them into rings. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6925.76s)]
*  Because they look super cool. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6928.96s)]
*  Ever seen a Rolex meteorite watch? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6929.96s)]
*  Yeah, the meteorite surface, that's the stone? [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6931.96s)]
*  That's it, that's the rock. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6934.8s)]
*  That's the metal chunk. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6937.0s)]
*  And how many years ago did this slam into the earth? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6938.0s)]
*  That's 7,000 years ago. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6939.52s)]
*  Wow. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6940.92s)]
*  And so we've- [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6941.92s)]
*  That must have done a fuckload of damage. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6942.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was a big crater. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6945.36s)]
*  And that's just one fragment of it. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6946.48s)]
*  It's strewn over several kilometers and some of the pieces are even bigger than that one. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6947.68s)]
*  This is a relative- so now the Argentinian government has banned export of it. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6952.0s)]
*  So actually you can't get these. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6955.16s)]
*  So this is like a stockpile that I have. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6957.08s)]
*  I give them away, but these are fun. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6958.92s)]
*  So we did an isotopic test on it. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6961.76s)]
*  We found out what's the ratio of it. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6963.64s)]
*  So these can only form in space. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6965.12s)]
*  They have certain properties that can only form in space. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6966.4s)]
*  So this is one of the four long-range messengers that come throughout the cosmos. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6968.28s)]
*  The other one is gravitational waves. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6973.08s)]
*  We talked about those earlier. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6975.12s)]
*  Those travel at the speed of light. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6976.88s)]
*  These travel 20,000 miles per hour, but it's pretty fast, but it's not speed of light, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6978.16s)]
*  which is 186,000 miles per second. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6982.36s)]
*  The other type of thing that travels near the speed of light, possibly at the speed [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6985.12s)]
*  of light, are called neutrinos. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6988.28s)]
*  Neutrinos are these ghost particles that are basically almost massless. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6990.88s)]
*  They interact with almost nothing except for other types of weakly interacting material. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=6995.08s)]
*  And then the third thing are photons. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7000.72s)]
*  So you ask the question, could new technology reveal properties not about the age of galaxies, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7002.12s)]
*  but the age of the universe, that would cause me to question things? [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7007.04s)]
*  And that's exactly what I do. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7010.12s)]
*  So our telescopes, the Simons Observatory, the one that I talked about earlier, it's [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7012.04s)]
*  a $110 million project, which will last over a decade. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7016.0s)]
*  And that project is aimed at not just measuring the light. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7020.32s)]
*  The earliest light in the universe is called the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7025.28s)]
*  It's the leftover heat that was left over after the first atoms formed. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7030.08s)]
*  A smallest, most simple atom, hydrogen, when it formed, there was still heat in the universe [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7035.4s)]
*  at that time. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7040.2s)]
*  That was about 400,000 years after the Big Bang. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7041.2s)]
*  So you can't see further back than that light, because that's when the first light is produced. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7045.639999999999s)]
*  You can't see light earlier than that. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7050.28s)]
*  The galaxies that Webb is seeing is 300 million years old. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7052.64s)]
*  In other words, that's from the universe is 300,000 times older than what we can see just [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7056.08s)]
*  with microwaves. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7060.72s)]
*  But that's not good enough, right? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7062.4s)]
*  We don't want to just see the 380,000 year old universe. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7064.28s)]
*  We want to see it at time equals zero, or as close as we can get. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7067.44s)]
*  Because there's some people that say there wasn't just one Big Bang. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7071.7s)]
*  There have been multiple Big Bangs, but there are other Big Bangs going on right now. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7075.2s)]
*  Some say there was a single Big Bang that just emerged from pure energy. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7079.36s)]
*  Some say that there was a universe that existed before our universe, and it collapsed. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7083.139999999999s)]
*  And the material that would later become our universe emerged from what's called the Big [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7088.44s)]
*  Crunch, or a bouncing, collapsing universe. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7091.92s)]
*  And these are different models. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7096.0199999999995s)]
*  My job is not to prove them, right? [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7097.32s)]
*  It's to eliminate whatever ones of those I can with my team, obviously. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7099.16s)]
*  And in so doing, our new technology, which is the most cutting-edge technology ever made, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7103.759999999999s)]
*  and might be the last of its kind, operating in Chile, which is turning on later this year, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7108.4s)]
*  is going to start revealing the answer to those questions. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7113.679999999999s)]
*  And the way that it will do that is really a combination of three different tools. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7117.96s)]
*  The only three tools astronomers have. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7123.04s)]
*  Telescopes, detectors and telescopes, brains, you know, that do theoretical work and make [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7125.16s)]
*  models, and then computers to simulate and to assess the data. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7131.2s)]
*  We synthesize those three tools. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7134.759999999999s)]
*  We hope that we'll find new information. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7136.68s)]
*  Will it change the age of the universe from 13.8 billion years to 26 billion years? [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7140.400000000001s)]
*  I don't want to say absolutely not, but there's almost no chance of that. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7146.160000000001s)]
*  Because it's fundamentally almost like a different type of science. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7149.56s)]
*  It's like saying, I'm going to tell you about the age of homo sapiens on Earth based on [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7152.08s)]
*  planetary geological forces. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7157.54s)]
*  Like okay, you can't have a person before there was a planet, so there's some relationship, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7160.400000000001s)]
*  but it's very tenuous. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7164.6s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7166.08s)]
*  Very tenuous. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7167.08s)]
*  What, if anything, can be done other than what we're doing right now to try to detect [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7168.08s)]
*  whether or not there is either signals from intelligent species out there somewhere, or [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7176.320000000001s)]
*  some sort of evidence of them in terms of some manipulation of their atmosphere or something [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7184.08s)]
*  like that? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7190.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7191.6s)]
*  Yeah, and this is obviously a big topic. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7192.6s)]
*  I really wouldn't have gotten so interested in it. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7194.28s)]
*  I used to really dismiss it. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7196.5199999999995s)]
*  I still am, probably you'd call me an alien minimalist, because I think there's almost [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7197.92s)]
*  no chance that there are aliens. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7203.28s)]
*  Certainly there's almost, I would say there's almost no chance that there's intelligent [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7205.719999999999s)]
*  technological aliens. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7209.8s)]
*  In other words, it could be slime mold on some exoplanet proximus in Tury B, but we [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7210.8s)]
*  never know about it because they don't have thumbs and technology. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7215.639999999999s)]
*  But I even think that that might be impossible, or as close to impossible. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7219.16s)]
*  It's a good science that I should never say zero chance are aliens or zero. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7222.84s)]
*  But as you go down the logical chain, as you go down the evolutionary chain of, say, alien [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7226.72s)]
*  technology, as you said, could they be communicating with us? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7232.200000000001s)]
*  Well, we only know of these three different ways that they can communicate with us. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7234.96s)]
*  The three things I brought here, the meteorites that could send objects, trash. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7238.56s)]
*  Avi Love thinks these are trash. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7243.160000000001s)]
*  He went to Papua New Guinea. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7245.400000000001s)]
*  He scooped up some of these little fragments of a meteorite. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7246.64s)]
*  You should definitely have them back on. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7249.160000000001s)]
*  It was a phenomenal episode with him. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7250.88s)]
*  He and I had a conversation, very technical, but I like to think I can complement some [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7253.400000000001s)]
*  of the cool stuff that you do by going deep into the astronomy so that my colleagues actually [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7257.16s)]
*  get some interest out of it too. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7261.52s)]
*  But when we think about craft, now you're not sending things other than sending neutrino [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7264.08s)]
*  beams to us or sending gravitational waves to us or sending light. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7271.08s)]
*  Those are all things that propagate near the speed of light. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7275.88s)]
*  This is very slow. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7277.96s)]
*  This is very, very slow. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7279.08s)]
*  To get this here, that took thousands and thousands of years just orbiting around the [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7280.2s)]
*  Earth, but even if it came from another solar system, we have no idea where it came from. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7285.0s)]
*  Well, I'm going to stop you because you went way off track a little bit. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7288.5199999999995s)]
*  You said, I want to be clear on what you're saying. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7293.44s)]
*  Do you think there's no possibility for alien life in the universe? [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7296.12s)]
*  I think it's, I didn't say it's no probability. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7301.04s)]
*  I think the probability is very low and I can explain why. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7303.32s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7306.08s)]
*  So have you ever heard of the Drake equation? [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7307.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7309.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7310.88s)]
*  So the Drake equation is essentially a parameterization of our ignorance about certain things in the [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7311.88s)]
*  universe. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7316.24s)]
*  And we've kind of checked off seven of the terms and the eight terms of the Drake equation [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7317.24s)]
*  thanks to new technology, thanks to new telescopes. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7322.12s)]
*  How many stars have planets around them? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7324.8s)]
*  How many... [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7326.88s)]
*  But there's a couple terms in there. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7327.88s)]
*  The lifetime of a civilization and a certain fraction of how much that civilization could [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7329.4s)]
*  dedicate its energy or what have you towards broadcasting its presence, right? [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7335.48s)]
*  So for us to know that they exist, they have to make technology for them to exist and they [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7340.48s)]
*  have to exist in the first place. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7346.4s)]
*  So how many of such objects are there? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7347.599999999999s)]
*  That's what the Drake equations really parameterizing. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7349.2s)]
*  Now I propose that you should be able to do the following thing. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7353.719999999999s)]
*  If there's life in the universe, just life, slime mold, I don't care what it is, you should [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7358.04s)]
*  be able to set limits on it in the following sense. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7362.68s)]
*  And what I'm going to do is do a radicchio ad absurdium. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7366.96s)]
*  I'm going to prove, I'm going to motivate, hopefully I can't prove, but I'm going to [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7369.4400000000005s)]
*  motivate the illogic of suspecting that they're extraterrestrial intelligence civilization. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7372.96s)]
*  Okay, here it goes. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7378.84s)]
*  Let me just tell you, my colleagues discovered that there's a planet and it's around a star [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7380.92s)]
*  that's just like our sun. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7387.320000000001s)]
*  It's next to another planet and that planet's full of life. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7389.5199999999995s)]
*  And the other planet's almost identical to that planet. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7393.759999999999s)]
*  It's almost the same size. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7397.5599999999995s)]
*  It has a day the same age, the same length as the day of the planet that has just rotten [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7398.759999999999s)]
*  with life. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7403.639999999999s)]
*  It's crawling with Kardashians and slime molds and whatever, right? [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7404.639999999999s)]
*  So it's out there. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7408.4s)]
*  Okay, just like us. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7409.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7410.4s)]
*  And I said to Joe, what do you think the odds are that those two neighboring planets, there's [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7411.4s)]
*  no reason physically they shouldn't both be identical. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7414.5199999999995s)]
*  What are the odds that the other one should not have life? [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7418.08s)]
*  What would you say? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7420.84s)]
*  With the same environment? [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7423.0s)]
*  The same solar system environment, same properties, rocky planet, had liquid water, it has an [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7424.0s)]
*  atmosphere, it has a magnetic field, you know, has all sorts of things. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7430.5199999999995s)]
*  I would think it would be more likely that it would have life. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7433.599999999999s)]
*  Very likely. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7436.599999999999s)]
*  It would be extremely likely. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7437.599999999999s)]
*  Okay, now let me tell you that that planet exists. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7438.599999999999s)]
*  It's called Mars and I brought you a piece of it here. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7441.5199999999995s)]
*  This is a fragment. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7445.12s)]
*  Okay, so this goes in order of expense. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7446.12s)]
*  So these things I give away, that big meteorite is a present for you. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7448.64s)]
*  This is a piece of Mars. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7454.84s)]
*  This I only give to you. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7456.84s)]
*  I don't have one for Jamie. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7457.84s)]
*  That's an actual piece of Mars. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7458.84s)]
*  That's an actual piece of Mars. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7460.12s)]
*  So from an asteroid? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7461.12s)]
*  So what happened was the Earth gets hit by meteors all the time, but so do all the other [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7462.92s)]
*  planets. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7468.68s)]
*  Sometimes some of that material from Mars gets impacted. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7469.68s)]
*  Imagine something that big that Jamie showed before, slamming into, it's going to eject [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7472.56s)]
*  it from the surface of Mars. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7476.0s)]
*  That's going to orbit in the clouds of Mars. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7477.280000000001s)]
*  It's eventually going to get outside the atmosphere of Mars if the impact is great enough, carrying [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7479.360000000001s)]
*  some of the debris, the surface, the crust of Mars, etc. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7483.200000000001s)]
*  And that will then percolate throughout the solar system for tens of millions of years, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7486.320000000001s)]
*  perhaps, until the Earth smashes into it and it lands, in this case it landed in Africa. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7489.52s)]
*  That was recovered from Africa. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7494.080000000001s)]
*  That little third of a gram is a slice off a bigger chunk, okay? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7496.320000000001s)]
*  Not only does that piece of Mars doesn't have any signature of life on it, and we've been [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7501.88s)]
*  to Mars, we've stuck probes into Mars, we have a helicopter, freaking helicopter flying [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7506.88s)]
*  around on Mars right now. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7511.08s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7512.72s)]
*  We don't see anything. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7514.400000000001s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean that life didn't exist there before. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7515.400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't mean that if we don't fly into a lava cave there won't be. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7518.52s)]
*  But does it not say something? [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7521.92s)]
*  This is called panspermia, something that sounds dirty, but it's not. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7524.14s)]
*  No, I know that term. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7527.400000000001s)]
*  So we exchange material, and actually Sir Fred Hoyle, the guy who came up with the idea [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7529.24s)]
*  for the name the Big Bang, he actually believed in the steady state model, he believed that's [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7533.64s)]
*  how life was seeded on Earth. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7538.76s)]
*  The fact is that we've been exchanging material for literally billions of years, from when [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7541.04s)]
*  the Earth was just bacteria and Mars was flowing with water. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7545.24s)]
*  We know Mars was rich with water. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7549.56s)]
*  Now the fact that we don't see any is that proof it never had, absolute and not. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7551.84s)]
*  But I'm just saying it's a piece of evidence, and that evidence is very hard to come by. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7555.42s)]
*  It's hard to prove a negative. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7560.16s)]
*  It's hard to say that Mars definitely never had life. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7561.5s)]
*  Can I stop you there? [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7563.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7564.9400000000005s)]
*  How much detection do we have? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7565.9400000000005s)]
*  How much technology is currently on Mars that's looking at signs of life? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7567.46s)]
*  There have been probes since Viking and so forth. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7573.22s)]
*  How many of them are capable of detecting signs of life other than physical things? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7576.42s)]
*  All of them have had some capability for precursors to life. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7580.18s)]
*  In other words, some have been able to detect water, some have had spectrometers that could [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7583.9s)]
*  detect gases, carbon ash. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7587.139999999999s)]
*  How many of them have landed? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7588.58s)]
*  Probably 15 or 20. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7590.7s)]
*  And Mars is, what is it, how much smaller than Earth? [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7591.98s)]
*  It's about a third. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7595.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little bigger than the moon, but a lot smaller. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7596.42s)]
*  It seems like a lot of space that we didn't detect things on or didn't even visit. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7599.179999999999s)]
*  But isn't that the converse of the usual argument that I hear? [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7606.42s)]
*  There's a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7610.259999999999s)]
*  Many of them are like the sun. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7613.58s)]
*  There's a hundred billion galaxies or more like the Milky Way, so it's a hundred billion [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7615.0599999999995s)]
*  squared. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7619.14s)]
*  The universe is 13.8 billion years old. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7620.38s)]
*  So what are the odds? [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7623.38s)]
*  Usually astronomers will do calculations a following way. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7625.58s)]
*  Instead of asking what's the probability of that. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7628.9s)]
*  For example, I've been to Antarctica twice. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7632.74s)]
*  I've been to the South Pole, which you would just be bored out of your mind probably, because [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7634.78s)]
*  all it is is going out into the middle of the Pacific Ocean and freezing it. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7639.22s)]
*  There's nothing to do there. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7642.3s)]
*  The coast of Antarctica is really cool. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7643.42s)]
*  So this is a rock from there. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7645.54s)]
*  They have volcanoes there. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7646.9s)]
*  That's not for you, but that one I got to take back because that cost me $50,000. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7648.62s)]
*  That cost you, the taxpayer, $50,000. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7651.78s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7653.78s)]
*  But this you can keep. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7654.78s)]
*  This is from the South Pole's gift shop, Joe. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7655.78s)]
*  That's a patch from the United States. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7657.9400000000005s)]
*  We have such cool freaking scientists, man. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7659.9s)]
*  Our country and the world. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7662.06s)]
*  I just heard something. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7664.38s)]
*  I was like, I wonder if Joe knows this. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7665.78s)]
*  It's totally random, but just look how cool is freaking science. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7668.1s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7671.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you know they can measure ... I'll get back to your question in just a second. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7673.139999999999s)]
*  They measure the stress levels of whales, and they can use the stress of whales to determine [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7676.259999999999s)]
*  if the Soviets or the Russians are testing bombs under the ocean floor. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7683.5s)]
*  I'm like, what the hell? [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7688.419999999999s)]
*  I heard this talk recently. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7689.419999999999s)]
*  A woman studying whale earwax. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7690.66s)]
*  So whales don't have ears that stick out and not be good for swimming around. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7693.5s)]
*  There's a lot of friction. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7696.94s)]
*  But they have these vestigial things because they evolve from wolves. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7698.58s)]
*  I always thought stuff came out of the water and that whales evolved into wolves. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7702.0599999999995s)]
*  No, they think that wolves turned into whales. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7706.18s)]
*  Really? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7708.5s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7709.5s)]
*  Wolves? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7710.5s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7711.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7712.5s)]
*  This, Jamie Hadsworth, because I am a total ignoramus, but this is a going theory. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7713.5s)]
*  That whales evolved from wolves. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7715.78s)]
*  So like most mammals, they have ears. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7717.94s)]
*  Those ears have been covered over. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7720.18s)]
*  What happens to a whale is that it retains earwax. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7722.62s)]
*  There's earwax in the whale. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7726.26s)]
*  The whale doesn't hear with its ears. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7727.26s)]
*  It hears through its jawbone and that reverberates and that's how it senses sound. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7728.26s)]
*  It still has vestigial earwax. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7732.42s)]
*  They sample the earwax of dead whales and they can measure how much cortisol, the stress [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7735.06s)]
*  hormone, is in the whale. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7740.42s)]
*  They know the migratory patterns of the whale. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7742.06s)]
*  And they do some of this research in Antarctica. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7745.860000000001s)]
*  That's really fascinating. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7748.14s)]
*  We're kind of getting off topic. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7749.14s)]
*  I know. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7750.14s)]
*  I want to understand how you can look at all of the variables that are possible in terms [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7751.14s)]
*  of the composition of planets, in terms of temperature, in terms of also different kinds [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7756.4s)]
*  of environments for life that we haven't encountered yet but could be real. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7762.719999999999s)]
*  Different kinds of life. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7767.28s)]
*  Things that are very, very alien to what we perceive of as carbon-based life forms. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7769.48s)]
*  I just don't understand how you're looking at one planet that has a very different environment [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7774.2s)]
*  than Earth, even though Earth has life and it doesn't. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7779.04s)]
*  And using that one example to sort of dismiss the possibility that in the insanely vast [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7782.24s)]
*  universe that there couldn't be something that's very similar to the conditions of Earth. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7788.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7794.16s)]
*  No. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7795.16s)]
*  100% right. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7796.16s)]
*  You're 100% right. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7797.16s)]
*  And I'm not saying that. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7798.16s)]
*  I'm not saying there's ... I'm ruling it out. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7799.16s)]
*  I'm saying there's what's called evidence, prior information. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7800.16s)]
*  And you should be able to say that how likely it is, you should be able to run a simulation, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7803.24s)]
*  say for every time there's a planet that's rotten with life like the Earth, there's some [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7807.84s)]
*  odds in the overlapping communal history of those two planets in a binary planet system [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7811.52s)]
*  that they should share life and that you'll get a number. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7816.64s)]
*  I'm not saying I know that number, but you should be using that as information to sort [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7818.84s)]
*  of say what is the fecundity? [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7823.080000000001s)]
*  How likely is it for life to get started? [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7825.84s)]
*  And once it starts going, I believe evolution can take over. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7828.0s)]
*  But you just kept this notion that because the universe is so vast ... [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7831.240000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7836.84s)]
*  But the reason I brought up Antarctica and these whales, and I know it sounds totally [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7837.84s)]
*  irrelevant, but I've been there twice. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7841.24s)]
*  There's four different animals that I've seen in an archive. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7843.2s)]
*  And there are these giant seagulls called skuas that will fricking rip your face off [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7846.92s)]
*  if you leave it outside. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7852.08s)]
*  They're just nasty birds. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7853.76s)]
*  There's penguins on the continent itself. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7855.8s)]
*  And there's seals and then there's people. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7859.4400000000005s)]
*  So this is one seventh of the continents of Earth. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7862.16s)]
*  There's almost no other life on Earth. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7865.04s)]
*  But imagine you could make the same argument. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7867.0s)]
*  The Earth is so big, and wherever there's a continent, there should be life. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7868.88s)]
*  But you don't see cities in Antarctica. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7872.32s)]
*  You don't see other ... Not even other people. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7874.28s)]
*  You don't see ... Well, there's still Neanderthals down there. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7877.56s)]
*  There were dinosaurs there at one point, but I'm saying right now. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7880.08s)]
*  So just by saying that there's the large number hypothesis is that there's so much possibility [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7883.36s)]
*  that that leads to probability. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7889.24s)]
*  That's a logical fallacy. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7891.12s)]
*  Just because there's a large number, there's a potential. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7892.52s)]
*  If Earth didn't exist. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7895.52s)]
*  But Earth does exist, and humans do exist, and Earth is rich with life forms. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7897.839999999999s)]
*  We know that it's possible. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7902.36s)]
*  We know that it's possible given the parameters that Earth enjoys. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7904.32s)]
*  That's what I say. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7906.88s)]
*  And we know that there's an insane amount of planets out there that could replicate [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7908.5199999999995s)]
*  this environment. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7913.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7914.28s)]
*  So wouldn't you then say, again, if you knew that life is so incredible, there's these [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7915.28s)]
*  extremophiles that live in volcanic vents 3,000 meters under the ocean. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7919.5199999999995s)]
*  So again, you have to say, what are the odds that we would not see life on Mars or on Enceladus? [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7924.24s)]
*  And I'm not saying, again, I'm not saying there's no other way. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7929.12s)]
*  But it's just Mars. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7930.92s)]
*  It's one example. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7932.16s)]
*  And it could be that life requires a very narrow window that we enjoy. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7933.32s)]
*  Sure. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7937.04s)]
*  That may be. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7938.04s)]
*  But look at all the other factors that go into the life existence on Earth. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7939.04s)]
*  We talked about Jupiter before. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7941.92s)]
*  There are scientists that believe that without Jupiter, we wouldn't be here, because Jupiter [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7943.84s)]
*  is like a big vacuum cleaner. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7947.679999999999s)]
*  There are scientists that believe that if the moon wasn't as close as it is, that the [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7949.4s)]
*  moon is exactly the same angular diameter as the sun from the Earth. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7953.12s)]
*  Do you know what that implies for you? [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7957.76s)]
*  And next April 8th, when I come and visit you again, there's a total eclipse of the [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7960.08s)]
*  sun. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7964.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7965.5199999999995s)]
*  So I'm going to take you, if you're willing, I'm going to show you the eclipse. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7966.5199999999995s)]
*  That sounds like a lot of fun. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7968.5199999999995s)]
*  It'll change your life. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7969.5199999999995s)]
*  Where would we go? [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7970.5199999999995s)]
*  We're going to go up to San Antonio. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7971.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7972.5199999999995s)]
*  We're going to drive. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7973.5199999999995s)]
*  It's easy. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7974.5199999999995s)]
*  Or a fly. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7975.5199999999995s)]
*  We'll get there. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7976.5199999999995s)]
*  It's only a 90 minute drive. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7977.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not even 90 minutes, right? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7978.5199999999995s)]
*  Have you ever experienced a total solar eclipse? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7979.5199999999995s)]
*  I didn't experience it, because I remember, was it Donald Trump that was staring at the [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7981.84s)]
*  sun? [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7986.08s)]
*  Wasn't it? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7987.08s)]
*  It was him. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7988.08s)]
*  It was him. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7989.08s)]
*  I was like, I'm not going to be that guy. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7990.08s)]
*  I think I did try to look at it. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7991.08s)]
*  Yeah, now that I'm remembering it. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7993.2s)]
*  But it didn't come through here. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7994.52s)]
*  So anyway. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7995.52s)]
*  No, it was in California. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7996.52s)]
*  If you were to see it, the experience that you had on Mauna Kea will seem like you're [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=7997.52s)]
*  just going down to the bar or something. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8003.64s)]
*  Really? [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8005.76s)]
*  This will change your life. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8006.76s)]
*  OK, I'm in. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8007.76s)]
*  This will change your life. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8008.76s)]
*  Damn it, we told everybody we were going to San Antonio on April 8th. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8009.76s)]
*  It's going to be a real problem. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8010.92s)]
*  Well, we'll find a secret place. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8011.92s)]
*  A lot of freaks. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8013.92s)]
*  Freaks are going to show up. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8014.92s)]
*  So the reason I bring that up is because it happens to have the exact, ever seen the far [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8015.92s)]
*  side, there's no dark side of the moon, there's a far side of the moon. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8020.8s)]
*  It's riddled with craters. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8023.52s)]
*  Guess what? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8024.68s)]
*  Each one of those is a target, is a secret service agent that took the bullet for us. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8025.68s)]
*  Any one of those could have exterminated. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8030.68s)]
*  The fact that we did have a huge impact 65 million years ago that led to the advent of [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8033.400000000001s)]
*  the mammals to replace the dinosaurs. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8039.0s)]
*  The fact that we have internal terrestrial magnetism that then allows cosmic radiation [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8042.0s)]
*  to avoid impacting the earth where the population is the largest of all species. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8047.6s)]
*  The auroras are in the north. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8053.56s)]
*  They're not in the equator. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8054.76s)]
*  We don't see them here. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8056.72s)]
*  The existence of plate tectonics, which is lubricated. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8059.2s)]
*  The going theory about plate tectonics, I don't know if you've heard this, but it's [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8063.12s)]
*  actually a lubricant. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8067.32s)]
*  You ever heard of dry graphite is a lubricant that you put in guns or whatever? [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8068.32s)]
*  That the continental shelf is moving over these things. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8073.5199999999995s)]
*  They think that that's a precursor, a requisite for life. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8076.0199999999995s)]
*  Let's do the following very simple calculation. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8079.599999999999s)]
*  Imagine there's eight things. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8081.12s)]
*  You're God. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8083.0s)]
*  You say to have an iPhone, you're going to need eight things. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8084.0s)]
*  I think there's trillions and trillions of things. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8087.24s)]
*  But imagine there's eight of them. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8089.4s)]
*  Imagine each one that the earth has a moon that's just the right distance to have tides [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8091.44s)]
*  to slosh biological material back and forth from the early. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8095.16s)]
*  And that has plate tectonics. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8098.64s)]
*  That's two. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8099.76s)]
*  Has a Jupiter nearby. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8100.76s)]
*  It eventually gets hit by a Chicxulub meteor that kills off the big dinosaurs. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8102.18s)]
*  It has diurnal period that's compatible. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8107.62s)]
*  It has a magnetic. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8110.72s)]
*  Okay, let's just say there's eight of them. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8111.72s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8113.4s)]
*  So each one has a probability in your God-like cosmic roulette wheel of one in a thousand [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8114.4s)]
*  for each one of those eight things to occur. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8120.4s)]
*  One over one thousand. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8123.88s)]
*  Now if you take that, I think it's zero, it's like one over ten trillion for some of these [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8125.68s)]
*  things. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8129.64s)]
*  Now take each one of those. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8130.64s)]
*  So take one over a thousand, raise it to the eighth power. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8131.64s)]
*  You get one ten to the twenty fourth. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8134.64s)]
*  Guess what that number is? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8137.52s)]
*  What? [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8138.52s)]
*  It's the same as the number of stars in the whole universe throughout history. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8139.52s)]
*  So in other words, one thing, only eight different things that had to occur to make life in my [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8142.2s)]
*  simplified God computer that Joe Rogan is controlling. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8147.76s)]
*  The probability of those eight things only is only one part in ten to the twenty fourth. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8151.88s)]
*  Then the problem is you're multiplying a large number by a number that's completely unknown. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8157.16s)]
*  The probability that all these events can line up to make life. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8163.0s)]
*  And you're saying anything times infinity is finite. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8166.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8168.28s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8169.28s)]
*  But we're not necessarily saying that. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8170.28s)]
*  First of all, is it conceivable that there would be solar systems that don't have the [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8173.28s)]
*  sort of asteroid and meteor activity that we do? [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8176.94s)]
*  Of course. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8181.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8182.16s)]
*  So wouldn't they maybe not get as pelted by asteroids and meteors and have more time to [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8183.16s)]
*  develop? [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8189.24s)]
*  Isn't that conceivable that there could be a different kind of if we find so much variety [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8190.24s)]
*  of life, like we talked about the volcanic vents and isn't it possible that there could [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8195.76s)]
*  be other ways that life could form in different environments that may be hostile to biological [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8200.56s)]
*  life on Earth, but not to whatever evolves there? [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8207.2s)]
*  I think we're talking about an infinite number of variables. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8211.68s)]
*  We're talking about so many different planets. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8212.68s)]
*  But why is it that the large number, see again, that's the Carl Sagan, you know, if there's [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8216.28s)]
*  no life in the universe, it's a big awful waste of space. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8221.68s)]
*  But that implies that- [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8224.94s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8225.94s)]
*  I think that's what he said. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8226.94s)]
*  Well, I believe that he said that. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8227.94s)]
*  I'm not saying he didn't say that, but I don't think that way at all. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8229.56s)]
*  I think we're so silly to think that this finite thing that we call biological life [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8232.44s)]
*  is the most significant thing and something that we know is at least 13 whatever billion [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8237.92s)]
*  years old. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8243.92s)]
*  That's so insane that human life, which is just like this never ending cycle of birth [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8245.04s)]
*  and death with this one particular organism, that that thing is the most important thing [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8251.04s)]
*  that's going on in the fucking universe. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8256.56s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8259.88s)]
*  As much as I love people- [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8261.04s)]
*  I know, but you don't have any evidence for that, right? [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8262.04s)]
*  I mean, there's- [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8264.24s)]
*  What do you mean, evidence for what? [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8265.24s)]
*  You can't say that we are not alone. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8266.84s)]
*  Right, you can't say we're not alone. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8268.64s)]
*  It's just the idea that that's the most important thing. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8272.84s)]
*  The biological life is the most important thing. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8275.76s)]
*  Why aren't we the most? [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8277.84s)]
*  I'm coming from a religious perspective, right? [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8278.84s)]
*  I'm going to say that we believe that humans have infinite worth and that we're made in [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8279.84s)]
*  the image of God, that we have God-like abilities. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8285.039999999999s)]
*  How many other God-like things could there be in the universe? [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8288.52s)]
*  Maybe that- Again, I don't want to say that Brian Keating, astrophysicist, believes that [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8291.8s)]
*  there's definitely no life. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8295.5s)]
*  I believe that there could be life. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8296.5s)]
*  In fact, I believe that there is life outside of the earth, but I think it came from the [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8298.14s)]
*  earth. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8301.58s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8302.58s)]
*  Through panspermium. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8303.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8304.58s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8305.58s)]
*  You mean in the whole universe itself that it's come from the earth? [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8306.58s)]
*  Well, even the most- I think you had Adam Frank, professor at University of Rochester [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8308.22s)]
*  on about five or 10 years ago. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8311.98s)]
*  He does the following calculation. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8314.22s)]
*  He basically proves that it's likely that we're not the only technological civilization [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8315.22s)]
*  in the universe over the universe's history. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8319.9s)]
*  I love Adam. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8323.94s)]
*  Who gives a- You know what? [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8324.94s)]
*  You know what he's saying, Joe? [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8326.460000000001s)]
*  Who gives a- Everybody. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8327.460000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8328.460000000001s)]
*  Listen, Joe. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8329.460000000001s)]
*  Listen to what he says. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8330.460000000001s)]
*  I'm listening. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8331.460000000001s)]
*  He said that there was at least one civilization with a probability greater than zero out of [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8332.460000000001s)]
*  the 10 to the 24th power, a trillion, trillion planets and stars in the universe, that there's [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8337.74s)]
*  been one civilization throughout 13.8 billion years. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8344.82s)]
*  That doesn't mean in our solar system. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8347.980000000001s)]
*  It doesn't mean in our galaxy. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8350.2s)]
*  It doesn't mean in Andromeda, the small magi line of clouds. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8351.68s)]
*  It doesn't even mean right now. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8354.24s)]
*  It could be that life could have formed 100 million years after the Big Bang and is gone. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8355.96s)]
*  Is it relevant to you? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8361.119999999999s)]
*  It's unknowable. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8363.02s)]
*  I'm saying what he's saying is at best, it's unknowable because we can't contact the species [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8364.02s)]
*  that's extinct. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8368.72s)]
*  We'll never travel to a place that's beyond a few light years from Earth. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8369.72s)]
*  Then you can say, of course, well, why don't we think that there are more laws of physics [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8374.32s)]
*  than we even know about? [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8377.68s)]
*  Of course, if we lived 100 years ago, we'd think there are two laws of physics. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8378.68s)]
*  I don't want to be arrogant. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8382.0s)]
*  I don't want to say I know for sure. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8383.36s)]
*  That's why I will never say that. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8384.72s)]
*  But I'm saying right now, if you had a bet, if you had a bet and there's some kind of, [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8385.92s)]
*  you would make that bet. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8390.44s)]
*  Yes, there is life. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8391.44s)]
*  And maybe you even bet there's technological life because maybe you believe that there's, [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8393.0s)]
*  you know, that there are extraterrestrial beings that are visiting us or perhaps there [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8396.36s)]
*  could be the possibility. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8399.32s)]
*  You would say yes. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8400.96s)]
*  I would say no. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8401.96s)]
*  And I would say based on what evidence can you say that there's life outside of the Earth? [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8402.96s)]
*  I'd say right now there's zero evidence. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8406.48s)]
*  You would have to admit that, right? [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8408.42s)]
*  There's no evidence. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8409.42s)]
*  There's no evidence. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8410.42s)]
*  It's not a lack of evidence. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8411.460000000001s)]
*  It's not evidence that it doesn't exist. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8412.460000000001s)]
*  That's absolutely true. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8413.460000000001s)]
*  So when you are seeing all this UAP disclosure talk and all that stuff, what is your take [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8415.1s)]
*  on this stuff? [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8421.02s)]
*  So I've talked to people, Ryan Graves, who you've had on. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8422.1s)]
*  I've talked to, I actually did a podcast with his wingman, one of his former Navy pilot [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8425.9s)]
*  wingman. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8429.58s)]
*  I listened to it. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8430.58s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8431.58s)]
*  It was very good. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8432.58s)]
*  Yeah, I shouldn't have said thanks before you said it was good. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8433.58s)]
*  It was very good. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8434.58s)]
*  It was very, very interesting. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8435.58s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8436.58s)]
*  I'll put that on my resume. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8437.58s)]
*  So we talked and remember earlier, like two hours ago, I was going to ask you for advice [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8438.74s)]
*  and I'm such a blabbermouth, I didn't get to ask you for advice as a podcaster. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8442.74s)]
*  The advice I wanted to ask you is when you're talking to somebody and for one reason or [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8446.74s)]
*  another, maybe it's your past history, maybe it's researches you've done independently [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8450.74s)]
*  that even an expert hasn't done and you're thinking this person's wrong, this person's [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8453.74s)]
*  making a mistake. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8458.74s)]
*  Has that ever happened to you? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8459.74s)]
*  And if so, how do you deal with that as a podcast? [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8460.74s)]
*  I think it's a good question. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8462.74s)]
*  This person's making a mistake. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8463.9s)]
*  Has that ever happened to you? [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8465.9s)]
*  And if so, how do you deal with that as a podcaster? [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8466.9s)]
*  It's complicated. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8469.78s)]
*  I mean, I always do or try to do my very best to let someone express himself fully before [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8470.78s)]
*  I interject. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8477.02s)]
*  But there are some times we have to say that's not true. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8479.1s)]
*  What you're saying has been disproven and this is like we should show how it's been [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8483.02s)]
*  disproven. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8488.34s)]
*  Or you could be talking about something that I'm an expert in. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8489.94s)]
*  Like if someone wants to bring, like UFC for example, if somebody wants to say, if you [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8494.42s)]
*  wanted to fight in the UFC, all you need to do is learn kung fu. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8500.7s)]
*  If someone said that, I'd be like, you're out of your mind. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8503.460000000001s)]
*  Or it's as fake as wrestling. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8506.1s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8507.1s)]
*  You could say you're totally full of it. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8508.1s)]
*  Well, that's someone that's delusional. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8509.1s)]
*  I mean, anybody who watches the fight's not gonna be real. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8510.1s)]
*  But if someone had like this very distorted perspective on something that I know a lot [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8514.66s)]
*  about, yeah, maybe I would be like that you shouldn't say that because this is why that's [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8519.86s)]
*  not accurate. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8524.78s)]
*  So I'm talking to Ryan Graves and I've talked to Lieutenant Ann Dietrich, who is the wing [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8525.78s)]
*  woman I guess you'd say of Commander David Fravor, who you've had on. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8530.66s)]
*  I've talked to them and I've talked to them. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8535.06s)]
*  Okay, look, I'm a pilot. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8537.94s)]
*  I feel a little suss in this room. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8539.26s)]
*  It's not gonna be like, you know, I'm talking to super hornet pilots. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8540.54s)]
*  I'm like a schmuck, right? [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8543.06s)]
*  But when you see things like, I'm told, like, I can't question that because I didn't serve [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8545.46s)]
*  in the military. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8549.52s)]
*  Or they have great hand-eye coordination or they're trained observers. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8550.52s)]
*  I actually know, my flight instructor told me a couple of things. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8553.76s)]
*  He said to me, he said, you relying on hand-eye coordination or you relying on your innate [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8556.56s)]
*  abilities as a pilot or your ability to perceive things is gonna get you killed. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8562.32s)]
*  And he wasn't like some military pilot, I don't know what my stepfather was, but the [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8568.08s)]
*  point being you're trained to ignore your senses and pay attention to your instruments. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8571.32s)]
*  Therefore the human factor is irrelevant. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8576.48s)]
*  Like the fact that he can land on an F-18 on a carrier at night in the middle of a typhoon [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8578.96s)]
*  doesn't have anything to do with the fact that like he is not necessarily better at [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8584.16s)]
*  judging evidence versus me as a scientist or even as a lay person. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8587.8s)]
*  Okay. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8591.84s)]
*  Okay. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8592.84s)]
*  So we're talking and then I hear things like, well, he witnessed this or he saw this or [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8593.84s)]
*  he has data about this. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8597.64s)]
*  And by the way, he's been to my house. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8599.279999999999s)]
*  I've had him for Shabbat dinner. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8600.8s)]
*  And I like Ryan a lot and I like Andy Tricke and the flavor sounds are great. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8602.96s)]
*  When you hear them say things and then they will say things like you and Eric talked about, [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8607.599999999999s)]
*  they're defying the laws of physics or these things cannot occur within what we understand [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8612.72s)]
*  about physics. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8616.8s)]
*  They're not physicists and I'm not a pilot, but we can use our various skills. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8618.16s)]
*  When I see things like he saw this, no, he didn't see it. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8623.08s)]
*  He didn't claim to see it. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8626.72s)]
*  Even in your interview. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8628.08s)]
*  Ryan Graves did. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8629.08s)]
*  He didn't see anything with his eyes. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8630.16s)]
*  He saw things on radar with a system that was newly upgraded in the super Hornet Mark [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8631.16s)]
*  D that he was flying. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8635.52s)]
*  Okay. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8636.52s)]
*  Recently upgraded. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8637.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8638.52s)]
*  Doesn't mean it didn't happen. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8639.52s)]
*  Fravor and Dietrich when they were flying, they saw things and they tried to perceive [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8640.52s)]
*  them from great altitude, something the size of a school bus and how fast it was moving [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8646.52s)]
*  relative to the ground. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8650.64s)]
*  Okay. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8651.64s)]
*  Then there's data. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8652.64s)]
*  Then there's things from the Princeton. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8653.64s)]
*  So I've looked into these things. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8654.64s)]
*  I know the limitations. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8655.64s)]
*  I know a lot about radio technology, radar sensing. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8656.64s)]
*  So I don't think that being a military pilot, as much as I don't have the balls to do what [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8660.64s)]
*  any of them do, and I never had the guts to sign up to the military, though I might have [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8664.08s)]
*  liked to, doesn't mean that we accept what they say uncritically. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8667.92s)]
*  And in Ryan's case, I find it unpersuasive. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8673.92s)]
*  I don't mean to say that it's not important. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8676.599999999999s)]
*  It's very important, very significant what he's doing because I think at best, at worst [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8678.859999999999s)]
*  could save the lives of pilots. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8684.56s)]
*  If it's some Chinese spy balloon, it could be American Psi-Op. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8685.88s)]
*  It could be doing all sorts of things or Grush. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8688.92s)]
*  I don't know if you've talked to him. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8690.92s)]
*  I haven't talked to him. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8691.92s)]
*  You know, claiming non-human biologics, which is like, you know, non-cow animal. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8692.92s)]
*  Okay. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8697.4s)]
*  What is that? [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8698.4s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8699.4s)]
*  Is it a slime mold? [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8700.4s)]
*  You know, my favorite thing. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8701.4s)]
*  What did you think of the Fravor video evidence? [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8702.4s)]
*  So this is the tic tac or the... [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8704.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8706.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8707.72s)]
*  So this is going back to 2004. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8708.72s)]
*  By the way, all these things occur in military... [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8711.2s)]
*  Proponents of military areas. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8713.28s)]
*  Very important point. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8715.68s)]
*  What's happening with Ryan, and I've flown through that area. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8716.68s)]
*  You know, you can fly through it. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8718.720000000001s)]
*  If I take you up my little Cessna, I will fly you through this warning area. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8719.84s)]
*  It's not something like secret thing where Area 51 is blowing up stuff or nuking alien [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8723.12s)]
*  artifacts. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8727.84s)]
*  Is there restricted airspace out there though? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8728.84s)]
*  You're not allowed to travel in it. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8729.84s)]
*  It's a warning area, which means that if you go into it, you could be intercepted, but [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8730.84s)]
*  for fun. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8735.04s)]
*  Not for fun, for training. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8736.04s)]
*  So what an F-18 will do... [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8737.36s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8738.36s)]
*  They're going to practice on you? [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8739.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8740.68s)]
*  That's how they train their radar systems. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8741.68s)]
*  Oh my God, they got to practice on you if you fly your little fucking propeller plane. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8743.16s)]
*  Do you know how horrifying that would be? [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8747.720000000001s)]
*  If those dudes just buzzed up on you in a fighter jet. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8751.24s)]
*  Those guys are serious killers. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8754.480000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, and those things are so fucking fast. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8755.68s)]
*  They're fast. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8758.2s)]
*  I flew with the Blue Angels once. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8759.2s)]
*  You did? [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8760.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was amazing. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8761.52s)]
*  It was awesome. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8762.52s)]
*  It was amazing. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8763.52s)]
*  Did you puke? [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8764.52s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8765.52s)]
*  I did puke. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8766.52s)]
*  I did puke, and I was so embarrassed because I'd gotten through seven and a half Gs and [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8767.52s)]
*  I made it from hooking. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8769.320000000002s)]
*  The thing you do, you're hooking. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8771.320000000002s)]
*  You're forcing blood into your brain. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8773.320000000002s)]
*  I did that at seven and a half Gs, and then I failed to do it on a lesser turn, and I [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8775.12s)]
*  blacked out. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8780.84s)]
*  You blacked out. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8781.84s)]
*  Tito Ortiz. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8782.84s)]
*  I just fucked up. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8783.84s)]
*  No, it wasn't like that. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8784.84s)]
*  His was crazy. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8785.84s)]
*  He was in one of those... [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8786.84s)]
*  Centripetal. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8787.84s)]
*  Yeah, that thing's insane. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8788.84s)]
*  What I did was... [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8790.44s)]
*  I could have survived that one easier. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8792.04s)]
*  It was not as bad, but I didn't do it in time. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8794.44s)]
*  It came upon me so quick, and then when I came out of it, I threw up. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8797.04s)]
*  This guy Hazard Lee, he's a great... [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8799.92s)]
*  It's wild because it's like an elevator door. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8802.68s)]
*  You see the black closing on the sides, literally like an elevator door. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8805.76s)]
*  It's almost like you're forcing the door open, like hoot, hoot, hoot. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8811.64s)]
*  When you're doing that, you're forcing that blood into your head, and it keeps you conscious. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8814.92s)]
*  Have you ever been knocked out? [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8818.16s)]
*  No, never been unconscious. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8819.16s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8820.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8821.16s)]
*  I haven't either, thankfully, but my kids are getting bigger. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8822.16s)]
*  But everybody can be. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8823.16s)]
*  Everybody can be. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8824.16s)]
*  I just haven't been hit the right way by the right person. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8825.16s)]
*  That's right. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8827.36s)]
*  Thank God. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8828.36s)]
*  I've seen a lot of them. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8829.36s)]
*  The point is that if you're dealing with... [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8831.44s)]
*  That kind of speed is fucking insane. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8835.36s)]
*  The thing that they're describing, that Ryan Graves is describing, is something that's [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8838.039999999999s)]
*  able to stay stationary at 120 knots of wind. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8841.2s)]
*  The thing that the Commander Fravor and what their radar detected was that this thing had [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8844.52s)]
*  gone from 50,000 feet to 50 feet in a second. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8849.68s)]
*  What would happen if that happened? [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8853.56s)]
*  If you're actually holding right over there, what would happen if that happened? [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8855.04s)]
*  Any kind of material traveling through the Earth's atmosphere at such a speed would be [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8857.92s)]
*  at least illuminated and at least probably be incinerated. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8862.44s)]
*  But okay, so then the argument becomes, well, maybe they have advanced metamaterials that [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8866.6s)]
*  we don't have access to. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8869.96s)]
*  Okay, so you can keep adding things onto it, which is exactly, by the way, what this guy [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8870.96s)]
*  Gupta in the Galaxy thing did. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8874.28s)]
*  He keeps adding... [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8876.12s)]
*  If you keep adding parameters to your theory in order to make it fit, observations otherwise [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8877.12s)]
*  don't go well. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8881.48s)]
*  These observations backed by data, and this data is from these very advanced military [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8882.52s)]
*  detection systems that did detect this physical object that was witnessed by two fighter jets, [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8888.84s)]
*  isn't another possibility that there's some method of propulsion that doesn't... [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8894.64s)]
*  It's not propulsion at all. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8899.8s)]
*  Instead, it's manipulating gravity, manipulating whatever the fuck it's doing to go from one [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8901.76s)]
*  point in space to another point in space almost instantaneously, but not biological, not like [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8908.96s)]
*  a physical thing inside of it. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8915.24s)]
*  I'm talking about like a drone. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8917.0s)]
*  Okay, so the reason you've heard it, or I mentioned this Chicxulub, which is the meteor [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8918.48s)]
*  crater off the Yucatan Peninsula, that was the theory in which that was kind of unveiled [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8922.599999999999s)]
*  was a physicist, nuclear physicist, Nobel Prize winner named Luis Alvarez, who plays [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8927.599999999999s)]
*  a small role in Oppenheimer that you'll see, and that he was responsible for radar in World [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8931.199999999999s)]
*  War II as part of one of his jobs. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8938.28s)]
*  And he realized something that they could do. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8940.8s)]
*  So radar works by interrogating an object with radio frequency waves that travel at [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8943.16s)]
*  the speed of light and bounce off an object, and you can get timing between when they get [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8949.08s)]
*  bounced off and when it comes back, and you can measure the distance to them, and you [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8954.88s)]
*  can measure the speed if you get a couple of those measurements. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8957.76s)]
*  That's how radar works. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8959.72s)]
*  And it's totally similar in concept to what you described with the advanced military instrument. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8961.36s)]
*  Luis Alvarez was a creative, incredibly brilliant scientist. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8967.0s)]
*  When he was working on that plan, he knew that the Germans and the Japanese could have [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8971.2s)]
*  similar technology, and in fact they were starting to develop it. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8974.64s)]
*  It turns out the Allies were good at not only the Manhattan Project, but they were good [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8977.64s)]
*  at developing radar, and both were the technologies that were crucial. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8980.56s)]
*  But the Germans were developing it too. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8983.76s)]
*  He realized that there's something called the inverse square law, which is that the [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8985.84s)]
*  signal gets weaker not as the distance away from it, but it gets diminished by the distance [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8988.6s)]
*  to the second power, meaning that if, as you go away from something, the gravitational [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8993.42s)]
*  force that you feel if I double the distance is four times lower. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=8997.58s)]
*  That's Newton's law of gravity. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9001.34s)]
*  The gravity force decreases as inverse square. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9002.78s)]
*  It also holds for radar reflections. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9005.5s)]
*  So Alvarez said, I could spoof the Germans by intentionally, when they send me a signal, [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9007.86s)]
*  I'm going to send them a signal when I'm coming closer to them. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9012.82s)]
*  I'm going to take their signal, I'm going to diminish it, I'm going to shoot it back [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9015.42s)]
*  exactly as the inverse square, because he knew how far away they were too. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9018.22s)]
*  So he spoofed them, and he transmitted the signal. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9022.36s)]
*  So even though he was getting closer, they thought, oh, nothing to worry about, he's [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9025.640000000001s)]
*  getting farther away. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9028.42s)]
*  And then the planes would blow up the radar sites, and then they'd be blind. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9029.54s)]
*  And now that's just one example. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9033.52s)]
*  Now what would the German radar operator have said? [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9035.84s)]
*  That object defied the laws of physics. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9039.12s)]
*  It was getting closer, but my radar showed it getting farther away. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9041.66s)]
*  I'm not saying that's what happened, Joe, but haven't I provoked a little bit of a doubt [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9044.7s)]
*  that maybe there could be other explanations other than alien technology? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9049.08s)]
*  In other words, you combined them. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9052.72s)]
*  I don't necessarily think it's alien. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9054.32s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9056.839999999998s)]
*  I think it's, no, I think there's a real issue with it being in these areas of heavy military [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9058.96s)]
*  activity. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9064.72s)]
*  And I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that the United States has developed [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9066.119999999999s)]
*  some black ops secret project where they've figured out a way to do something with drones [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9069.74s)]
*  that's unprecedented. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9076.48s)]
*  That I think there's just- [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9078.96s)]
*  But then why is it- [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9080.96s)]
*  When they're talking about it openly, as soon as they start talking about it openly, crafts [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9081.96s)]
*  out of this world, I smell bullshit. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9087.279999999999s)]
*  Like I've said it multiple times on the show, there's something about this that doesn't [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9091.48s)]
*  feel real. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9095.939999999999s)]
*  And I also gave myself the possibility that maybe if disclosure did happen, it would be [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9097.4s)]
*  so preposterous and so strange and alien just in the idea that there's life outside [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9103.0s)]
*  this planet and that it's more advanced than us and that it's been visiting us forever. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9108.04s)]
*  Maybe that would feel so fake because it's so crazy that it's almost impossible. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9112.78s)]
*  There would be no context other than fiction movies. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9118.12s)]
*  So I wouldn't be able to fit it in anywhere and it would seem fake. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9121.76s)]
*  But that's not what I'm getting out of this. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9125.44s)]
*  When I'm watching all this, I'm like, man, I feel like someone's lying to me. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9127.4s)]
*  I feel like I'm being duped. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9131.64s)]
*  You know what- [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9133.64s)]
*  And I don't know why. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9134.64s)]
*  You know what really spoke to me, and I felt sorry because again, I have a Metfavor and [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9135.64s)]
*  he seems like a patriot and again, he's got bigger balls than I do. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9138.92s)]
*  When he got back to the carrier, do you know what they kept doing? [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9142.68s)]
*  Yeah, they're fucking with him saying he saw UFOs. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9145.199999999999s)]
*  But a lot of those guys had seen them and they not just seen them like one time, they'd [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9147.38s)]
*  seen many of them. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9152.039999999999s)]
*  And I just have this idea that if they were going to do something with some really advanced [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9153.96s)]
*  wouldn't they do in restricted airspace where the fucking military operates all the time? [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9159.92s)]
*  Of course, is it weird that it's happening off the coast of Virginia and also off the [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9163.800000000001s)]
*  coast of San Diego where there's massive- [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9168.36s)]
*  Warning areas, yeah. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9169.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is like, it seems to me that that's more likely. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9170.880000000001s)]
*  But then again, then there's these instances of people encountering these things and the [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9175.12s)]
*  concept of inter-dimensional travel, whatever that means, whatever inter-dimensional travel. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9182.800000000001s)]
*  I know Grush tried to sort of explain that in some sort of a strange way and physicists [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9188.24s)]
*  pulled it apart and said, this doesn't make sense. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9192.84s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9195.28s)]
*  But the concept of exposing other, like wasn't there some, what was this? [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9196.56s)]
*  Let me find, there's something I saved that I wanted to bring up with you. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9203.08s)]
*  Some, God, was it like a new, I'll find it. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9207.64s)]
*  The point being that there was some new discovery that could lead to the possibility of travel [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9214.28s)]
*  to other dimensions or at least detecting other dimensions in a way that we could conceivably [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9222.080000000002s)]
*  prove that there is something else outside of what we're physically capable of experiencing. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9229.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, you're absolutely right. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9235.12s)]
*  And that beings could come from there. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9236.52s)]
*  Okay, that's- [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9238.320000000002s)]
*  That's where it gets, that's next level. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9239.320000000002s)]
*  That's a wormhole too far. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9240.640000000001s)]
*  But it is true. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9243.0s)]
*  In fact, when I said the inverse square law, that is a very, very accurate way- [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9244.0s)]
*  Want to find that? [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9248.8s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9249.8s)]
*  I'll just talk about this. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9250.8s)]
*  Please do. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9251.8s)]
*  In a higher dimensional space than three spatial dimensions plus one time dimension that we [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9252.8s)]
*  enjoy- [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9256.8s)]
*  I found it. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9257.8s)]
*  The light and or gravity would decrease with an exponent greater than two. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9258.8s)]
*  And so these black holes that crash together and release gravitational wave energy, again, [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9263.4s)]
*  my friend David Spirgel, they've been able to set limits on the dimensionality of space [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9267.8s)]
*  and it's very, very close to three dimensions of space and from an object that's a billion [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9272.24s)]
*  light years away, Joe. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9276.92s)]
*  So yes, beyond that anything goes and but go ahead with your research. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9278.0s)]
*  I sent it to Jamie. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9281.960000000001s)]
*  This is the thing. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9283.24s)]
*  It's definitely not my research. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9284.24s)]
*  New for- fucking pop ups. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9286.4s)]
*  New force of nature. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9288.56s)]
*  Scientists close it on a fifth force. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9289.8s)]
*  So what is this? [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9292.12s)]
*  They discover mysterious subatomic particles disobeying the laws of physics. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9293.12s)]
*  I just want to look at your face when you get incredibly let down. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9296.2s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9298.960000000001s)]
*  Yes, let me down. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9299.960000000001s)]
*  So when we talk about forces of nature, so there are four main forces of nature, gravity [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9301.96s)]
*  that we're familiar with, right? [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9307.439999999999s)]
*  And then there's the electric force and then there's the magnetic force and then there's [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9309.4s)]
*  two types of nuclear force. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9313.32s)]
*  One is called the weak nuclear force. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9314.679999999998s)]
*  That's like radioactive decay. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9316.199999999999s)]
*  And then there's a strong nuclear force that's responsible for things like fusion and so [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9317.199999999999s)]
*  forth. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9321.72s)]
*  When we look at these particles, we say for each type of force, there's a corresponding [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9323.359999999999s)]
*  object that responds to that force, say it could be mass like matter like we're made [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9328.48s)]
*  up of, and there's a boson and the boson communicates the force to that massive object. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9332.08s)]
*  So the Higgs boson is what gives particles mass and that's the mechanism by which we [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9338.52s)]
*  acquire mass and inertia, resistance to motion. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9343.4s)]
*  Electro-isidion magnetism. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9347.28s)]
*  They're communicated by a boson called the photon. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9348.28s)]
*  The photon is the gauge carrying force that propagates the interaction between magnetic [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9351.039999999999s)]
*  fields, electric fields, charges. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9357.08s)]
*  And then there's strong and weak nuclear forces. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9359.28s)]
*  This is saying that there seems to be a new calculation, a new data that's been discovered [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9363.12s)]
*  in what are called muons. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9369.2s)]
*  And these muons have a relationship between their charge and their spin. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9370.88s)]
*  And that charge-spin relationship for one reason or another should be exactly in a ratio [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9375.84s)]
*  of two. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9379.88s)]
*  So their spin versus their magnetic type of property to their spin. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9381.08s)]
*  And so this little dreidel, one of your last pieces of gifts here. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9385.36s)]
*  So there it goes there. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9390.6s)]
*  Not a dreidel. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9391.6s)]
*  It's a top. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9392.6s)]
*  See how long you can get that to spin for. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9393.6s)]
*  Okay, so what they're showing is that, so see how the thing is not only spinning on [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9395.84s)]
*  its axis, but the axis is moving around, Joe? [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9399.560000000001s)]
*  That's called precession. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9402.08s)]
*  That precession for a muon you can think of as a little tiny spinning top also. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9403.480000000001s)]
*  And that will have a special relationship between its magnetic properties as it's spinning [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9408.28s)]
*  to its physical angular momentum, which is what this thing is doing. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9412.8s)]
*  So like the precession of the equinoxes. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9416.0s)]
*  Exactly wrong. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9419.439999999999s)]
*  No, no, yes, I think you're right. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9420.439999999999s)]
*  It's still going. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9421.439999999999s)]
*  No, it's true. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9422.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9423.439999999999s)]
*  Okay, and now I'm going to do something else for you. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9424.439999999999s)]
*  Okay, so you got that to spin for like, I will give you $100,000 if you can get this [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9426.0s)]
*  thing to spin in both directions over 20 times. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9432.359999999999s)]
*  This thing? [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9437.56s)]
*  This thing. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9438.56s)]
*  That's all I want you to do. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9439.56s)]
*  So each direction. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9440.56s)]
*  What is this thing? [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9441.56s)]
*  I'm going to spin it in a crashed UFO. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9443.48s)]
*  20 times? [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9444.48s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9445.48s)]
*  No. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9446.48s)]
*  No, that didn't count. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9447.48s)]
*  You can keep trying. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9448.48s)]
*  I'll give you as many tries as you want. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9449.48s)]
*  Okay, that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9450.48s)]
*  Now do the other way. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9452.32s)]
*  Try it again. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9453.32s)]
*  What's the best way to do it? [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9454.32s)]
*  I'm not going to tell you. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9455.32s)]
*  I'm not going to give you 100 grand. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9456.32s)]
*  I'm just trying to... [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9457.32s)]
*  I don't have Spotify money. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9458.32s)]
*  That was the original way you did it. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9463.32s)]
*  Now do it the other way. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9464.8s)]
*  Okay. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9465.8s)]
*  Do it counterclockwise. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9466.8s)]
*  We're getting better at it. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9467.8s)]
*  Can't do it. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9468.8s)]
*  Why is that? [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9469.8s)]
*  Look at it. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9472.039999999999s)]
*  Is it symmetrical? [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9473.039999999999s)]
*  Isn't that cool? [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9474.039999999999s)]
*  There's nothing crazy about it. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9475.039999999999s)]
*  It's called a rattle back. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9477.039999999999s)]
*  That thing has symmetry about more than one axis, such that when you spin it in the direction [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9479.8s)]
*  clockwise, it'll spin forever, like the dreidel. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9484.8s)]
*  But if you try to spin it the other way, it stops and goes back because there's torque [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9487.359999999999s)]
*  being... [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9492.679999999998s)]
*  But that is the other way. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9493.679999999998s)]
*  That's counterclockwise. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9494.679999999998s)]
*  That's the first way. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9495.679999999998s)]
*  Now do it the other way. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9496.679999999998s)]
*  That's counterclockwise. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9497.679999999998s)]
*  Okay, stop. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9498.679999999998s)]
*  Do it the other way. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9499.679999999998s)]
*  See? [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9500.679999999998s)]
*  Isn't that cool? [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9502.56s)]
*  But to the ordinary eye, if I just showed you this... [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9503.56s)]
*  It stops and starts going the other direction. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9505.56s)]
*  It stops and goes the other direction. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9506.56s)]
*  So muons will have this property that they don't have this exact relationship that's [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9507.56s)]
*  predicted by theory. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9510.84s)]
*  Again, this is what scientists do. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9511.84s)]
*  They have a model for how nature should behave. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9513.48s)]
*  We make observations. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9515.2s)]
*  Now those observations disagree at a very significant level, such that the odds of it [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9516.6s)]
*  occurring by fluke chance is about one in 30 million or something like that. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9520.76s)]
*  And so now they're saying the one way to explain it is if there's another type of boson, which [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9525.56s)]
*  would mean another type of force, which would be the fifth force for those caping squire [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9530.240000000002s)]
*  at home. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9534.84s)]
*  So that's all that means. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9535.84s)]
*  It doesn't mean that there's a wormhole and that they're communicating through it. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9536.84s)]
*  There are theories like that, but not for the muon experiment. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9540.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9543.240000000002s)]
*  What do you... [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9544.240000000002s)]
*  Could you bring it back to the UAB thing? [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9545.240000000002s)]
*  What do you think is going on? [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9547.44s)]
*  Well, the Occam's razor approach is to think about it as maybe it's a variety of sources. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9549.480000000001s)]
*  First of all, Grouch, where is he from? [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9557.6s)]
*  Grouch, sorry. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9560.56s)]
*  I don't know if it's he. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9561.56s)]
*  And I'd love to talk to him. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9562.56s)]
*  He seems like an interesting patriotic guy. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9563.56s)]
*  Well, he doesn't have physical experience with anything. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9565.24s)]
*  He doesn't even have direct eyewitness. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9568.24s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9569.72s)]
*  He wasn't... [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9570.72s)]
*  But he's not claiming he does. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9571.72s)]
*  What he's claiming is that he uncovered these programs that he thinks as a patriotic American [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9573.56s)]
*  and as a citizen of the world, that people should know that there's crash retrieval programs [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9578.8s)]
*  and that they are in possession of biological entities that they keep in freezers. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9583.58s)]
*  Again, I don't want to condemn him. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9588.76s)]
*  I don't want to have any smattering of an ad hominem attack, but I'll say one thing. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9590.72s)]
*  And just you tell me if I'm being an a-hole, okay? [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9595.72s)]
*  He was given the opportunity on perhaps the greatest stage he'll ever have to name names [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9598.279999999999s)]
*  and to say different things. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9602.4s)]
*  And he didn't name them. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9603.56s)]
*  And I've heard things from like Lou Alzahn indirectly. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9604.6s)]
*  My friend Kurt Jemungle has talked to him many times. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9607.52s)]
*  But I've never talked to him. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9610.08s)]
*  But they'll say things like, I can't do that. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9613.18s)]
*  It'll ruin my life. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9615.68s)]
*  I'm a coward compared to both of these gentlemen, right? [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9618.04s)]
*  But at a certain level in front of senators, congressmen, women, to say like, I can't disclose [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9621.24s)]
*  that. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9628.16s)]
*  But you're a whistleblower. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9629.16s)]
*  Like, you're blowing a whistle. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9630.16s)]
*  You have protection. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9631.68s)]
*  We will protect you. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9632.68s)]
*  We will defend the frick out of you. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9633.68s)]
*  Yes. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9634.880000000001s)]
*  But he's not done. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9635.880000000001s)]
*  What he's trying to do is get permission to discuss more things. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9636.92s)]
*  So he has permission to say what he said so far. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9640.84s)]
*  This is according to him. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9643.28s)]
*  He is attempting to get permission to discuss more. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9645.48s)]
*  These are the things that he could have discussed with them in the skiff. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9649.359999999999s)]
*  That's why he brought it up this way. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9652.119999999999s)]
*  He's trying to do this all by the book. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9653.48s)]
*  And it appears that there's both resistance and support for this. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9656.08s)]
*  Well, this is the argument I had with Avi Loeb when he came on my show. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9660.48s)]
*  He talked about this object, Oumuamua, which is this interstellar object that he claims [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9664.439999999999s)]
*  is either junk debris or maybe it's a tourist scout or a spy drone. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9668.84s)]
*  It's much more reflective, rather, right? [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9673.0s)]
*  It has properties that can't be explained by the typical astronomical, pedantic ways [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9675.68s)]
*  of explaining things. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9679.68s)]
*  And I told him when he came on my podcast, and I love Avi, I've had him on many times, [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9681.28s)]
*  I said, Avi, you know, you happen to also be friendly because I said, would you go, [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9684.52s)]
*  why don't you go after this thing and go track it down? [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9689.880000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, he said. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9692.12s)]
*  In a couple of years, one of the most ambitious and important observatories is coming online. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9694.24s)]
*  And I'm happy to recommend people that work on it to you when it comes out called the [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9698.640000000001s)]
*  Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9701.880000000001s)]
*  Not too far from where my Simon, our Simon's Observatory is. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9704.400000000001s)]
*  And that observatory, he said, is going to capture thousands of these things, if I'm right. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9707.12s)]
*  And I said, Avi, what if you're wrong? [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9711.44s)]
*  You know, what if, what if this is one time only event? [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9713.640000000001s)]
*  I said, Avi, I live in San Diego and San Diego has the following properties. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9716.44s)]
*  It's the absolute best and easiest place to be a meteorologist on the planet, [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9722.0s)]
*  except for yesterday, a freaking hurricane and a tornado and an earthquake. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9726.76s)]
*  But it's the absolute worst place to be a sportscaster because we, of all the major cities [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9732.36s)]
*  in the United States, we have never won a world championship in any sport. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9737.560000000001s)]
*  OK, so it's horrible. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9741.52s)]
*  So last year, then the Padres got into the division series. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9742.800000000001s)]
*  I'm a huge Padres fan. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9746.36s)]
*  I should not have said, well, the Padres are in the division series, even though it's the first time, [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9748.560000000001s)]
*  you know, and since 19 since Tony Gwynn was playing and they've been around for 55 years. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9754.36s)]
*  I'll just wait till next year. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9759.44s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. I made every I try to get tickets. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9761.12s)]
*  I scouting. I couldn't get tickets because you don't know if your calculations are correct. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9763.880000000001s)]
*  But if you believe in what you're saying, track this thing down. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9768.960000000001s)]
*  And oh, by the way, Avi, you happen to know a guy named Yuri Milner who's already paying your team [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9772.160000000002s)]
*  and funding you, not personally. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9778.160000000002s)]
*  He's funding a team called the Breakthrough Starshot. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9779.640000000001s)]
*  Have you heard about this? No. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9782.800000000001s)]
*  They're going to send billions of little cell phone cameras to Proxima Centauri B. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9784.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to laugh. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9791.84s)]
*  Anyway, they're spending 100 million dollars on it and they're going to shoot these things there [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9794.480000000001s)]
*  and they'll get there in 20 years and they'll transmit at the speed of light. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9798.480000000001s)]
*  It'll take another four years to get back to the earth because four light years away. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9801.880000000001s)]
*  Instead of having him spend 100 million on that, why don't you get him to, you know, [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9805.6s)]
*  get a little CubeSat and shoot it off and go catch up to Oumuamua while it's still in your freaking neighborhood. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9809.44s)]
*  So that's totally possible to do? Totally possible. It's not. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9813.800000000001s)]
*  So you think he's resisting that because it doesn't, like he doesn't want it to be disproven [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9816.6s)]
*  because he's getting a lot of attention off of this idea that this is this interstellar object [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9821.960000000001s)]
*  is something from an alien civilization. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9826.28s)]
*  I think that's too venal. I don't think he's doing it for attention. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9828.04s)]
*  I just think he's too in love with his numbers. He's too in love with his calculation. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9831.720000000001s)]
*  Too in love with the idea. But there's so many of them. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9835.560000000001s)]
*  There is a temptation. There has to be a temptation to get him recognition [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9838.04s)]
*  because I had never heard of him until a few years ago and now I hear about him constantly. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9841.32s)]
*  He's in all these interviews and this is not disparaging. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9845.72s)]
*  No, no, no. It's just that there's a there's an impulse that people have to [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9849.24s)]
*  continue to do something that gets them a lot of recognition. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9852.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, sure. I mean, this is this is the number one. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9854.92s)]
*  If it's possible to go take a look at that thing, how much would it cost to go take a look at that thing? [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9859.0s)]
*  I would probably cost less than a billion dollars saying and this guy that he's friends with is [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9863.48s)]
*  and far be it for me to tell a billionaire how it's been his or money. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9867.72s)]
*  But I'm just saying I don't think you're going to talk Elon Musk into going looking at it. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9871.08s)]
*  Right. Well, he was another kid. So I know you've you've thought so you have this piece of Mars. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9874.12s)]
*  Right. So he's trying to get to Mars now. Right. He wants to die on Mars. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9878.52s)]
*  And hopefully, God willing, it won't be on impact. OK. That would be horrible if he dies on him. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9881.560000000001s)]
*  But Joe, I've ever thought like, which one of his 10 kids? [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9887.080000000002s)]
*  I mean, can I know he's got 10 kids? Who's going to leave behind? [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9891.080000000002s)]
*  Like who like to do that goes to Mars. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9895.080000000002s)]
*  I think he's like he wants to go to Mars. He said he wants to die on Mars. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9898.84s)]
*  By the time he is able to do this, I'll probably be fully grown adults. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9902.12s)]
*  I think I'll visit him. They go come come with him. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9906.2s)]
*  Apparently, the idea is to be able to come back. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9908.52s)]
*  Just like, OK, I saw the Martian. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9911.560000000001s)]
*  Did you like that? Yeah, I love the Mars. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9914.84s)]
*  Andy Weir is a UCSD. He didn't graduate from UCSD, but he wrote it. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9916.52s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9920.92s)]
*  it is possible that one day we will have the technology to colonize other planets. Right. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9925.320000000002s)]
*  Do we have the do we have the reason to do it, Joe? [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9931.24s)]
*  What is the reason? This is what I want. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9934.84s)]
*  Sometimes the reason just to be able to do it or maybe to ensure that human race survives. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9937.48s)]
*  If there's some sort of a natural disaster on Earth. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9943.64s)]
*  Do you know what Nixon wrote on the plaque that went to the moon on Apollo 11? [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9945.800000000001s)]
*  Know what said we came in peace for all mankind. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9949.48s)]
*  It's all bullshit. Right. It was a war against the Soviets. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9952.44s)]
*  It was part of the Cold War as a war of propaganda. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9955.24s)]
*  And it was important. I did a lot for science. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9957.24s)]
*  Guess what? We haven't been back to the moon. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9958.6s)]
*  In 50 years. Right. So if it was so important for peace and for technology, why are we in the back? [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9960.68s)]
*  OK, so to say what we did, it's the Edmund Hillary thing, you know, [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9965.56s)]
*  climate, Everest, because it's there. Right. But but Elon has said the following. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9968.92s)]
*  He has said, I want to go to Mars so that humankind becomes interplanetary. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9973.0s)]
*  Then you ask. I love to keep asking why questions. Right. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9978.84s)]
*  Those are so annoying. Like your kids keep asking you why. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9981.4s)]
*  You know what the ultimate answer is? Because I freaking said so. Go to sleep. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9983.48s)]
*  Right. So with with him, I keep asking why. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9987.64s)]
*  Why do you want to send people to Mars? [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9990.359999999999s)]
*  Why should humankind be interplanetary so that the flame of consciousness never gets extinguished? [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=9992.439999999999s)]
*  Why? Why can't you go into the ocean? [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10000.359999999999s)]
*  Why can't you build bubble cities? Why can't you build floating clouds? [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10003.24s)]
*  Well, if the earth gets destroyed. OK. But why? [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10006.039999999999s)]
*  Why what? Why? Why? [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10009.32s)]
*  Why continue with humanity? Not just humans. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10011.0s)]
*  And he's talking about human consciousness, which could also mean like AI stuff or whatever. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10013.48s)]
*  But but here's my here's my bigger point. You've you had Ryan Holiday on recently. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10017.96s)]
*  He's got these momentum or coins, right? [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10021.96s)]
*  Momentum or he means remember you're going to die. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10024.199999999999s)]
*  Allegedly, Roman emperors would have some courtesan walking next to them, [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10026.039999999999s)]
*  so they wouldn't have too much hubris. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10030.359999999999s)]
*  They would say, remember, you're immortal. You're going to die. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10032.039999999999s)]
*  That was done to motivate them to suck the marrow out of life while you're alive. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10035.48s)]
*  Right. So my question at some level is, well, is that true only of individuals? [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10040.199999999999s)]
*  Or like, could it be true of a civilization as a whole? [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10046.199999999999s)]
*  Could it be true that like, hey, wait, we shouldn't be dedicating all this effort. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10049.08s)]
*  And I think it's I wouldn't say it's as unlikely as life, you know, [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10053.24s)]
*  having iPhones on Proxima Centauri B. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10057.32s)]
*  But but I'd say it's pretty unlikely that we're going to do that in the next 100 years, [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10059.64s)]
*  have colonized Mars. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10063.4s)]
*  It's it's incredibly difficult from a technological standpoint, [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10064.84s)]
*  from a biological standpoint, a psychological standpoint, the raw material. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10067.88s)]
*  There's a tremendous number of reasons that it's sure. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10072.68s)]
*  But if technology progresses the way it has since 1800, the way I mean, it's the world's [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10074.52s)]
*  unrecognizable. You could conceivably say that if it continues in the same direction and we don't [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10081.0s)]
*  blow ourselves up, we may very well have the ability to do something like that. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10086.04s)]
*  So there's and if you say why, well, why not? [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10090.6s)]
*  Well, why not is always a good answer. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10093.960000000001s)]
*  Fascinating, because it's interesting, because people want to do it, because it would be [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10095.32s)]
*  significant to have human life living on a terraformed Mars. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10099.480000000001s)]
*  Put it on our resume. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10103.88s)]
*  Maybe we could use Mars as like a test to like how to recharge an atmosphere if we fuck it up. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10104.759999999998s)]
*  Right. But isn't it better just not to fuck it up? [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10109.24s)]
*  Yeah, it is not. It is better not to fuck it up. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10111.16s)]
*  But it's also interesting. Like why go to the moon? Why send satellites up there? [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10113.08s)]
*  Why look at stars? Why all those things? [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10117.72s)]
*  It's part of this human desire to constantly innovate and move forward. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10120.039999999999s)]
*  But I question the Moore's law kind of compatibility. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10125.08s)]
*  And actually, you talked about this with Michio Kaku. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10128.279999999999s)]
*  And he was in his new book about quantum supremacy, which is this kind of faith in these [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10130.92s)]
*  exponential curves. And exponential curves are really tricking mofos because they sneak [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10137.4s)]
*  up on you for a long time like this. And they go like this. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10142.28s)]
*  Right. Well, one of the things that they do after they do this is they do this. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10144.36s)]
*  They come down. Right. You've heard of peak oil and stuff like that. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10148.04s)]
*  Right. There's only a finite amount of oil because [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10150.76s)]
*  there's only a finite amount of pre-carbon as fossil fuels, etc. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10153.56s)]
*  But it's worse than that. As we get more and more [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10158.199999999999s)]
*  technologically capable, we get better and better at keeping the Ponzi scheme going in a sense. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10162.84s)]
*  The ore grade of gold used to be like in California, 1849. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10168.519999999999s)]
*  They would stumble upon a huge brick rock of gold. That never happens anymore. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10173.48s)]
*  The amount of gold per ton is like a gram per ton. It's incredibly small. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10177.16s)]
*  And it's going down. All these things are going down. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10181.4s)]
*  All these diminishing S-curves, they call them. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10183.64s)]
*  They start off really high. And so you get the go-go 90. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10185.72s)]
*  And then it goes drops off to zero. There's no saying that that might not also [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10188.279999999999s)]
*  happen for both extraction of resources that you need to build a colony on Mars, fuel, [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10192.76s)]
*  rocket parts, etc. But also for the coming AI and computing revolution. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10198.039999999999s)]
*  In other words, Moore's law is saturating for a very interesting reason. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10203.64s)]
*  It's not that the speed of the computers is still doubling. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10207.32s)]
*  But the amount of... Do you care about the speed of your computer? [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10211.56s)]
*  You care about what I can do with it, right? How fast does the web page load up? [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10214.36s)]
*  Right? Well, so you can have the fastest computer, but it's loading really slowly [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10217.400000000001s)]
*  because there's so many other people that want to take advantage and use that same resource. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10220.76s)]
*  It's a very highly in demand resource. That will happen with quantum computing too. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10224.2s)]
*  It's already happening with classical supercomputers. In other words, their speed [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10228.2s)]
*  is going up. But the number of floating point operations they do is saturating because so many [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10231.320000000002s)]
*  people want to use them because they're so good. They're a victim of their own success in a certain [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10235.720000000001s)]
*  sense. Same thing can happen with mineral. So the question is, do we get there? [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10239.16s)]
*  If not, well, what would that mean? Would we have a civilization existential crisis? I don't know. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10243.24s)]
*  I really don't know. But even all the things you just stated, [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10249.4s)]
*  isn't that just within our technological limitations as of today and our understanding [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10252.04s)]
*  of how to put together computers, our understanding of what technology can consist of in terms of [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10256.44s)]
*  minerals, in terms of stable materials? Yes and no. But like I said, there's only [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10261.8s)]
*  so much carbon in the earth. There's only so many prebiologic fossils. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10268.12s)]
*  Can it be recycled? Can we find new ways to use it? Can't we figure out a way to? [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10271.32s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, we can. But the question is, these different things have to overlap. And actually, [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10276.68s)]
*  because I was interested to go back just to the UAP thing for one minute, which was, [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10281.64s)]
*  think about the human factors involved in something like what Grush is describing. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10287.64s)]
*  Imagine that you have this ability to go back and start like something happened in 1947 in Roswell. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10293.4s)]
*  Let's just say something definitely happened. So there were some people there that witnessed [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10300.36s)]
*  something. They might've been military. They might've been research scientists. People had [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10305.16s)]
*  to go there, identify it, notify people. Then people had to go there and pick it up, clean it up, [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10309.400000000001s)]
*  bring it in a flatbed truck, transport it, store it, keep it processed. Then there's biologics. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10315.16s)]
*  He's saying there's biologics. So the biologics had to be processed by a biologist, not by the [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10320.6s)]
*  same corpsman who collected it. And guess what? All these guys have wives or husbands or [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10324.68s)]
*  bosses or friends and stuff. So my friend James Altucher is a very big influence in my podcast [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10330.6s)]
*  and career as well. He talks about a conspiracy number. What's the maximum number of people [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10336.04s)]
*  that can possibly be part of a conspiracy before it gets out, before it's exposed? [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10341.880000000001s)]
*  And there's also overlap between that and their time scales. Talking about a sustained conspiracy, [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10346.92s)]
*  let's give him the benefit of the doubt that this is true. But this is now coming out now. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10353.0s)]
*  You tweeted about this, or you mentioned this a couple of weeks ago on a podcast, I forget with [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10359.64s)]
*  whom, but you said the atomic age coincided with the age of Roswell. You mentioned that, [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10363.4s)]
*  and that's true. There was another thing that happened during that age, the quantum age. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10370.36s)]
*  So quantum mechanics, which is discovery of forces, fields, maybe fifth forces and unseen [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10373.8s)]
*  things, spooky action at a distance, aliens, and then the notion of atomic holocaust, et cetera. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10379.16s)]
*  All these things are in the zeitgeist at that moment, and you're right, they nucleate at that [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10386.84s)]
*  same time. What if right now is also that time? Because now we're also talking about it, like UAPs, [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10390.6s)]
*  fifth forces, all these other things. And now instead of the Cold War, we have a hot war. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10397.800000000001s)]
*  All these things are united and we have global climate change. I always say there's a concept [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10403.880000000001s)]
*  called the von Karman line, which is the boundary between the earth and the space. It's about 60 [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10407.960000000001s)]
*  miles, 100 kilometers above the earth's surface. And basically almost everything that we're dealing [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10412.6s)]
*  with existentially happens below that line, right? Pandemics, COVID, respiratory, atmospheric [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10417.720000000001s)]
*  transmission, a nuclear war and the effects of such a thing on the earth and things in the UAP [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10423.160000000002s)]
*  space that are happening and the boundary between earth and space. These are all kind of happening. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10429.880000000001s)]
*  And I'm wondering if it's not sort of related at some level to this kind of being in the cultural [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10435.400000000001s)]
*  consciousness. And that's why it's all coming to date, because to think about a conspiracy of seven [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10440.84s)]
*  decades maintained with probably a minimum of a thousand people kept secret, there's a probability [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10445.960000000001s)]
*  of that happening, but we should be precise about it and we should do calculate that and not dismiss [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10452.84s)]
*  it, but also be precise about it. Well, it also depends upon what kind of people you're talking [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10457.4s)]
*  about. If you're talking about only high level military people that have a long history of being [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10462.12s)]
*  able to keep secrets, that it's a part of the culture and these are the only people that have [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10467.24s)]
*  access to these vehicles or this thing, I could conceivably see how someone could keep something [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10472.199999999999s)]
*  quiet for a very long time. And then you have people that have claimed to have seen these things [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10478.119999999999s)]
*  and worked on these things. And it's always hard when you're dealing with anecdotal evidence and [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10482.6s)]
*  people discussing things and you don't know what's true and what's not true. What is fascinating to me [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10487.64s)]
*  is when, have you seen the GoFast video? Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about those videos where [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10495.32s)]
*  there's no heat signature, no visible means of propulsion and these things are whipping through [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10500.52s)]
*  the sky? I mean, you've talked to Mick West and other people and I'm not saying he's a scientist [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10506.04s)]
*  in the sense that someone like I am, but some of these things are, it always comes down to like, [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10510.92s)]
*  well, whose data is it? Right. So these are fighter jet pilots that are seeing these things [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10515.880000000001s)]
*  and they're discussing it. Play that video so you could listen to their discussion of it while [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10522.359999999999s)]
*  they're seeing this thing. What do you think it is? So when I look at those things, there's a couple [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10527.96s)]
*  of different things that you have to look at from an optical perspective, from a sensor perspective, [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10534.359999999999s)]
*  from a... Let me hear them talk. Yeah. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10538.519999999999s)]
*  So right now we're looking at this video where this thing seems to be trying to tracking it, [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10546.92s)]
*  their systems are trying to track it. So they locked onto it now. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10551.32s)]
*  So obviously they're freaking out. Yeah. So they locked onto it with their weapon system. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10575.96s)]
*  So there's something called scale invariance, which is where you can't really tell in certain [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10581.32s)]
*  phenomena, fractals are like, have you ever seen like the Mandelbrot set? So no matter how much you [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10585.48s)]
*  zoom into it or zoom out of it, it looks the same. And there are lots of features like that. And one [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10589.640000000001s)]
*  of the manifestations of it is the ocean surface. There are waves on top of waves, you've seen the [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10593.800000000001s)]
*  beautiful Japanese wood cutaway, it's like wave on top. It's incredible. So there you're seeing [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10597.720000000001s)]
*  a lot of waves, but it's impossible to have any depth perception, right? Because we're only getting [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10602.12s)]
*  a single view of it. And there's a gyroscopic stabilization tool that they're using in the [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10605.8s)]
*  FLIR system that's measuring it, right? So there is a heat signature, that's how I can see it on [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10610.759999999998s)]
*  FLIR, the forward looking infrared. I mean, propulsion. It's universal. It's not like there's [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10614.519999999999s)]
*  something coming out the back, like a jet engine where you could see it clearly. So there have been [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10619.56s)]
*  mock-ups and simulations done for this where it's like, you could have a balloon, you could have [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10623.72s)]
*  something spherical or something that's actually going with the wind. Can't they detect how fast [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10627.48s)]
*  it's moving? No, so not from that video, you can't necessarily. But from their systems, [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10631.96s)]
*  from their weapon systems, they can't detect how fast. Like clearly they were having a hard [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10637.16s)]
*  time locking onto it. So I asked Ariel Kleinerman and Ryan about this and they said it's classic. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10641.08s)]
*  They wouldn't tell me what their radar is capable of saying, only that they can use it to [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10646.279999999999s)]
*  determine certain properties of things. But it seemed very evident in that video that they were [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10650.439999999999s)]
*  having a hard time catching it because it was moving at a very high rate of speed. This is [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10654.039999999999s)]
*  2004, I think this video. Was that one? Yeah. So they're trying to lock onto this thing and [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10658.28s)]
*  it's moving too fast. And you see the crosshairs try to keep up with it. And then finally it locks [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10663.960000000001s)]
*  onto it and that's when they cheer that we got it. And they say, look at that thing go. Don't you [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10668.6s)]
*  think they would have an understanding of the speed that something's moving and not think of [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10673.400000000001s)]
*  it as a balloon that's just floating around? Well, remember this is stabilized. So they're [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10678.76s)]
*  locking on. So they're moving in a perspective where it's- Right. But don't you think their [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10682.84s)]
*  equipment has the ability to detect speed? Do you know how big the field of view of that thing was? [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10687.4s)]
*  I don't. Yeah. So we don't either. I don't know if they released how large they estimate it is. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10691.64s)]
*  So this is all leaked video, right? Right. So if you were to look through this telescope at the [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10698.199999999999s)]
*  moon and there was a balloon floating in front of the moon and you could see it and it was big and [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10703.96s)]
*  not like a Chinese spy balloon or something like that. And it's moving and you're moving [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10709.4s)]
*  and you don't know the relative field of view compared to the size of this object. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10713.72s)]
*  It may appear that it's going, if that thing is as the size of an Ember Air jetliner, [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10718.039999999999s)]
*  yeah, that's fricking fast, right? If it's the size of a balloon being carried by the wind that you [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10722.519999999999s)]
*  are stabilized as in a parcel of wind, it might not be- We're assuming that there's wind. We're [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10726.599999999999s)]
*  assuming it's being carried by the wind. But we're assuming it's being carried by the wind in the same [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10731.48s)]
*  direction. We don't know which way the wind was blowing. We don't, but what my point is that they [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10735.56s)]
*  seem to think that that was very unusual. And these aren't guys that are just like, [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10740.44s)]
*  oh my God, a balloon, shoot it. Well, that's when I went back to the feeling of pity that, [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10745.16s)]
*  and again, he doesn't even have pity, but let's say your life, you were seeing these things [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10749.4s)]
*  and let's just say, let's forget it. It's a Chinese war drone, military drone that's coming [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10754.36s)]
*  to blow up the Nimitz or whatever they were on. And so you then, your compatriot, your comrade [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10760.12s)]
*  comes back to the deck and you put Independence Day posters on his rug and you've seen it too. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10767.64s)]
*  That's not what I would do. If my kid comes to me and says, I saw the boogeyman or something, [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10775.16s)]
*  she's really nervous. I don't say, well, let me tease her about it. No, not her. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10780.039999999999s)]
*  Okay. I wouldn't do that to my kid, but I would definitely do that to my friends. If one of my [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10785.72s)]
*  friends said they saw an alien, 100%. Oh, Joe, you would do it. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10789.56s)]
*  I would take a rubber alien, I'd put it in their bed, have it tucked in. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10792.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but just for fun. And that's what those guys were doing to him. You're making it seem like they [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10796.359999999999s)]
*  horribly insulted him. They were just busting balls. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10801.96s)]
*  Let me say this. Your pilot, let's say you charter a private jet sometime, [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10804.199999999999s)]
*  you're out with Lex and you're going to Vegas and you charter a private jet, right? [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10808.279999999999s)]
*  You're on the jet. The guy who's in there is flying the plane and you found out that he actually was [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10813.08s)]
*  an ex-military pilot and he did see one of these things. And so you get one of your friends, [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10818.519999999999s)]
*  your buddies dresses up as an alien, bust into the cockpit and starts, I'm the alien. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10823.48s)]
*  You wouldn't do it. I mean, that's like a silly comparison. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10828.92s)]
*  What we're talking about is a guy who comes back from a flight claiming to have seen UFOs [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10831.64s)]
*  and his friends bust his balls. This happened many times. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10837.56s)]
*  But that's in the military. That's normal military shit. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10839.64s)]
*  But Ryan's saying the opposite now. Ryan's saying these people are scared for their safety now. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10842.359999999999s)]
*  Now he's doing the Americans for Safe Aerospace that he has to be, and part of their mission is [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10846.92s)]
*  to protect pilots and destigmatize them. This is because of close encounters with [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10850.6s)]
*  these things, right? And destigmatize. This is the square in a circle. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10853.32s)]
*  The cube around a sphere. Is it a cube around a sphere? [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10859.720000000001s)]
*  It could be. Which way is it? Is it a black cube that's in a sphere? [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10862.36s)]
*  It's on my video. I made a very expensive thumbnail for my video with Ryan Graves. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10865.48s)]
*  A sphere in a cube. A sphere inside a cube? [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10869.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So this sphere inside a cube is a repeating theme, right? They see a lot of these. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10872.36s)]
*  On the East Coast. On the East Coast. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10878.2s)]
*  Do you think these things are drones? What do you think these things are? [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10880.839999999998s)]
*  Well, do you remember the Chinese spy balloon that came about recently? [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10884.519999999999s)]
*  And do you remember how he didn't shoot it down? Do you remember when that came about? [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10889.16s)]
*  It was like right before this disclosure was about to get kicked off. I mean, [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10892.599999999999s)]
*  there's some weird things that are going on. There's certainly things- [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10896.599999999999s)]
*  You connect those two things together. One thing that moves in a very bizarre way that they can't [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10899.08s)]
*  seem to replicate. They don't know how these things stay stable at 120 knots. According to [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10904.039999999999s)]
*  equipment, unless their equipment totally sucks. This is like the equipment that got upgraded in [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10910.439999999999s)]
*  2014. Right. But then they say, I can't tell you about the equipment. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10914.199999999999s)]
*  But they can tell you that when the equipment was upgraded, that's when they started detecting [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10918.119999999999s)]
*  these things. So if the equipment is accurate and the equipment is upgraded and then they put it on [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10922.119999999999s)]
*  these jets and these guys are detecting these things, and then there's visual confirmation of [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10926.759999999998s)]
*  these things by multiple pilots. And it's a reoccurring thing. They see them in the same [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10931.56s)]
*  areas all the time. Well then why wouldn't the government go out? Why wouldn't they be [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10936.44s)]
*  sending out ... I asked Ryan that. I said, why don't they send out sorties every day? If they're [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10940.84s)]
*  doing it at nothing less, they could do it for training. Because maybe it's theirs. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10944.28s)]
*  Right. It could be. Maybe it's theirs. The US shoots down another flying object over Canada. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10947.560000000001s)]
*  This is six months ago. What'd they shoot down? They didn't say. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10952.12s)]
*  I'm sure that ... Well, I had Mike Baker on who used to be with the CIA and he was explaining [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10955.880000000001s)]
*  all these Chinese balloons. Oh, this is from ... Eric Weinstein shared this yesterday. He said [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10959.720000000001s)]
*  there's these three different ... On the screen is a map of three different NORAD [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10963.72s)]
*  shots that happened this time. And he just says, I don't remember these happening to you. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10967.48s)]
*  You know how much each one of those missiles cost, by the way? [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10972.199999999999s)]
*  No. It's over a million dollars. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10974.199999999999s)]
*  Didn't they miss once? Yep. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10975.8s)]
*  Ha ha. Because you're not shooting it ... [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10977.0s)]
*  Where'd that fucking missile go? These balloons that people don't realize it. [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10978.84s)]
*  When you're at altitude, it's not like this. So the pressure outside is almost equal to the [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10981.72s)]
*  pressure inside. So if you shoot it with bullets and pepper it with a bullet, it does nothing. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10985.64s)]
*  It's just like opening a door in a warehouse. You have to detach it from the payload. That's [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10990.28s)]
*  why they shot it with a missile. Oh, wow. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10994.28s)]
*  So those are million bucks a pop. But I wanted to just get back to the- [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10995.880000000001s)]
*  The possibility of what they are. The possibility of what they are. So [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=10999.800000000001s)]
*  I always have to look for the simplest explanation of what they could be. And certainly the simplest [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11003.480000000001s)]
*  explanation ... I don't think anyone would disagree. The simplest explanation is certainly [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11007.480000000001s)]
*  not ... These are interdimensional beings that have traveled across the literal equivalent [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11011.400000000001s)]
*  of trillions upon trillions of miles, or if you like, thousands of light years or [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11015.88s)]
*  millions of light years, as objects only to navigate that whole way and end up being [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11020.92s)]
*  sighted off of Catalina Island and Newport News or Virginia. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11026.279999999999s)]
*  Maybe they don't care if they get sighted. Maybe that's part of their fun. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11031.56s)]
*  So then there's a teleological explanation. We're trying to propose a mechanism by which [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11035.32s)]
*  that motivates some species or something to do that. Now Avi, to get back and give him his [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11039.48s)]
*  credit, because I don't want to be perceived as I'm denigrating him in any way, but he has built [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11044.76s)]
*  this Galileo project. And I should say, I never got interested in any of this stuff, Joe. Although [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11049.48s)]
*  I do think if it were true, you know who should be the most interested in it, our physics professors [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11055.960000000001s)]
*  and physics researchers, right? Because if it's true that they have mastered, there are creatures [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11061.32s)]
*  that have mastered the interdimensional manipulation of space time, that would shortcut me and my [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11065.64s)]
*  colleagues four or five centuries, right? And it would be just a revolution. Think of the Nobel [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11071.08s)]
*  prizes you could win, right? I think a tenure. If you were allowed to have access to it. Right. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11075.48s)]
*  If they do have some sort of a back engineering program, who could conceivably be qualified to do [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11080.2s)]
*  that? This is where I disagree with Eric. I always say Eric, you know, Eric is my atomic clock. You [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11088.2s)]
*  know, they say like a broken clock's right twice a day. Like Eric's almost always right. He's in my [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11094.76s)]
*  atomic clock. So I get a great dear from Eric. But, you know, but when he says that, you know, [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11099.24s)]
*  these objects, you know, that we need, where are the theoretical physicists studying this? [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11106.039999999999s)]
*  I claim you don't really need theoretical physicists to study it. Yeah, you might instead want [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11110.28s)]
*  experimental physicists such as myself, my colleagues, that people that are used to dealing [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11115.8s)]
*  with data, with sensors, with actually building technology, observing things, again, observing [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11119.4s)]
*  the skies. We've been watching the skies in all wavelengths. By the way, you only see it with like [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11125.24s)]
*  visible light. How come these aren't showing up only in the radar microwave region of the spectrum, [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11129.08s)]
*  infrared? Why would they choose the narrow band of wavelengths that some marginal species of, [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11134.2s)]
*  you know, primitive apes, you know, evolved apes have sensitivity to, namely this narrow window? [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11139.16s)]
*  This is infinitesimal. You're saying why wouldn't they hide themselves? Why wouldn't there be other [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11144.2s)]
*  modalities in which they're observed other than visible sightings, eyewitness sightings, which, [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11148.76s)]
*  in other words, why couldn't they manipulate the signatures that they travel in? Maybe they'd be [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11154.039999999999s)]
*  neutrinos. Maybe they could be using gravitational waves. Who knows? But that you don't need Edward [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11158.68s)]
*  Witten to help you with, right? You don't need a theoretical physicist. You need an experimental [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11164.28s)]
*  physicist, an observational astronomer who's used to looking through telescope. My whole job, Joe, [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11169.08s)]
*  staring up at the sky with things like this in all different dimensions and booking for objects that [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11175.08s)]
*  don't seem to make sense or looking for phenomena that have never been observed before. But why would [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11180.52s)]
*  you assume that they would want to hide? I'm not saying they would want to hide. I'm just saying [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11184.36s)]
*  they seem to be evasive, right? So in other words, they're maybe just the way they travel is so [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11188.2s)]
*  insane that you can't really detect. They only go on Catalina Island and Newport News. In other [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11193.16s)]
*  words, how come they're not over the observatory that's in western Texas that the University of [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11198.04s)]
*  Texas is? How come they get spotted over military bases? Well, that's what I'm saying. So does that [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11203.16s)]
*  lead to, so the fact, if I just told you nothing, but they happen to appear in restricted warning [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11206.76s)]
*  areas, military areas, would you say that they're, would you say that makes them more likely to be [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11211.400000000001s)]
*  aliens? I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say more likely. I would say if I was an alien and I came [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11215.96s)]
*  here to observe a territorial ape with nuclear weapons, I would probably check out where the [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11221.08s)]
*  nuclear weapons are. I'd be like, what are these fucking crazy assholes up to? They're blowing [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11227.24s)]
*  themselves up by dropping bombs out of planes and they have enough missiles pointing at each other [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11233.16s)]
*  all over the world to essentially eliminate all life. Well, that's the opposite. I think I would [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11238.039999999999s)]
*  look. I think that's where I would look. I think I would look over those military bases and I think [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11242.12s)]
*  I'd maybe let myself be known. Shot them all down. We're the best. We're number one. We are. The aliens [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11246.6s)]
*  know it. I mean, there have been multiple sightings. I'm sure you know about this. Yeah, but there's [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11253.400000000001s)]
*  been many. If you look at the map of sightings, it's far more America. It's a very American themed [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11257.400000000001s)]
*  idea, particularly because of Roswell. Correct. And you know that when Venus, the planet Venus, [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11263.800000000001s)]
*  is not visible, that UFO sightings go down by over 40 percent. Oh, I'm sure. Well, I mean, [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11269.72s)]
*  you can explain away the vast majority of them and then you could also have, there's people that [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11275.16s)]
*  hallucinate. There's people that have, they have mental health breakdowns where they actually, [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11280.199999999999s)]
*  actually believe that things happen that didn't really happen. And some of those things could be [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11286.599999999999s)]
*  a UFO abduction. There's not, we know that people have wild, vivid dreams and then we know that the [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11291.64s)]
*  border to dreams and consciousness is why are all these UFO abduction stories at night? [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11298.039999999999s)]
*  Were you dreaming, Bob? Mostly men. Yeah. Bob, were you dreaming? Did they really touch your [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11305.64s)]
*  butt and take your sperm? You know what I mean? It's like- We've reached the limits of rectal [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11309.96s)]
*  probing. It's not like they happen while you're at work. It's not like they abduct you when you go [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11314.52s)]
*  to the restroom and all of a sudden something hovers outside the window and pulls you through. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11318.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like always in the middle of the night. But let me ask you this. [[03:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11324.599999999999s)]
*  So when I brought this up, when I first got interested in this, it was really, I should say, [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11328.599999999999s)]
*  I have this disposition as you've already uncovered that I don't believe that there's [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11335.88s)]
*  extraterrestrial technology in the whole universe with high confidence or even with moderate degree [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11339.96s)]
*  of confidence. So therefore I certainly don't believe that there are, I'm not predisposed to [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11347.4s)]
*  believe that there are alien technology crafts visiting the earth, right? But when I talk about [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11352.6s)]
*  that and I say, look, there are these astronomers and there are these people like me who study [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11357.4s)]
*  things and NASA. And part of the reason I got interested to take this seriously is my friend, [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11361.640000000001s)]
*  David Spurgill, is one of my mentors. And he is leading NASA's UAP investigation for NASA, [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11366.12s)]
*  which didn't report last month. And so on Twitter, this whole thing is like, well, how come you're [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11373.24s)]
*  not at the reporting thing and we don't have any reason to trust NASA? There's a whole subculture [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11377.640000000001s)]
*  which I think is like almost like denialism, whatever form you want to employ for that, [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11382.44s)]
*  but that won't accept any explanation unless it's aliens. And there's a huge subculture, right? [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11387.560000000001s)]
*  So how should I as a scientist interact with a lay person who's educated, well-meaning perhaps, [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11392.68s)]
*  but has this deep distrust of science, scientists, the scientific method? I mean, how do I? [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11398.04s)]
*  I don't think they necessarily have a deep trust of science or the scientific method or even that. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11403.480000000001s)]
*  But I think there's a large number of people that have a vested interest in believing that [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11407.800000000001s)]
*  aliens are amongst us and that UFOs are real and that disclosure is about to happen, partially [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11412.36s)]
*  because it's fun. It's very fun. The idea of thinking that there's aliens out there is so [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11417.640000000001s)]
*  exciting. I love it. I mean, obviously, really, I have fucking aliens everywhere. But I'm also [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11423.08s)]
*  skeptical of things that just seem fake. There's something about this whole thing that seems like [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11430.2s)]
*  a show. And it really kind of brings me back to, I mean, I'm not accusing people of mind control [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11436.28s)]
*  experiments, but it has been done in this country many, many times. And one of the big ones was MK [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11442.36s)]
*  Ultra and Operation Midnight Climax where they set up, the CIA literally set up brothels and gave [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11449.24s)]
*  these Johns LSD and monitored them through two-way mirrors. We know that there's been [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11456.2s)]
*  PsyOps before. And when there's all this discussion about out of world crafts and not of this world and [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11463.4s)]
*  we have alien bodies, I'm like, yeah, fucking stop talking. Show me some shit. At a certain [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11470.84s)]
*  point in time, you're going to have to stop talking and show me some shit. Because right now, I'm like, [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11476.92s)]
*  I don't like the way this sounds. It sounds funky. And this is someone who thinks that aliens are real. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11480.6s)]
*  No, I know you do. Yeah. I just think there's something about this. I believe Commander David [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11487.56s)]
*  Fravor. I believe him. I believe that he knows what he saw. I believe he saw something extraordinary. [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11492.12s)]
*  I'm just not, I don't know where it came from. Right. But the idea that we had something like [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11498.28s)]
*  that in 2004 is even weirder. Yeah, you're right. That's even weirder because it's like, [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11502.68s)]
*  now we're talking about, there's a giant difference between 19 years ago, the physics of 19 years ago, [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11507.240000000002s)]
*  the, our understanding of propulsion systems, technology, computing, everything. iPhone, [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11513.800000000001s)]
*  plethora. We didn't have the iPhone. We didn't have anything back then. We had shitty little [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11518.36s)]
*  fucking flip phones. It's just such a different world. Well, let me, let me run this by you. So [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11521.64s)]
*  what the United States government did to Native Americans, tremendous atrocities, right? There were, [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11527.4s)]
*  but there was almost as much done. I don't want to say almost. There was a lot of inter-tribal [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11532.439999999999s)]
*  warfare where we would cause them to fight with each other. Yeah. And that was part of our strategy [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11537.72s)]
*  to atomize them and to reduce their capability to mount some kind of a force against the United [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11542.68s)]
*  States government, which is truly awful part of our history. But nevertheless, they, you know, [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11548.76s)]
*  so that there was also a plausible deniability. Well, you Indians were fighting against each other [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11554.68s)]
*  too. It wasn't like you guys had to, you know, so I'm wondering at this level, is there a possibility? [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11558.52s)]
*  I don't, I'm not going to set up alien wars and fake alien wars to blame or just anything that [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11563.48s)]
*  polarizes us, right? Cause that's good for them. It allows them to sell, you know, the Viagra, [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11568.44s)]
*  right? I mean, something that attracts attention, that's almost impossible to, to disregard. I mean, [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11572.84s)]
*  anybody who's curious and knows what an alien is or seen an alien we've seen so much. [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11578.039999999999s)]
*  But I don't know. I mean, I don't know either. I just, I feel like if they kept it a secret for [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11582.919999999998s)]
*  80 years, that's very fascinating. And if it is real also very fascinating, but there's just [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11588.839999999998s)]
*  something about the way this is all being discussed that just feels fake. And I don't know why. And [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11594.839999999998s)]
*  maybe it's real. Maybe again, maybe it is just my natural reaction to something that is so [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11602.52s)]
*  outside of the norm that I don't have a context for it. I don't have a place for it. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11609.16s)]
*  Might also be, there's a religious component to it. There's a religious component to it. Space daddy. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11613.08s)]
*  It's like, yeah, the simulation hypothesis, right? This is another one that people just like look to [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11617.24s)]
*  and they act as an explanation why we don't have free will because they don't want to be held to [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11621.48s)]
*  their accountability. I always say to these people like Sam Harris, like who doesn't believe in free [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11625.960000000001s)]
*  will? I'm like, have you ever met someone? I don't know. Let's give you. Have you ever met someone [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11629.88s)]
*  who acts as if they don't have free will? I'm not talking about someone who's insane. Like something [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11633.24s)]
*  like, imagine Sam Harris, like totally rational, reasonable, brilliant, you know, intellectual [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11636.92s)]
*  person, but like him, but he's like, I don't believe in free will. Therefore I'm going to act [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11641.0s)]
*  in accordance with that belief. I've never met somebody like that. Like, right. Like I'm determined [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11645.32s)]
*  to do this because of the big bang. Well, I think it's a comp complex or complicated scenario [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11649.8s)]
*  where you're trying to say that determinism is the only thing that causes people to do things and [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11656.28s)]
*  that you're not responsible or not. You're not necessarily saying you're not responsible, [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11660.92s)]
*  but that there's you have no choice. There's these factors all play a part of it. That's what it [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11664.68s)]
*  seems like. It seems like we encourage choice in the right direction. We discourage choice that [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11669.720000000001s)]
*  we feel like is in the wrong direction. It seems like it's a, there's a part of us, uh, socially [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11676.28s)]
*  collectively as a group that wants the right choices to be made because we know that people [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11682.68s)]
*  have the ability to make decisions. Can I ask you a podcast question? Sure. So you've done [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11688.12s)]
*  2000, 40, 30 something. Yeah. More than that. When you count fight companions and MMA shows. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11693.64s)]
*  So, um, have you ever gone back and listened to like, no. Okay. So this kind of dovetails with, [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11701.48s)]
*  with what something Carl Sagan said, he said a book is magic because it allows the voice of a [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11707.48s)]
*  person who may have died many, many centuries earlier to communicate with you and literally [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11714.6s)]
*  with audio books, like literally in your ear as you are with millions of people around the world. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11720.039999999999s)]
*  And I've just wondered, you know, like, um, cause I never go back and listen to my podcast. I've [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11724.6s)]
*  listened to it. I shouldn't lie. I listened to a couple because of like, it was a Graham Hancock [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11728.359999999999s)]
*  one and I wanted to reabsorb some of the stuff that he said or, or, um, you know, [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11733.0s)]
*  someone was just really interested. Yeah, sure. But, but when I'm getting at is, you know, [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11737.48s)]
*  running a book and like encapsulating that, I mean, surely you've thought about it. And I'm [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11742.92s)]
*  just wondering, you know, a book is, is something different, you know, it's, it's really the operating [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11747.88s)]
*  system of humankind. Whereas audio is incredible, but like, what are the odds your great grandkids [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11753.24s)]
*  are going to listen to, you know, a preponderance of it versus the distilled wisdom of Joe Rogan, [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11758.2s)]
*  you know, put into a book form for posterity. I definitely thought about doing that. I'm just [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11763.960000000001s)]
*  very busy. You know, it's hard to take the time to write a fucking book. I'm not, I'm not going to [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11768.84s)]
*  get any help. No, no, I don't mean a ghostwriter. I just mean people to like research and like, [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11774.6s)]
*  well, this thing thematically, it would all be you, but it would be, yeah, I don't know. Maybe I've [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11778.76s)]
*  banded it about just, I'm trying not to overload, you know, I think people get a little too [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11783.8s)]
*  ambitious and I've been guilty of it myself. How so? Like just doing too many things. Like [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11789.64s)]
*  I do enough things like slow down, concentrate on the things I do more, you know, what gives you [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11794.759999999998s)]
*  the most life or most like energy force as far as occupations? No, no, there's all these things that [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11801.24s)]
*  keep you busy, but what's your, what thing causes time to pass the such that you're in a flow state [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11807.88s)]
*  the most? Oh, I don't know if there's any one thing that does, you know, I think it's just [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11812.28s)]
*  all the different things. I, I, I'm very fortunate that I have a lot of different things that I like [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11821.960000000001s)]
*  to do, you know, in terms of occupation and I have a lot of great people in my life in terms of family [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11826.92s)]
*  and friends. So I'm just very fortunate in that way, but they're all interesting in their own [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11834.6s)]
*  different way. I think they all compliment each other. That's one of the things that I like about [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11840.6s)]
*  doing podcasts and doing standup and even doing UFC commentary. I think they somehow or another, [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11844.68s)]
*  they compliment each other. That's something. Do you ever, when you do stand up, I did, [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11849.880000000001s)]
*  I was able to do a Ted X talk a long time ago and before I did it, I wanted to get the experience [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11854.28s)]
*  of bombing on stage in front of an audience of possible hostile people. So I went to the comedy [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11859.56s)]
*  store in La Jolla and I did a set and I only wanted to do it clean because my wife and my rabbi was [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11863.800000000001s)]
*  there. So I tried to clean, I had some good jokes, I think that I could work on the audience, [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11869.0s)]
*  but it was after like, you know, seven women talking about how they menstruate this and I was [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11876.36s)]
*  the only one who did it. Was it an open mic night? It was open mic. Yeah. It was just two minutes set. [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11881.32s)]
*  I was the last person to go. When I use my A material. But anyway, we came out and afterwards [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11885.48s)]
*  I was like, you know what, you know, it was enjoyable. I'm glad I did it. I could say I did [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11891.88s)]
*  two minutes of stand up, but actually I didn't like the people in the audience. You know, they [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11895.8s)]
*  were, I mean, they were drunk and like, whatever. I mean, I think my wife was there, but my cousin. [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11901.48s)]
*  Let's open mic night. First of all, a lot of maniacs are in the audience. Like who's going [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11907.24s)]
*  to watch some amateurs to stand up? If you have a certain amount of time with your day, how many [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11910.84s)]
*  people are going to go watch amateurs to stand up? I guess I just felt like this, like I never felt [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11915.96s)]
*  like I didn't like my students. Like I never felt, and I'm sure you don't feel like you don't like [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11920.279999999999s)]
*  your audience of podcasts, but do you ever, when you're doing stand up, it just seems like [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11924.92s)]
*  there's people in there. First of all, there are people in there that want to see you like mess up [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11928.84s)]
*  or heckle or not you, but I'm saying one, a comedy club for sure. And especially at an open mic night. [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11932.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's the dregs of humanity. Yeah, exactly. And on top of that, a lot of people that [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11937.72s)]
*  are there are there because they want to do comedy. So you're doing stand up to other want to be [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11941.48s)]
*  comedians. Some of them are they're out of their fucking minds. Well, not some of them, like a good [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11946.28s)]
*  chunk. Right. Yeah. And I guess the last couple of podcast questions, if you'd indulge me on them. [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11950.6s)]
*  So, you know, when I, when I think about, you know, the, the kind of animating impulse for, [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11956.76s)]
*  for me to do what I'm doing and trying to do, you know, hardcore science and keep people interested [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11963.56s)]
*  engaged and give the public some ROI and their money that supports my salary. I'm a public, [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11968.44s)]
*  you know, I went to public colleges, you know, schools, I went to public, I teach at a public [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11973.24s)]
*  school. You know, when I think about it, like there's, it's, it's difficult to get a sense of, [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11977.88s)]
*  of, you know, pleasing your audience and then also, you know, doing legit science. And I think, [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11984.759999999998s)]
*  you know, finding that balance for me, that's, that is hard for me. And I don't know, like, [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11990.839999999998s)]
*  I mean, obviously, one solution to stop podcast. I mean, I'm not going to stop being a scientist [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11995.48s)]
*  because who I am is physically written into my DNA. Why are they, why would they be incompatible? [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=11998.519999999999s)]
*  I guess, you know, it's like, I could always be doing real science. You know, I could always be, [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12004.119999999999s)]
*  for every hour I'm reading a book of a guest that's coming up, I could be doing an hour with, [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12008.119999999999s)]
*  you know, in the laboratory. And so- Right, but don't you, we've already talked about that [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12012.199999999999s)]
*  what you're doing is very beneficial. And you think that that's actually part of what scientists [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12015.48s)]
*  should be doing. I think they look down on it. Right. Some of them look down on it. Yeah. Yeah, [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12019.4s)]
*  don't listen to them. Fuck those people. There's always going to be people that are, you know, [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12023.8s)]
*  purists and there's always going to be people that have negative comments. You should only [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12029.32s)]
*  read so many things that people have said about your work. And I think you get to a certain point [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12035.08s)]
*  in time when you're oversaturated and then you get overwhelmed. And I see that happen with a lot of [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12040.119999999999s)]
*  people. I see that happen with a lot of people that get into, that come from academia, and then [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12044.279999999999s)]
*  they get into podcasting and they get overwhelmed. And it's very disheartening. Yeah. But you're not, [[03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12048.76s)]
*  you're just dealing with insane numbers. So of course you're going to have a lot of negativity. [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12054.76s)]
*  There's no ways around that. It doesn't matter what you talk about. I've seen some of the most [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12060.44s)]
*  fucking insane takes on some of the nicest people ever. It's just, you can't do anything about that. [[03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12066.44s)]
*  There's certain people that are there and that's fine. That's part of the way the world works. I [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12072.2s)]
*  don't know why certain people like certain kinds of music or certain kinds of art forms. It's just [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12075.960000000001s)]
*  people like different things. And when you're talking about whether it's science or comedy, [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12081.72s)]
*  you're going to have people that don't like what you do. That's just how it goes. [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12087.48s)]
*  And if I could do my last question, because I'd love to have you on my podcast, but I don't know [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12091.48s)]
*  if that's ever going to happen. We're going to talk about aliens the entire time. I would love it. [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12096.119999999999s)]
*  That would be my bread and butter, man. I would kill. I'd be number 10 on Spotify. [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12100.359999999999s)]
*  So I always ask the following question, which is related to the name of the podcast I mentioned [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12106.52s)]
*  earlier. Arthur C. Clarke had all these quips and some of them are really funny. One of them is like, [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12110.28s)]
*  for every expert, there's an equal and opposite expert. That's true. And he would say things. [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12114.6s)]
*  Especially paid experts. And this famous quote of any sufficiently advanced technology is [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12119.480000000001s)]
*  indistinguishable from magic. And then the name of my podcast comes from a statement that the [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12124.28s)]
*  only way to determine the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible. And I [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12129.24s)]
*  always phrase that in terms of your 20 year old self-advice. So like you were going back to Joe [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12133.320000000002s)]
*  and you know, back then you're 20 years old, you know, you had 30 seconds with him. What are you [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12137.8s)]
*  going to tell him? I'm going to tell him shit. I wouldn't tell me shit. Why? I wouldn't tell me [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12143.48s)]
*  nothing. Because he figured it out on your own. There's nothing I could have told him. You need [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12149.4s)]
*  life and you need a bunch of people that you interact with and you learn and you keep absorbing [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12155.16s)]
*  information and you keep trying to do a better job at being a human being and you get better. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12162.279999999999s)]
*  But you're going to have to go through it. There's not a goddamn thing I can say to my 20 year old [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12166.28s)]
*  self like, wow, this is the magic thing. Like it doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. It's a grind. [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12170.44s)]
*  It's not like a Willy Wonka golden ticket. Life is a grind. It's a great grind. It's a lot of fun. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12176.44s)]
*  And if you have a lot of fun friends, you can really enjoy it. But progress comes incrementally [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12183.640000000001s)]
*  with a lot of fucking work and you're going to have a lot of heartache and there's going to [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12193.16s)]
*  be a lot of heartbreak and there's going to be a lot of disappointment. And then there's going to [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12196.92s)]
*  be a lot of great moments and the great moments don't dwell on them too much. You got to figure [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12200.84s)]
*  out how to not get intoxicated by great moments and just enjoy it as part of the process. And then [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12206.12s)]
*  just keep trying to do whatever you're doing, whatever it is you're trying to do, whether [[03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12211.8s)]
*  you're trying to do science or whether you're trying to do art, whatever you're trying to do. [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12215.48s)]
*  If I give any advice, it's just like, don't expect this. Don't expect to hit the lottery. [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12220.199999999999s)]
*  That shit is not coming. And don't expect the fucking golden age of retirement either. [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12226.52s)]
*  Don't think you're going to get to 65 and one day I'm going to quit and then it's going to be [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12230.44s)]
*  amazing. I'm going to sit in my porch. No, you're going to die. That's what happens to people when [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12234.36s)]
*  they do that. They have nothing to do. They get sad. They get sad and they get bummed out. Just [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12238.68s)]
*  enjoy it. Just enjoy this fucking thing. But you want to live forever? [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12243.64s)]
*  That would be the scariest thing would be doing it all over again. Not living alive forever. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12251.16s)]
*  Because if you just were like, if I had like, look, I love life. I have a great time. If someone said [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12256.359999999999s)]
*  you have to do this forever, I wouldn't be terrified to do it. Like why not? It's fun. [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12261.72s)]
*  So you're saying I keep doing fun things for it. Do I keep getting better at stuff? [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12266.519999999999s)]
*  Because if I can keep getting better at stuff, as long as I don't physically deteriorate too much, [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12269.88s)]
*  and I can keep better getting better at stuff, that would be fun. I wouldn't hate it. Just like [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12273.72s)]
*  I don't want to die now. Like why would I want to, why would I not want to live forever? Like [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12277.4s)]
*  it's a kind of weird sort of way of looking at it because both of them are equally terrifying. [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12281.4s)]
*  The idea of living forever is terrifying and the idea of dying tonight is terrifying. [[03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12285.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I always see these guys, you know, Brian Johnson, you know, these guys that are [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12289.4s)]
*  trying to extend their lives. I'm like, you can extend, you can live forever. And actually it's [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12292.359999999999s)]
*  possible anybody, anybody can live forever. But you can't be a greedy SOB. You can't be greedy [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12296.519999999999s)]
*  and want your body to come with you and your, and your money and your, you know, [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12302.76s)]
*  the denial of death is why they built these pyramids. Right. So is that real though? We [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12306.36s)]
*  don't really know why they built those pyramids. Well, yeah, I don't know. You know that each [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12310.36s)]
*  pyramid has a base. The base of each pyramid, Joe, is a multiple, an exact integer multiple of pi. [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12313.64s)]
*  Did you know that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know that. Do you know why? Why? Because what they would [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12320.36s)]
*  do is they would measure back then like a surveyor, they'd measure the distance with a [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12325.16s)]
*  wheel that would roll. And the wheel has a circumference equal to pi times its diameter. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12330.2s)]
*  So they would get some number of wheel rolls. And that's the way the circle, the circle was [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12335.400000000001s)]
*  their measuring tape basically. So they would just count off how many complete revolutions of [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12339.240000000002s)]
*  the circles. Is this theoretical? That's what they believe. Yeah. No, that's the best evidence. [[03:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12342.76s)]
*  There's a lot of like weirdness to the pyramid. Just the mass alone, [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12347.880000000001s)]
*  does the three million or 2,300,000 stones. It was the biggest thing. Hundreds of miles away. [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12351.320000000002s)]
*  I know. It's nuts. It was the biggest thing until the Eiffel Tower. Have you ever looked into that, [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12356.92s)]
*  any of that Younger Dryas Impact theory? Help me with that. This is the theory that coincides [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12359.88s)]
*  with the end of the Ice Age. And it's also backed up by core samples where they believe that Earth [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12366.359999999999s)]
*  was hit somewhere around 11,800 years ago. And that all over Earth was hit with a comet storm, [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12372.519999999999s)]
*  you know, that we went through, went through a barrage of large objects and it destroyed civilization. [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12380.519999999999s)]
*  And that there was an advanced civilization in Egypt and in many other places where there's [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12388.12s)]
*  actual physical evidence now. Mexico. Yeah. Well, physical evidence now, Turkey and Gobekli Tepe. [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12393.08s)]
*  Because back then they thought that 11,000 plus years ago it was just hunter-gatherers. But then [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12399.400000000001s)]
*  they found this Gobekli Tepe. Did you know about that? No, I never heard of that. It's fascinating [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12404.92s)]
*  because it's like very complex stone structures that are immense. And they have 3D carvings on [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12409.320000000002s)]
*  them, which is very unique. And they have lizards, but the lizards are 3D on the outside. [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12414.6s)]
*  It's not like they carved into the stone. They carved the stone around the lizards and these [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12419.4s)]
*  fucking immense structures. And then they've only uncovered 5% of them. With LIDAR they found so [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12424.44s)]
*  many more of them. That's what the 3D carved structures look like. So they carbon dated all [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12431.16s)]
*  this stuff to, because it was purposely covered somehow or another. And they don't know who or [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12435.08s)]
*  why. But it was purposely covered somewhere around 11,000 plus years ago. And they think [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12439.96s)]
*  it was a comet? I mean, that would seem to have astronomical evidence for it. No, the comet thing [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12444.759999999998s)]
*  is 11,800 years ago. That's when, and they think again somewhere around 10,000 years ago as well, [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12449.96s)]
*  but it coincides with the end of the ice age. And it also coincides with, there's a lot of evidence [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12457.48s)]
*  of iridium when they do the core samples in that area. The element. Yeah. And then also [[03:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12463.8s)]
*  nanodiamonds from impacts. Yeah. So it's very fascinating because it just speaks to like, [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12468.68s)]
*  maybe civilization, maybe this isn't just this emergence from Genghis Khan to us today. Maybe [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12475.4s)]
*  there was like a reset and maybe many thousand years ago, like these people that built these [[03:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12481.880000000001s)]
*  structures. Like, do some people say the lizards are like aliens? No, that's, there's no alien [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12486.52s)]
*  lore in this. This is just humans that have reached, yeah, just humans that had reached a very [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12492.2s)]
*  advanced state and then got hit. But it wasn't until like this Younger Dryas Impact Theory that [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12497.4s)]
*  they had all the physical evidence that goes with this. And when Randall Carlson discusses, [[03:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12502.92s)]
*  it's very crazy because he talks about just the immense amount of water that moved through [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12508.52s)]
*  North America in a very short amount of time. It just carved massive trails and canyons through [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12513.72s)]
*  the earth. And he thinks it happened because of an instantaneous meltdown from asteroid impact. [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12521.64s)]
*  Because we know that the US alone was half of it was covered in more than a mile high sheet of ice [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12527.64s)]
*  up until that point. And he thinks that's what caused it. So it coincides with physical evidence [[03:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12534.92s)]
*  for these core samples. And there's a bunch of like legitimate scientists that are working on [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12539.72s)]
*  this. It's really interesting. I always say astronomers are kind of like space archaeologists, [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12543.08s)]
*  you know, we travel, things travel through time and space and we have to analyze them. [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12548.04s)]
*  And it's really fascinating stuff. We don't have to deal with the multiverse and with archaeologists. [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12551.64s)]
*  Well listen, man, April 8th. April 8th. We're gonna go check out and you say it's gonna be [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12556.92s)]
*  more insane than that. It'll blow your mind. I'm sure it will. And I really appreciate you. And [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12561.72s)]
*  thank you very much for the meteor and the shitty magnet and the good magnet and the prism. This is [[03:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12565.960000000001s)]
*  dope. Thank you. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. And I appreciate your time. Thank [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12572.68s)]
*  you for having me. And then tell everybody how to get your podcast as well. Oh, well, so the best [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12576.44s)]
*  place is briankeating.com. That's my website and I have links to Spotify. There it's called. There [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12580.12s)]
*  it is. Look at you, handsome devil. Thank you, my brother. Then yeah, there's our friend Eric. We [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12585.0s)]
*  didn't talk too much about. Yeah, he says that he sends his best. I talked to him today. And I've [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12589.24s)]
*  done yeah, I've done it 14 Nobel Prize winners, 15 by Friday. Beautiful. Beautiful. And they're [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12593.88s)]
*  very good. Thank you very much for being here. Appreciate you. All right. Bye everybody. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12599.0s)]
*  Bye. [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR92dSkBhbg&t=12615.0s)]
