*  Try them on. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=22.0s)]
*  Try them on and see what they look like. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=23.0s)]
*  They look fucking tough. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=24.0s)]
*  Those are tough, dude. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=25.0s)]
*  They fucking look good, dude. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=28.0s)]
*  You gotta get a pair of glasses, dude. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=30.0s)]
*  Do you need glasses? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=32.0s)]
*  I do for reading. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=34.0s)]
*  Those are what I can't see with my phone without them. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=35.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=37.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can't fucking see my phone without these. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=38.0s)]
*  What power are those? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=40.0s)]
*  I believe it's one eye is different than the other. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=41.0s)]
*  It's just prescription. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=44.0s)]
*  One eye is different than the other? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah, like one can see better or something like that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=47.0s)]
*  Did you get injured or is it just natural? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=49.0s)]
*  No, I think they call reading glasses in England 45s. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=51.0s)]
*  Because around 45 is when your eyes start going? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=55.0s)]
*  That's what happened to me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=58.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=59.0s)]
*  That's probably exactly what had happened to me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=60.0s)]
*  I remember doing the podcast and I couldn't read off a laptop. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=61.0s)]
*  I was actually doing a podcast with Neil deGrasse Tyson and I wanted to ask him about something [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=65.0s)]
*  and I pulled up the laptop and I was like, I can't fucking read this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah, out of nowhere. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=73.0s)]
*  I had perfect sight, perfect hearing, everything. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, it just falls off like a cliff. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=76.0s)]
*  45, boom, couldn't read. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=78.0s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=79.0s)]
*  There's a way to stop it in its tracks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=80.0s)]
*  There's supplements that you could take. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=82.0s)]
*  There's a company called Pure Encapsulations and they have a thing called macular support. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=84.0s)]
*  And I started taking macular support and it stopped it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=89.0s)]
*  Stopped it in its tracks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=92.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, so now I can read my phone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=95.0s)]
*  It might have even actually got a little bit better. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=96.0s)]
*  So I don't have a problem reading my phone, like reading text messages and shit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=98.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=101.0s)]
*  But I prefer, if I'm reading an article, I read with glasses on. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=102.0s)]
*  Well, the thing is such too is that they don't make cool glasses for men. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=106.0s)]
*  Reading glasses. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=112.0s)]
*  Those are fucking cool. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=113.0s)]
*  Well, this is. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=114.0s)]
*  They have like a nice red tint to them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=115.0s)]
*  This is from this guy in the East Village, my friend Anthony. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=117.0s)]
*  They look like they're from the East Village. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=121.0s)]
*  They do, they look cool. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah, this guy makes them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=125.0s)]
*  Like this is like a Rolex. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=126.0s)]
*  There's 500 of these made. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=129.0s)]
*  This is 230 something of 500. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=131.0s)]
*  Why doesn't he make more? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=134.0s)]
*  It's not him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=135.0s)]
*  I can't read it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=136.0s)]
*  Inside Jean Paul whoever. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=137.0s)]
*  Oh, so it's like a designer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=140.0s)]

*  Like he'll take this fancy sung glass frame and he'll be like, let's put this tint on it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=154.0s)]
*  Let me do this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=160.0s)]
*  And then you go in and he'll sand it down to fit your nose. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=161.0s)]

*  I mean, it costs money, but I love shit like that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=172.0s)]
*  I love when people take something and make it unique and not everybody has it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=175.0s)]

*  This is our friend Drew. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=341.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=342.72s)]
*  It was Drew's last name, Jamie. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=343.72s)]
*  Who did the table. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=345.72s)]
*  Drew Teague. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=349.72s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker and he made us this table. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  We had another one like this at the old studio, but it was a little bit too big. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=353.76s)]
*  It was enormous. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=356.8s)]
*  And so we had him construct this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=357.8s)]
*  Well, you look at a table like this and you're like, yeah, I could do that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=359.72s)]
*  And then you realize how hard I watch wood stuff on Instagram all the time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=362.34s)]
*  It's my favorite. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=366.7s)]
*  Just seeing some guy taking a tree and making it into something is nuts to me. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=368.08s)]
*  Why is that so satisfying? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=374.14s)]
*  Watching someone carve things out of wood and saw and hammer and nail and make it all [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=376.41999999999996s)]
*  precise. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=379.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=380.9s)]
*  There's so much that goes into it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=381.9s)]
*  And this one dude is just sitting there and it was a tree. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=383.02s)]
*  It was in a forest. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=387.53999999999996s)]
*  And now it's in somebody's house and generations are going to eat off this thing and talk about [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=389.22s)]
*  fucking everything. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=395.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=396.08s)]
*  My table's from the 50s. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=397.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=398.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=399.08s)]
*  We moved into my house up in Westchester. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=400.08s)]
*  They were like, you want to buy this furniture? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=402.98s)]
*  500 bucks because the lady was dying or whatever. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  And she lived in the house her whole life. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=407.76s)]
*  And I looked at it, I'm like 100% because it's mid-century modern furniture. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=409.58s)]
*  The Danish were making this furniture. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=416.98s)]
*  Europe was making these amazing wood furniture. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=420.58s)]
*  Like Mad Men type of furniture. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=423.98s)]
*  And America started making them. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=426.54s)]
*  I was like, this is that stuff. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  So we took it and I found out the table's worth 2,800 bucks. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=429.14s)]
*  The chairs are worth 250 each. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=433.7s)]
*  The liquor cabinet's worth 4,000. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=437.26s)]
*  All the stuff we got was from the 50s when she got it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=439.34s)]
*  And I'm sitting there going, this whole family grew up on this table. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=443.66s)]
*  And now it was very important in my house that when I'm home we have dinner. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=447.86s)]
*  Me and my wife and my son, we sit at the table and we have dinner. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  And I talk because that's the time where- [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=457.02000000000004s)]
*  You bond. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=461.58000000000004s)]
*  You find out about your day. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=462.58000000000004s)]
*  You need a break from your day where you're doing all this shit and now you're going to [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=464.18s)]
*  sit here and just talk. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=469.3s)]
*  No iPads, no homework, no fucking Instagram, no bullshit. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=470.38s)]
*  Just sit down and talk. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=475.84s)]
*  And I'd say, what was the best part? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=476.84s)]
*  What was the worst part of your day? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=478.02s)]
*  This happened. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  Recess, of course. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=482.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm like, no fucking recess. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  Don't count. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  Lunch, nope. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=485.65999999999997s)]
*  Don't count. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=486.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=487.65999999999997s)]
*  And we shit this table. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  And then someone's going to buy this table in 50 years. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=490.62s)]
*  It's probably worth even more. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=493.82s)]
*  It's like you can't recreate a 1950s table. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=495.53999999999996s)]
*  You can make a copy of it, but it's not a 1950s. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=499.9s)]
*  There's something about an old thing that's baked in memories and thoughts. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=503.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=508.26s)]

*  It's like a Rolex. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=531.82s)]
*  When you get a really nice watch, the craftsmanship that goes into that watch, fuck the watch. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=533.1800000000001s)]

*  It's not about that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=539.26s)]
*  There's like- [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=540.54s)]
*  Engineering. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=541.54s)]
*  The engineering of it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=542.54s)]
*  And then when you scratch it for the first time, you get so bummed out. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=543.54s)]
*  But that's your scratch. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=547.54s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=548.54s)]

*  They're going to stay away. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=873.38s)]
*  I just don't have food in your tent. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=874.38s)]
*  You can't do certain things like because we're primitive camping. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=876.26s)]
*  There's nobody around. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=878.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=879.66s)]
*  There's nobody around for four hours. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=880.66s)]
*  How deep did you get in there? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=881.66s)]
*  How far did you walk in? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=882.66s)]

*  Sure. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=897.26s)]
*  It opens up. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=898.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=899.26s)]
*  I cooked everybody rice pilaf. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=900.26s)]
*  We had this sick meal. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=901.26s)]
*  Look at you. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=902.54s)]
*  You guys have reindeer and everything. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=903.54s)]

*  We had the fire. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=909.38s)]
*  How many days you guys stay up there? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=910.38s)]
*  We did one day. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=911.62s)]
*  We went up for one night packed up. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=912.62s)]
*  That's fucking beautiful. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=914.74s)]
*  So we get into the I went early because I'm old. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=915.78s)]
*  So I get in my tent around 1130 around 130. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=918.04s)]
*  I hear them zipping up that tent and they get in and then as soon as they got in their [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=920.38s)]
*  tent a pack of coyotes. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=925.74s)]
*  And I don't know if you've ever heard a pack of coyotes. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=929.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=931.5799999999999s)]
*  I've never heard them. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=932.5799999999999s)]
*  I didn't understand the noise. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=933.5799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't sound it sounds like something's being murdered. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=935.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=937.9399999999999s)]
*  I thought oh, something like that. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=938.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like I. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=940.78s)]
*  It's the scariest fucking sound. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=943.3s)]
*  You know what they're doing when they do that. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=946.86s)]
*  They have roll call. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=947.86s)]
*  Is that what they're doing? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=948.86s)]
*  Yeah, they're making sure either they kill something and they want to let everybody know [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=949.86s)]
*  they killed something. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=953.0999999999999s)]
*  So they let all the other coyotes know or they're doing roll call. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=954.0999999999999s)]
*  And here's what's interesting. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=957.4599999999999s)]
*  When they do roll call, if one of the coyotes doesn't respond, that means the coyote probably [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=959.14s)]
*  got killed. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=963.66s)]
*  And when a coyote gets killed, the female coyotes in the pack produce more litter. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=964.9s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why coyotes are everywhere. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=969.54s)]
*  They're one of the most unusual animals in North America in that when their populations [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=972.38s)]
*  decrease, the female litters increase. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=977.02s)]
*  Like they make more babies and they spread their territory out because they used to be [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=980.06s)]
*  limited to the West. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=984.02s)]
*  But then when in the 1800s and the 1900s, when people started shooting them and running [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=985.58s)]
*  them off, like when they extirpated the wolves, like wolves are basically they were. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=991.3000000000001s)]
*  Did you use the word extirpated? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=997.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=998.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=999.9000000000001s)]
*  When they removed the wolves. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1000.9000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for dumbing it down. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1001.9000000000001s)]
*  When they removed all the wolves, they killed all the wolves in the West. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1003.46s)]
*  When they were doing that to the coyotes, it didn't work. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1007.34s)]
*  The coyotes just spread out. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1010.1s)]
*  And now there's coyotes in every city in America. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1011.86s)]
*  I just saw one that got hit on the West Side Highway. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1015.78s)]
*  Yeah, they're everywhere. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1018.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1019.38s)]
*  They're all in Manhattan. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1020.38s)]
*  They're all over Central Park. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1021.38s)]
*  And then people are like, no way. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1022.8199999999999s)]
*  Like yeah, there's videos of them in the Bronx. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1024.1799999999998s)]
*  They're in my neighborhood. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1025.78s)]
*  In abandoned houses. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1026.78s)]
*  100%. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1027.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1028.78s)]
*  But we were four hours away from anything. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1029.78s)]
*  It's 1.30 in the morning. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1031.5s)]
*  It's me, Ari Shaffir and Joe List. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1032.7s)]
*  Not the Navy SEAL team you're looking for, right? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1035.82s)]
*  You know, I'm huge, right? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1041.26s)]
*  Did you guys bring a firearm or anything? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1043.98s)]
*  I had my knife, my bushcraft knife. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1045.54s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1049.06s)]
*  I already had one. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1050.06s)]
*  I gave Joe List my broken buck knife that he didn't know was broken. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1051.06s)]
*  And I had bear spray. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1055.14s)]
*  I took bear spray just in case. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1056.14s)]
*  And I mean, they screamed. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1059.02s)]
*  It was terrifying. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1061.02s)]
*  Terrifying. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1062.02s)]
*  The noise is terrifying. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1063.02s)]
*  And then right when it stopped, Joe List went, what do we do about that? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1064.14s)]
*  And then my pad, my sleeping pad broke. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1070.42s)]
*  It just pops. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1076.46s)]
*  Oh, you got one of those air pads? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1077.46s)]
*  I'm huge at the time. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1079.46s)]
*  I'm fucking massive. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1081.46s)]
*  It wasn't my weight. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1082.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1083.46s)]
*  It just popped it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1084.46s)]
*  So I got to keep rolling around all night. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1086.1399999999999s)]
*  Ari keeps hearing me roll around trying to get my pad together and he thinks I'm being [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1088.74s)]
*  attacked. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1092.3799999999999s)]
*  So Ari in the middle of the night, Bobby, what the fuck's happening? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1093.3799999999999s)]

*  I didn't tell you. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1274.84s)]

*  Very skeptical. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1377.52s)]
*  It's such a great cigar. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1378.52s)]
*  I mean, it's one of my favorites, and it's crazy you can't even get it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1379.72s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1383.16s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1384.16s)]
*  This is it right here. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1385.16s)]
*  So give me some volume here. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1386.16s)]
*  So this is, it's like just at the end of the day. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1387.44s)]
*  Amen. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1391.96s)]
*  Amen. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1392.96s)]
*  So I'm just walking up to it, trying to film it. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1393.96s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1399.16s)]
*  And I'm like, nope, got to go. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1400.16s)]
*  See you. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1403.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1404.8s)]
*  I love it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1406.8s)]
*  Anytime somebody sees an animal, we always talk to them like it's like a surfer. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1407.8s)]
*  Hey, what's up, dude? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1411.3999999999999s)]
*  What up, bro? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1412.3999999999999s)]
*  Hey, bro. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1413.3999999999999s)]
*  Hey, man. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1414.3999999999999s)]
*  You cool, dude? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1415.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you're not cool? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1416.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1417.3999999999999s)]
*  I'd never seen one in a while before. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1418.3999999999999s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1419.3999999999999s)]
*  They're just such an interesting looking, like a little pit bull covered in fur. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  It's funny because I bought a tiny house, I was telling you, up in New Hampshire, and [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1423.44s)]
*  I want to see animals so bad. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1430.3999999999999s)]
*  We go up in the summertime for two months. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1432.84s)]
*  You don't see anything up there? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1435.36s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1437.6399999999999s)]
*  I saw a deer, but I know there's bear. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1438.6399999999999s)]
*  I know there's a lot of bear. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1441.8s)]
*  I know there's a lot of meerkats and mountain lions and stuff like that, but I haven't seen [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1443.1999999999998s)]
*  them. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1447.4399999999998s)]
*  When you want to see them is when you don't see them. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1448.4399999999998s)]
*  There's moose up there too. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1450.04s)]
*  Moose. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1451.04s)]
*  There's everything up there. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1452.04s)]
*  There was more animal sightings in Westchester on my Ring Cam than there was. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1453.04s)]
*  The deer. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1459.1599999999999s)]
*  Deer in Westchester are off the charts. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1460.1599999999999s)]
*  There's bear too. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1461.76s)]
*  There's bear. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1463.36s)]
*  There's a bobcat. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1464.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1465.36s)]
*  There's a bobcat. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1466.36s)]
*  There's coyote everywhere. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1467.36s)]
*  They have a real bear problem in New Jersey. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1468.36s)]
*  You want to know about this? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1472.72s)]
*  This is kind of crazy. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1474.12s)]
*  The highest population of bears in the entire country is in New Jersey. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1475.12s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1480.56s)]
*  There's more bears per capita in New Jersey. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1481.56s)]
*  Because you can't kill them. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1484.36s)]
*  Because you can't kill them now. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1485.36s)]
*  They used to be able to until this new governor. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1486.36s)]
*  This new governor came along and said, let's stop the bear hunts. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1488.5s)]
*  They're teddy bears and they're yogi and they're our friends. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1491.94s)]
*  Did you see the video? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1495.7s)]
*  I posted the video on my Instagram yesterday of a hiker. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1496.9s)]
*  He's climbing up this mountain and the bear comes down the mountain and tries to eat him. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1499.86s)]
*  Yeah I saw that. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1505.18s)]
*  He's kicking it. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1506.18s)]
*  And he's screaming and the noises this guy makes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1507.18s)]
*  Pull that up. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1509.34s)]
*  The noises this guy makes are so fucking primal. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1510.34s)]
*  He's like, ahhh! [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1513.7s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1514.7s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1515.7s)]
*  Give me a sec. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1516.7s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1517.7s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1518.7s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1519.7s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1520.7s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1521.7s)]
*  That's a small bear too. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1524.94s)]
*  He's lucky. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1526.3s)]
*  That's probably like a six foot bear. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1527.3s)]
*  I can't fuck with him though dude. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1530.6200000000001s)]
*  Because you'd think you'd do something. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1532.3s)]
*  No. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1534.6200000000001s)]
*  There's not much he can do. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1535.6200000000001s)]
*  It was really interesting. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1536.9s)]
*  You play it again because at the beginning of it, he's um, he's, it comes right down [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1537.9s)]
*  at him. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1542.82s)]
*  Right down from the top and tries to bite him and then runs back at him. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1544.08s)]
*  He's lucky he had the high ground after that. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1550.28s)]
*  He kicks like a bitch too. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1552.1599999999999s)]
*  He's lucky. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1553.32s)]
*  He's lucky that bear did just bite his foot off. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1554.32s)]
*  Poor guy man. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1557.8s)]
*  Those noises. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1560.22s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1561.22s)]
*  Those noises are so primal. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1563.0s)]
*  Poor dude. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1565.1599999999999s)]
*  Is that what you call it? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1566.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1567.1599999999999s)]
*  Primal? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1568.1599999999999s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1569.1599999999999s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1570.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, Anthony Cumi sent me a text message this morning. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1571.1599999999999s)]
*  It was like, that's like what you would, like caveman noises. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1572.56s)]
*  You'd expect a caveman like AHHH! [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1575.36s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1577.36s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1578.36s)]
*  That's what it sounds like. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1579.36s)]
*  It's like the fucking, the DNA of you. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1580.36s)]
*  Like the, forget about your language. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1582.56s)]
*  Just noise. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1585.28s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1586.28s)]
*  AHHH! [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1587.28s)]
*  Because you don't know, I always think I know what I do. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1588.28s)]
*  Bear. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1591.32s)]
*  Bear. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1592.32s)]
*  You know, you're supposed to, you see the bear, back bear. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1593.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1595.3999999999999s)]
*  Like in my head. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  But if that happened to me, I'd probably make the same. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1597.3999999999999s)]
*  A hundred percent I'd make that noise. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1598.9199999999998s)]
*  Probably a little higher pitched. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1600.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, a hundred percent I'd have a gun. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1601.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1603.52s)]
*  So I'd shoot that thing right in the fucking face. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1604.52s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1606.24s)]
*  You know, you can only kick them so many times. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1607.24s)]
*  Like if you have a gun on you, that's way better. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1610.2s)]
*  That situation is scary. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1614.1200000000001s)]
*  Because people get eaten by bears all the time. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1615.4s)]
*  It is a common occurrence. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1618.76s)]
*  But bear spray, I heard this, bear spray is less effective than regular mace. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1620.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1627.16s)]
*  Because they don't want to, we can go wash our eyes out. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1628.6s)]
*  Bears can't. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=1631.7199999999998s)]

*  But I'm like, when that happened, I lost 55 shows in one night. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2407.22s)]
*  I had a theater tour going with Creeps with Kids. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2411.1s)]
*  Ron Bennington, Voss, Florentine and me were doing this great theater thing that was sold [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2413.74s)]
*  out. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2418.18s)]
*  And it all went away in one night. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2419.38s)]
*  I got a call from my agent, Matt Frost. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2421.06s)]
*  He's like, dude, it's all gone. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2423.02s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2424.7000000000003s)]
*  He goes, all your shows. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2425.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's like, dude, I'm a club guy too. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2426.7000000000003s)]
*  So I finally had a theater tour that was successful. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2430.94s)]
*  I was kind of crawling my way. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2433.9s)]
*  And I finally had that, like, all right, let's do this. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2435.98s)]
*  This is great. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2439.2200000000003s)]
*  And it was gone. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2440.86s)]
*  So Florida saved my ass. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2442.58s)]
*  Side splitters, Vasanis, McCurdy's, you know, all these clubs down there, I could go down [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2445.7799999999997s)]
*  and fill the place up and do shows. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2451.7s)]
*  So I was like, I got to go down there and do this. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2454.3399999999997s)]
*  And Mike Kalter, you know, promoted the fuck out of it. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2456.58s)]
*  So it was one of the only places where you could do shows. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2459.1s)]
*  It was one of the only places you could do shows, but you could do shows without without [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2461.66s)]
*  the masks. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2464.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2465.2599999999998s)]
*  Because to be honest, dude, I'd rather not perform than I can't. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2466.2599999999998s)]
*  I need your mouth. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2471.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2472.8199999999997s)]
*  I need your mouth. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2473.8199999999997s)]
*  Because other than that, the eyebrow movement is the same as a great joke or you're offended. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2474.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2480.1000000000004s)]
*  And you hear, bleh. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2482.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if you hate me or love me. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2485.1000000000004s)]
*  It's the same Muppet shit. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2487.54s)]
*  Laughter through a mask is very strange. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2489.34s)]
*  It was the worst. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2491.34s)]
*  I only did one show with people with masks on in the crowd. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2492.34s)]
*  Well, I did a few outside with Chappelle where they were supposed to have masks on, but people [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2495.5800000000004s)]
*  didn't really have masks on. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2499.7000000000003s)]
*  Most people were like, fuck it, because it was in Texas. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2501.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2503.06s)]
*  It was peak pandemic. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2504.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2505.2999999999997s)]
*  But I did a show in Houston. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2506.2999999999997s)]
*  We did the improv in Houston when you were still allowed to do shows indoors and people [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2509.66s)]
*  had masks on. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2514.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2515.86s)]
*  It was very strange. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2516.86s)]
*  Oh, the special dude, it was so funny. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2517.86s)]
*  Nobody gave a fuck. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2519.66s)]
*  We jammed them in there like sardines. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2520.7s)]
*  Nobody gave a shit. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2523.14s)]
*  When was this? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2524.14s)]
*  When did you film it? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2525.14s)]
*  We filmed it, I think in March. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2526.14s)]
*  Yeah, March. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2527.14s)]
*  Yeah, March. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2528.22s)]
*  We went down there one night, rocked it out, and then Louis put it on his website, man, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2529.22s)]
*  which is nuts. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2535.9s)]
*  It's great. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2536.9s)]
*  Because he's creating his own. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2537.9s)]
*  It's like, okay, I love that we don't have to ask. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2538.9s)]
*  I don't have to get a yes anymore. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2541.46s)]
*  It's like, all right, you don't like me, whatever the fuck reason, Netflix, whoever, it's fine. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2542.94s)]
*  I'm cool. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2548.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't hate, you know what I mean? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2549.3399999999997s)]
*  It's like, fuck them. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2551.54s)]
*  I don't have time for that shit. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2552.54s)]
*  I couldn't afford to do it the way I wanted to do it. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2556.34s)]
*  I know I could do it another way, but I wanted it to be special. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2559.94s)]
*  I believe that I wanted it to be special. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2563.78s)]
*  This was in my head, that Elvis comeback special was always like, that's the baddest Elvis [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2567.02s)]
*  ever. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2571.54s)]
*  Granted, I was Elvis at the end of his career, not really at that time when he was peak. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2572.54s)]
*  And Louis, this is why I love him, man. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2578.78s)]
*  He's like, I got it. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2581.58s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2583.6200000000003s)]
*  I was like, great. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2585.1s)]
*  And he did it. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2586.58s)]
*  And he directed it. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2587.58s)]
*  Because at one point he was like, we're going to maybe do this. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2588.58s)]
*  I go, dude, I don't care if you're fucking using an iPhone. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2590.42s)]
*  As long as your eye is looking through that camera, that's what I want. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2592.8199999999997s)]
*  Because I know what you know. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2598.5s)]
*  You're one of the best. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2600.38s)]
*  I had one of the best standup comics walking today. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2601.98s)]
*  Ever. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2605.22s)]
*  Ever, but alive right now. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2606.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2609.22s)]
*  Directing your special. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2610.22s)]
*  Paying for it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2612.22s)]
*  Paying for it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2613.22s)]
*  Producing it. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2614.8199999999997s)]
*  Producing it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2615.8199999999997s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2616.8199999999997s)]
*  I can't tell you how amazing that was. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2617.8199999999997s)]
*  The pressure's on too, because if you suck, you've got to waste his money and his time. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2621.4199999999996s)]
*  And he put it on his website, which is nuts. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2627.1s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2629.02s)]
*  People covet. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2630.9399999999996s)]
*  When you get it, it's hard not to covet it because you're so afraid of losing it. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2631.9399999999996s)]
*  But he's creating his own Netflix on his website. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2637.74s)]
*  The movie's there. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2641.5s)]
*  His TV show's there. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2642.5s)]
*  His specials are all there. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2644.62s)]
*  You can go there and pick what you want. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2646.14s)]
*  My special's there. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2647.3799999999997s)]
*  It's crazy that it's on there. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2649.66s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2651.22s)]
*  What he's doing is brilliant. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2652.22s)]
*  And it's a perfect answer to the problems that he faced after getting canceled. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2653.22s)]
*  I brought him to my club. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2657.14s)]
*  I bought a club in Austin. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2658.8199999999997s)]
*  And I brought him there right when we were about to pour cement. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2660.58s)]
*  And he was like, make the stage shorter. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2663.58s)]
*  Drop the ceiling down even lower. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2665.94s)]
*  Do this, do that. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2667.66s)]
*  I'm like, whatever he says. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2668.66s)]
*  Just do whatever he says. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2669.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2670.66s)]
*  I just said, what else do you think? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2671.66s)]
*  So all the ideas that he had, we implemented all of them. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2673.46s)]
*  They were perfect ideas. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2676.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2677.62s)]
*  The stage was a little too big in the small room. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2678.62s)]
*  We have a small room that's like 120 people. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2679.9s)]
*  He's like, why is the stage so big? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2681.54s)]
*  It should be smaller. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2683.14s)]
*  I'm like, you're right. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2684.14s)]
*  It should be smaller. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2685.14s)]
*  How much smaller? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2686.14s)]
*  Cut it down here. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2687.14s)]
*  I'm like, let's do it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2688.14s)]
*  He has an eye for things. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2689.14s)]
*  He's like he shouldn't be doing comedy. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2690.46s)]

*  I don't have that. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2751.06s)]
*  I remember I saw you on MTV's comedy half hour and you were talking about how much pressure [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2753.58s)]
*  you apply to push a girl's ... I mean, is there a thing? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2763.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2773.1s)]
*  Oh, it was when a girl's like, I go, she's like kissing your lips and kissing your neck, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2774.1s)]
*  but she's spending way too much time in this particular area. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2778.8999999999996s)]
*  You're trying to encourage this downward trajectory of her affection. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2784.02s)]
*  So you're arching your back and you're putting your hand on your head, but you don't know [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2788.18s)]
*  how hard you can push her head before she gets mad. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2792.74s)]
*  It was fucking genius to me because every guy has been through that because you don't [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2795.7s)]
*  want to be a fucking asshole. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2800.7s)]
*  But it's like, dude, this is doing nothing. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2802.7s)]
*  My nipples, I don't like it. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2805.74s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2807.46s)]
*  I was like, that's it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2809.26s)]
*  I go, that's what I want to do. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2810.26s)]
*  That's the fucking comedy. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2811.86s)]
*  That exists. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2813.66s)]
*  But we were stuck in a time where there was a transitionary period between doing sets [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2814.66s)]
*  for The Tonight Show, which made careers. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2820.1s)]
*  Back then, Steven Wright got on The Tonight Show, Richard Jenney, these guys got on The [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2823.26s)]
*  Tonight Show and it made their careers. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2827.46s)]
*  Everybody knew them from The Tonight Show. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2829.54s)]
*  But there was guys like you and me that were stuck in this ... We were wild kids and we [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2831.38s)]
*  were like early 20s and we were like, that's not what I think about. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2836.54s)]
*  I remember there was a guy that I worked with at Nick's Comedy Stop and he was telling me [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2840.54s)]
*  this, you got to clean it up. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2844.62s)]
*  You got to stop saying fuck. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2845.62s)]
*  You got to do this. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2846.62s)]
*  I go, but my favorite comics are like Dice Clay and he goes, so you're not Dice Clay. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2847.62s)]
*  I go, well, Dice Clay wasn't Dice Clay until he became Dice Clay. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2852.62s)]
*  That's what I want to do. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2857.42s)]
*  I don't want to do what you're doing. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2858.42s)]
*  Get it in your fucking head. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2860.54s)]
*  That's not what I want to do. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2861.7s)]
*  He's like, well, you're going to work shit rooms. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2862.7s)]
*  Well, that's what I have to do then because this is the comedy I want to do. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2865.5s)]
*  I want to do comedy like Kinnison and Hicks and that's what I wanted to do. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2868.86s)]
*  I wanted to do wild shit. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2873.42s)]
*  That was the shit I liked. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2874.7s)]
*  It was like being in a rock and roll band and someone tells you you have to play classical [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2876.1s)]
*  music. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2879.22s)]
*  No, I want ACDC. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2880.22s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2881.22s)]
*  I like Highway to Hell. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2882.22s)]
*  Well, it is more profitable. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2883.22s)]
*  Back then it was. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2886.22s)]
*  And even now. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2888.34s)]
*  No, not anymore. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2889.34s)]
*  Well, I think there is certain things you could do. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2890.34s)]
*  The Tonight Show and all that stuff, I get it. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2893.46s)]
*  But you could make a little more money. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2895.1s)]
*  Instagram will fucking flag your shit. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2899.62s)]
*  If you're telling clean stuff, it can go to everywhere. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2903.46s)]
*  Even on serious radio. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2906.1400000000003s)]
*  If you do a clean album, you'll make way more money. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2907.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but YouTube, if you have a set like Schultz or someone like that, his set got [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2910.06s)]
*  banned from a streaming website. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2915.06s)]
*  One of the streamers. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2919.42s)]
*  That was good. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2920.42s)]
*  That was a nice catch. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2921.42s)]
*  He said, you got to edit this. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2922.46s)]
*  And he's like, I'm not editing it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2923.46s)]
*  So I'm going to release it on my own website. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2924.66s)]
*  Then I'll just put it on YouTube. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2926.1800000000003s)]

*  Kanye is losing his mind. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2937.02s)]
*  He's helped me a lot with this too. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2939.94s)]
*  He actually, I did his podcast, but he came up, he goes, give me, I want your clip person. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2941.14s)]

*  And he is a hundred percent right. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2956.14s)]
*  He figured it out and he shares that information if you want it. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2957.92s)]

*  He's like a classic Hollywood star from back in the day to his looks. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2980.66s)]

*  This week, Kanye went on a media blitzkrieg. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2986.74s)]
*  He threw so many stones at the Jews, he's now an honorary general in the West Bank, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=2989.14s)]

*  So what exactly did Ye say? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3002.3399999999997s)]

*  Wrong. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3018.74s)]
*  Kanye, we have video evidence of a throat getting crushed and don't worry, Kim's not [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3019.74s)]
*  in it. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3023.66s)]
*  He blamed the Jews for trying to silence him. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3024.66s)]
*  Ye, the only Jew that's ever kept your mouth shut was the dentist that wired your jaw. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3026.7s)]
*  I hear some people saying Kanye did bring up some very strong points. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3031.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes, these points. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3035.62s)]
*  That's it. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3037.2999999999997s)]
*  Kanye isn't the free thinker he claims to be. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3038.46s)]
*  He just regurgitates the talking points of the latest pseudo-intellectual leech around [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3041.26s)]
*  him. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3045.82s)]
*  The only original thoughts Kanye's ever had are Amber, Kim, and Julia. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3046.82s)]
*  So is Kanye insane? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3050.54s)]
*  Selfishly, I hope he is. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3052.46s)]
*  I'd rather believe this is the behavior of a guy battling bipolar disorder than accept [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3054.2200000000003s)]
*  I've been supporting a black skinhead for decades. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3058.86s)]
*  So my message to you chipmunk cheeks is simple. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3061.54s)]
*  Get better. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3064.34s)]
*  Better friends. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3065.34s)]
*  Better therapists. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3066.34s)]
*  Better perspective on the world and better meds and good luck because you're going to [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3067.66s)]
*  need it. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3072.3799999999997s)]
*  He's so good, man. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3073.3799999999997s)]
*  That thing that he did, the America series that he did on Netflix, like that, those fast [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3075.7s)]
*  pace, he developed a new kind of standup that you could do with no audience on Instagram [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3081.42s)]
*  because he doesn't have to wait for the laughs. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3086.98s)]
*  So he just hammers you, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3089.14s)]
*  Because when people were doing Zoom standup, it was terrible because there's no laughter [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3092.02s)]
*  because there's no audience. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3096.3799999999997s)]
*  So what he figured out how to do is get rapid fire punch lines so that when you're watching [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3098.1s)]
*  it on your phone, it's fucking genius. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3103.42s)]
*  So he starts it on his phone. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3105.9s)]
*  Remember turn your phone sideways. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3107.1800000000003s)]
*  He does that. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3108.1800000000003s)]
*  That's great. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3109.1800000000003s)]
*  It annoyed me. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3110.1800000000003s)]
*  I texted him. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3111.1800000000003s)]
*  I go, dude, I fuck, I want to hit you with a shovel because I literally was like, ugh, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3112.1800000000003s)]
*  I got to turn it. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3116.02s)]
*  I got to watch it. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3117.02s)]
*  And then he takes that and does it to Netflix. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3118.42s)]
*  And it was fucking genius. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3121.5s)]
*  It was a great move during the pandemic. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3122.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's guys like him who figured it out. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3125.46s)]
*  And I love that. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3127.78s)]
*  That's why this thing with Louis, it's like I can do this and get it out there and people [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3129.1800000000003s)]
*  can go buy it. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3135.9s)]
*  And we don't have to ask. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3136.9s)]
*  Yeah, you don't have to do anything. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3137.9s)]
*  That's the future because these fucking people that were the gatekeepers, they don't know [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3140.1000000000004s)]
*  what they're doing. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3144.5800000000004s)]
*  They just don't. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3145.78s)]
*  They are executives. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3146.78s)]
*  They're not artists. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3148.5s)]
*  They're not comedians. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3149.7400000000002s)]
*  They're not funny. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3151.02s)]
*  So if they are funny, they've never done standup. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3152.02s)]
*  If they'd done standup, they'd be doing standup. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3154.02s)]
*  That's not what they do. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3155.94s)]
*  So them telling you to do that is like me telling someone how to play football. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3156.94s)]
*  I don't play football. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3160.5s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck to tell you. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3161.5s)]
*  I can say what you should do, but I'm probably going to be wrong. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3162.7400000000002s)]
*  These guys, they just get in the way. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3166.1s)]
*  And so to have someone who does it like Louis or like Schultz or like someone like that, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3168.38s)]
*  that's what we need. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3173.46s)]
*  That's the future. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3174.46s)]
*  Well, it's funny too, because like Louis said to me, I was like, dude, I got this whole [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3175.46s)]
*  thing on weight. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3178.1400000000003s)]
*  He's like, I don't want that. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3179.1400000000003s)]
*  I want you to just kill. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3180.82s)]
*  I want you to do a club set. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3182.7s)]
*  Like you're at a club and kill for an hour. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3184.66s)]
*  That's all I want out of you. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3187.06s)]
*  I go, I got that hour. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3188.06s)]
*  I got it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3189.2999999999997s)]
*  It's like, so this is a, it's not like that theater where you do and the thing swoops [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3190.2999999999997s)]
*  in and you deliver the thing and you look. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3195.74s)]
*  No, it looks great. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3197.8999999999996s)]
*  It looks perfect. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3198.8999999999996s)]
*  I love it. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3199.8999999999996s)]
*  I love that this is a thing now that people are just figuring that out. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3200.8999999999996s)]
*  And Louis really is at the front of the line of that shit. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3205.42s)]
*  Louis and Schultz. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3207.94s)]
*  And Schultz, absolutely. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3208.94s)]
*  This is the future. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3210.12s)]
*  The future is not these fucking gatekeepers and executives. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3211.4s)]
*  All those people are like, if you say some wild shit on a special and then someone tries [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3215.0s)]
*  to bring it to a streaming service and then the people start getting upset and protesting, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3220.08s)]
*  that's on them. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3225.6s)]
*  Who greenlit this? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3226.68s)]
*  Who said Bobby Kelly can say these things? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3227.68s)]
*  I get it from their perspective. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3230.44s)]
*  They've got mortgages and kids in private school. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3232.24s)]
*  I know what the fuck is going on, but that doesn't help us. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3234.24s)]
*  It doesn't help the people. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3237.44s)]
*  No. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3239.24s)]
*  You're seeing stuff that you might think would be offensive, but you laugh at it and that's [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3240.3599999999997s)]
*  our job. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3244.2s)]
*  Well, also, how many people are complaining versus how many people are enjoying it. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3245.2s)]
*  It's a lack of perspective because they're only paying attention to the people that are [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3249.8399999999997s)]
*  writing emails and making these fucking campaigns. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3253.3199999999997s)]
*  And those people are losers for the most part. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3256.4799999999996s)]
*  The people that get upset at a comedian telling jokes to the point where they want to contact [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3260.24s)]
*  sponsors and contact banks, they don't have anything going on with their life. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3264.52s)]
*  Their thing is to try to get some sort of a result out of their efforts and their efforts [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3268.8399999999997s)]
*  are negative to cancel you. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3274.48s)]
*  If you don't like it, you don't have to listen. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3276.12s)]
*  If you don't like a Quentin Tarantino movie where Brad Pitt smashes a woman's face on [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3278.72s)]
*  a mantelpiece, don't watch it. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3282.7799999999997s)]
*  But that's the movie. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3285.68s)]
*  That's the art. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3287.24s)]
*  There's a lot of films that I don't like. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3288.24s)]
*  There's a lot of rap lyrics that I don't agree with. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3290.96s)]
*  But that's fine. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3293.92s)]
*  You don't have to listen. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3295.06s)]
*  You don't have to watch it. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3296.08s)]
*  Today's kids, these activist minded kids think that they have some sort of a civil civic [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3298.44s)]
*  duty to try to remove you from the entertainment ecosphere. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3304.76s)]
*  And this is what they have to deal with if they're at Netflix or if they're at any of [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3310.68s)]
*  these places. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3313.96s)]
*  Well, they made comedy punk rock again. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3314.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3316.76s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3317.76s)]
*  They made us punk and it's like you did the wrong thing. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3318.76s)]
*  You did the wrong thing because now we're just going to go do it ourselves. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3321.8s)]
*  I remember we were trying to come up with a name for the special. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3324.0s)]
*  And I said, he's like, what do you got? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3327.8s)]
*  I was like, can we call it Remember AIDS? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3330.08s)]
*  Because that's one of my jokes. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3336.04s)]
*  And he goes, yeah. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3337.04s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to call it that. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3338.04s)]

*  You can call it fucking dead crack babies. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3345.36s)]
*  I love his last special's name, Sorry. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3346.36s)]
*  It was the greatest with it behind him. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3348.36s)]
*  The giant sorry behind him. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3350.56s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3352.36s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3353.7200000000003s)]
*  I was like, dude, where is the sorry? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3354.7200000000003s)]
*  I want that. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3356.1600000000003s)]
*  He threw it out. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3357.1600000000003s)]
*  I was like, I would have put that threw it out to a giant sorry. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3358.1600000000003s)]
*  I was like, I would have put that on my like my land in New Hampshire. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3361.88s)]
*  I would have put it in the woods just in the back like hikers. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3364.44s)]
*  Rusty covered with leaves. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3367.96s)]
*  Could you imagine be a hiker just walking through the woods? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3369.52s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3372.4s)]
*  Every fucking episode. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3373.4s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3374.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3375.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3376.4s)]
*  He's great. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3377.4s)]
*  It's the whole thing is this whole thing that they pushed us into this corner. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3378.4s)]
*  And now we're just doing we're just helping each other. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3382.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3385.3599999999997s)]
*  Which is amazing to me. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3386.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like, all right, we don't need you anymore. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3387.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, it happened at the perfect time because these all these things sort of combined together. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3388.3599999999997s)]
*  And one of the things that happened was the internet. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3391.9599999999996s)]
*  And through the internet, we no longer are competing against each other. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3394.8399999999997s)]
*  So we're all now assets to each other. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3399.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3401.64s)]
*  Because like we do each other's podcasts, we support each other stand up. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3402.64s)]
*  Like if someone's got some cool shit, I put it up on my Instagram. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3406.08s)]
*  All that stuff just helps everybody. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3409.04s)]
*  And instead of like the like when I was coming up in the 90s, when you would get on a sitcom, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3412.36s)]
*  like I remember there was like all this resentment from other people that I knew that like had [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3417.04s)]
*  agents that sent them out for the same roles. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3422.12s)]
*  So we would you know, like we're all like kind of the same age. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3425.2s)]
*  And there's like a guy who's like a fucking character on a sitcom. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3429.36s)]
*  You're going up for it. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3432.84s)]
*  He's going up for it. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3433.92s)]
*  And if he gets it, you're like, fuck, that could have been me. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3435.06s)]
*  And you see him on the CBS promo smiling. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3438.6s)]
*  You're like, oh, that could have been me. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3441.92s)]
*  I remember when Kevin James got his sitcom and when he was he was there were like playing [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3443.96s)]
*  these ads for the sitcom. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3450.6s)]
*  And I remember some comedians like that's like fucking fuck that show. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3451.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's not like you're saying that because you wish it was you. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3454.72s)]
*  Like what are you talking about? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3457.64s)]
*  You don't think it's funny. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3459.2799999999997s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3460.2799999999997s)]
*  Watch it. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3461.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a funny show. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3462.2799999999997s)]
*  You're only upset because you feel like because someone else is successful somehow or another. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3463.2799999999997s)]
*  It took something away from you. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3467.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3469.0s)]
*  But it doesn't change the fact that it's successful. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3470.0s)]
*  You're only damaging your own mind by thinking that way. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3471.96s)]
*  Well, success, they kind of mind fuck you with the success thing because you it's it's [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3475.32s)]
*  it's you have the potential to have dreams come true. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3481.7599999999998s)]
*  Things you felt as a little kid or places you wanted to go or things you wanted to get [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3486.36s)]
*  or the life you wanted is this potential that that could happen in this business. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3490.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3496.32s)]
*  If I was a painter, I mean, you're going to paint. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3498.0800000000004s)]
*  But in this business, you could become that thing that you dreamed about as a kid. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3500.2400000000002s)]
*  And there's a time when you have to realize, at least for me, where I looked around one [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3506.04s)]
*  day and I'm trying to become this thing. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3512.28s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm successful right now. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3516.0s)]
*  I have a house. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3519.2400000000002s)]
*  I got a wife. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3520.56s)]
*  I got a son. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3521.84s)]
*  I have two cars. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3522.84s)]
*  You know, one's a truck and one's a Honda CRV. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3525.36s)]
*  But I have it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3529.1200000000003s)]
*  I have all this stuff. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3530.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm talking shit. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3531.32s)]
*  I'm talking shit. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3532.32s)]
*  I did it. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3535.0s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3536.0s)]
*  Whatever whatever else I have gravy is gravy. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3537.0s)]
*  I have friends, real friends. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3541.4s)]
*  And I'm like, I did it. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3546.0s)]
*  That's making it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3547.52s)]
*  That's making it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3548.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3549.76s)]
*  And I can go on any stage and fucking make people laugh. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3550.76s)]
*  And you know what the opposite of that is? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3553.24s)]
*  There's people that are very successful. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3554.92s)]
*  They're very famous. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3557.2s)]
*  They have shows. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3558.56s)]
*  They have this. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3559.56s)]
*  They have that. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3560.56s)]
*  And no one likes them. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3561.56s)]
*  They're the opposite. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3562.56s)]
*  That's not making it. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3563.68s)]
*  It's not. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3564.96s)]
*  You think you're making it because on paper you're successful. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3565.96s)]
*  So you're always trying to compare your success to other people's success. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3568.42s)]
*  And you're always trying to stay ahead of them because it's the only thing you have. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3572.6s)]
*  Because you don't have the friends and you don't have the family and you don't have love [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3575.88s)]
*  from your peers and like just fun times hanging out, talking shit. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3579.6800000000003s)]
*  You don't have gratitude. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3583.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3584.76s)]
*  You don't. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3585.76s)]
*  Every day I wake up in the morning and I don't touch my phone. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3586.76s)]
*  First thing I was touching my phone. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3590.28s)]
*  I don't touch it. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3592.92s)]
*  I sit on my bed and I think about what I'm grateful for. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3593.92s)]
*  Usually my kid, my wife, my friends, my family. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3597.88s)]
*  And all of a sudden I smile. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3601.96s)]
*  Every day I start to smile. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3604.1200000000003s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3605.92s)]
*  And then I go about my day. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3607.1600000000003s)]
*  Because if I wake up and I just go and I grab the wheel and I just start, I fucking [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3609.08s)]
*  smash into shit. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3615.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3616.4s)]
*  You're on momentum then. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3617.4s)]
*  If I wake up and just take that five or ten minutes to just think about all the great [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3618.56s)]
*  shit that I'm grateful for. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3623.24s)]
*  And it's not any fame. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3625.88s)]
*  It never goes there. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3629.2s)]
*  It always starts with my son. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3630.7999999999997s)]
*  And then it goes to my wife and things around like us, things we're going to do. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3633.08s)]
*  And I'm like, oh. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3638.52s)]
*  And I just start to smile. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3639.52s)]
*  And then I'm good. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3641.24s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3642.24s)]
*  If I don't do that, I'm yelling at somebody or I'm fucking angry. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3643.24s)]

*  He woke up. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3909.56s)]
*  He had all camo and he was out in the woods with his bow and arrow just walking around. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3910.56s)]
*  And I was like, fucking thank you. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3914.4399999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3917.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, great. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3918.3199999999997s)]
*  And and you don't need anything, dude. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3919.3199999999997s)]
*  You don't need it. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3921.72s)]
*  I want to learn when I went to L.A. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3922.74s)]
*  Remember pilot season? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3923.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3924.74s)]
*  So anxiety filled. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3925.74s)]
*  Yeah, there was like, it's three months. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3926.74s)]
*  You'd have to go to L.A. for pilot season because that's where they did all the casting. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3930.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3934.2999999999997s)]
*  I first went in 93. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3935.2999999999997s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3936.2999999999997s)]
*  It was so weird. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3937.2999999999997s)]
*  I remember I went out there. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3938.2999999999997s)]
*  I rented an apartment in West Hollywood and there was one fork, one spoon, one knife, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3940.02s)]
*  one plate, one bowl, one cup. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3946.98s)]
*  Was it one of those apartments like, what are they called? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3950.38s)]
*  Oakwoods. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3953.52s)]
*  Remember those? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3954.52s)]
*  You know, they had those prefab places. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3955.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3957.76s)]
*  That's where I stayed when I first moved there. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3958.76s)]
*  Norton stayed there too and he had cockroaches. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3960.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3962.44s)]
*  Everything. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3963.44s)]
*  No, this is a dude's apartment. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3964.44s)]
*  Oh, above a garage. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3965.88s)]
*  Oh, so you just. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3966.88s)]
*  It's like an Airbnb. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3967.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3968.88s)]
*  And I realized that's all you need is one. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3969.88s)]
*  I need one fork. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3972.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3973.92s)]
*  I need one spoon. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3974.92s)]
*  I don't need. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3975.92s)]
*  Yeah, just wash it. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3976.92s)]
*  Seventy five. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3977.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3978.92s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3980.46s)]
*  We don't need it. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3981.46s)]
*  We don't need all the space. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3983.06s)]
*  It's true. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3984.06s)]
*  We don't need all this shit. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3985.06s)]
*  We're together. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3986.06s)]
*  I mean, you have to love your family. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3987.06s)]
*  If you get a tiny home, you can't love your son and like your wife. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3988.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3991.9s)]
*  Because you're a murderer. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3992.9s)]
*  If you kind of like your wife, get a house. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3993.9s)]
*  Get a place he can hide. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3996.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=3999.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4000.26s)]
*  But it was so. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4001.26s)]
*  You never even think about it. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4002.26s)]
*  I remember when I first moved to LA, it was in 94. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4003.38s)]
*  I got an apartment in North Hollywood and it was a nice apartment with a loft and I [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4007.7400000000002s)]
*  had a pool table in my apartment and I would come home to my apartment. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4011.94s)]
*  I'm like, this is crazy. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4015.7400000000002s)]
*  I can't believe I live here. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4016.7400000000002s)]
*  This is amazing. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4018.42s)]
*  And then after a while, I got used to it. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4019.6600000000003s)]
*  And then I remember sitting down on the floor of my apartment one day going, oh, okay. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4021.6600000000003s)]
*  It's just home. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4026.46s)]
*  Like you get used to everything. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4027.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4028.9s)]
*  And even if you're like, like now I live in a really nice house, but it's just a house. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4029.9s)]
*  You get used to it. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4034.5s)]
*  You know? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4035.5s)]
*  Like every, it's just home. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4036.56s)]
*  Like most things like that, like big, giant, crazy things, they're very overrated. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4038.84s)]
*  They're not worth the effort that it takes to acquire them and you don't get the level [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4044.56s)]
*  of satisfaction out of having them that you think you would. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4048.32s)]
*  There's some things you're going to enjoy in life. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4052.04s)]
*  Like there's some things that I still enjoy. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4054.32s)]
*  I still enjoy cars. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4056.0s)]
*  Like I still enjoy hot rods and I still enjoy, like I get a wild thrill out of driving them. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4057.36s)]
*  It just feels, it's like taking a drug. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4062.28s)]
*  It's like, ah, it's fun. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4064.12s)]
*  But most of those things that people try to acquire, they just look good to other people [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4066.76s)]
*  because they're unattainable. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4072.0s)]
*  Because like you see that big house on the hill, like wow, who lives there? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4074.1200000000003s)]
*  The guy who lives there, that's just his fucking house. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4077.48s)]
*  Once he gets in there and he's watching TV, it's just a fucking house. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4079.88s)]
*  You know, he's eating dinner. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4083.0s)]
*  It's just a house. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4084.0s)]
*  If you don't have good quality of life inside of that, like a wife that you love, children [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4085.0s)]
*  that are happy, if you don't have that, then you have nothing. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4090.1600000000003s)]
*  You have nonsense. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4092.7200000000003s)]
*  I would wake up every day while we were up in the tiny house and I'd walk with the dog. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4094.1s)]
*  I'd just walk up the country roads every day. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4100.62s)]
*  I would walk up the streets with the dog and take a three mile walk and come back and then [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4104.34s)]
*  I'd meditate for like 20 minutes out in front in the woods. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4110.74s)]
*  And then my kid would come out and sit with me. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4115.54s)]
*  It's like, that's the shit you do. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4118.42s)]
*  Like five o'clock, I remember five o'clock, we'd come around and we'd just jump in the [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4121.080000000001s)]
*  truck and go fishing down the street until the sun went down. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4124.360000000001s)]
*  And then we'd come back and we'd grill. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4128.200000000001s)]
*  And then when I'd start a fire, we'd sit by the fire and have the shit scared out of us [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4130.76s)]
*  every five seconds. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4135.320000000001s)]
*  Because you think, well, the thing is when you're in, like at my house in Westchester, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4136.72s)]
*  if you hear something in the woods, it's probably a Jewish guy. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4143.320000000001s)]
*  There's a Jewish temple behind my house. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4147.4800000000005s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4149.360000000001s)]
*  It's a neighbor or something. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4150.38s)]
*  It's maybe a squirrel. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4151.38s)]
*  When you're up there, if you hear something, it's something. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4152.38s)]
*  Like it's not nothing. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4155.62s)]
*  Like you have to, you kind of got to be ready because it could be something. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4156.62s)]
*  It could be a bear. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4162.179999999999s)]
*  It could be a deer. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4163.179999999999s)]
*  It could be a bear. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4164.179999999999s)]
*  It could be fucking anything. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4165.179999999999s)]
*  So it is like no matter how much I want to man up and be like, it's good. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4166.7s)]
*  We're good. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4170.7s)]
*  You know, I have that flash on you like this every five seconds looking for eyes. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4171.7s)]
*  But there's something about that. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4176.82s)]
*  There's something about that fear of exciting. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4178.280000000001s)]
*  Dude, there's something about the woods, man, that scares the shit. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4181.4800000000005s)]
*  I am petrified in the woods. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4185.76s)]
*  I'm petrified. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4188.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm petrified. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4189.88s)]
*  Like when me and Ari went out to the woods and we went camping, I did it with Paul Verzi [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4190.88s)]
*  one. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4194.280000000001s)]
*  That was the funniest thing ever, though. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4195.280000000001s)]
*  I took Paul Verzi up in the woods. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4196.280000000001s)]

*  Yeah, they go with a large pack on their back and they go out deep, deep, deep into the woods. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4510.24s)]
*  They'll spend a week out there hunting by themselves. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4520.24s)]
*  If they get an animal, they pack it out on their back. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4524.24s)]
*  They're bow hunting too. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4527.24s)]
*  There's something about that where it's like, I wish I could go back 10 years and learn how to do that. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4528.24s)]
*  You learn now. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4534.24s)]
*  You're alive now. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4535.24s)]
*  You don't have to go back. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4536.24s)]
*  I hate when people say that. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4538.24s)]
*  I wish I did it when I was younger. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4539.24s)]
*  Yeah, but you didn't. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4541.24s)]
*  You're alive right now and when you're 80, you'll go, I wish I did it when I was 50. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4542.24s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4547.24s)]
*  I'm going to take a hunting course next year when we get up there, me and my son, because he wants to hunt. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4548.24s)]
*  Do they have courses up there? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4555.24s)]
*  Yeah, you can take a course. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4556.24s)]
*  I think it's a three-day course. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4557.24s)]
*  That's great. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4559.24s)]
*  You can jump in. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4560.24s)]
*  We're going to take that. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4561.24s)]
*  Who's the guy that I saw you and Callan go out with? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4562.24s)]
*  Steve Rinella. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4567.24s)]
*  I love his show. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4568.24s)]
*  Oh, he's great. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4569.24s)]
*  I love him. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4570.24s)]
*  I love it. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4571.24s)]
*  I see him just go out there by himself with a backpack and just sleep on the ground. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4572.24s)]
*  No tent, no, not just fucking curl up on the ground. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4580.24s)]
*  The fact that we did that not too long ago, when you think about it, what, 150 years ago, people were doing that, like nothing. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4584.24s)]
*  It was normal. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4595.24s)]
*  It was normal. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4596.24s)]
*  It's normal for Steve. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4597.24s)]
*  Steve Rinella, when we went mule deer hunting a couple years back in Nevada, and he fucking slept on the ground. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4598.24s)]
*  He just lays out a sleeping bag on the ground because it was summer, because it was pretty warm out where we went. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4605.24s)]
*  And just fucking climbed into the sleeping bag, fucking goes to sleep on the ground. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4612.24s)]
*  It's right there. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4617.24s)]
*  No tent, no nothing. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4618.24s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4619.24s)]
*  I love it. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4620.24s)]
*  I'm a big fan of Westerns. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4621.24s)]
*  And they would just pull over, light a fire, have some coffee. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4623.24s)]
*  Just lie down. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4626.24s)]
*  And just lie down. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4627.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4628.24s)]
*  The pillow was there, saddle. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4629.24s)]
*  And the thing is, when that fire goes out and you look up at the stars, like, oh, it's so peaceful. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4630.24s)]
*  It puts it all into perspective. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4637.24s)]
*  I love going to the woods. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4638.24s)]
*  When I go hunting every year, whenever I come back, I tell my wife, like, I need to do this more often. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4640.24s)]
*  And it's not even just about killing an animal and eating it. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4645.24s)]
*  It's really about the reset, like going out there and being alone and being, you know, away from civilization. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4648.24s)]
*  Completely. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4655.24s)]
*  And seeing wild animals and hearing them and stalking them and going up the mountains. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4656.24s)]
*  It's just everything about it is, it requires all of your focus. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4662.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4667.24s)]
*  And it also, it's like a good reset for my mind. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4668.24s)]
*  It makes me miss my family. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4671.24s)]
*  It makes me miss my friends. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4673.24s)]
*  It makes me very appreciative of things. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4674.24s)]
*  And it just puts it all into perspective. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4676.24s)]
*  It just, there's no cell phone service up there. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4679.24s)]
*  So you're not checking your social media. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4681.24s)]
*  You're not doing shit. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4683.24s)]
*  All you're doing is just up there being one with nature. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4684.24s)]
*  Being a part of nature. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4690.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4691.24s)]
*  It's, and to know, you have to know about the things you're in. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4692.24s)]
*  You have to know about nature. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4698.24s)]
*  You have to know about trees. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4699.24s)]
*  You have to know about plants. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4700.24s)]
*  You have to know about the animals. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4701.24s)]
*  And it's a long learning curve. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4703.24s)]
*  You know, when I first went hunting with Renella was 2012. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4705.24s)]
*  So it was 10 years ago, that video with me and Callan. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4708.24s)]
*  And I didn't know jack shit. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4712.24s)]
*  I mean, I'd been fishing a few times, but what had happened was I had seen a bunch of PETA videos. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4714.24s)]
*  And I was like, OK, I'm either going to become a vegetarian or I'm going to become a hunter. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4720.24s)]
*  Because I don't want to be a part of this factory farming thing. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4725.24s)]
*  It's just horrific. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4728.24s)]
*  And so we went and I shot that deer right there. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4729.24s)]
*  That skull that's on the table. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4733.24s)]
*  That's the reason why it's there. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4735.24s)]
*  That was the first animal that I killed and ate. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4737.24s)]
*  I ate it all in like three months. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4739.24s)]
*  And I was like, I can't wait to go back. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4741.24s)]
*  That's what I want to do now. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4743.24s)]
*  I just want to eat wild animals. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4744.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4746.24s)]
*  And just go out there and get my own food and just the reset alone. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4747.24s)]
*  And Callan and I had the best time because he got two comics and a bunch of these like hard nosed fucking, you know, like hard camping hunters. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4750.24s)]
*  And Callan's taken a shit and we put like a silver flag in it. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4761.24s)]
*  We put a flag in his shit. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4765.24s)]
*  And I took a picture of him and he's like sitting there squatting. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4767.24s)]
*  We had a fucking blast. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4769.24s)]
*  We were just crying laughing. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4771.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4774.24s)]
*  Because Callan, if like he has a captive audience, he's one of the funniest motherfuckers alive. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4775.24s)]
*  And he was he had this character that he did called the ravine comer. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4780.24s)]
*  So he would go to a ravine and pretend like he's coming in the ravine. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4785.24s)]
*  And like I'm not doing justice. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4792.24s)]
*  We were fucking tears. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4795.24s)]
*  We were butchering a deer while Callan pretended to jack off into a ravine. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4797.24s)]
*  He's pulling his pants down. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4803.24s)]
*  We're always seeing his butt. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4805.24s)]
*  And he's like pretending to jack off into this ravine. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4806.24s)]
*  He created this character. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4809.24s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4810.24s)]
*  It was so fun. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4811.24s)]
*  Even in that show, he was fucking killing it. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4812.24s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4814.24s)]
*  And so much of it we left out. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4815.24s)]
*  We have to leave out the ravine comer. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4816.24s)]
*  The ravine comer never. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4818.24s)]
*  That's not the name of the episode. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4819.24s)]
*  It never made the cut. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4821.24s)]
*  We had so much fun. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4823.24s)]
*  But it was also it was beautiful. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4824.24s)]
*  I remember we were eating over a fire. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4826.24s)]
*  We were there's I think one scene actually did make it in because when I went to shoot that deer, I had to crawl to a position and lay the rifle down on a rock to get a good spot. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4830.24s)]
*  And I crawled right over a cactus. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4843.24s)]
*  So I had cactus thorns all over my legs. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4845.24s)]
*  So I had my pants down by the fire. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4849.24s)]
*  I think that's a video of it online of Callan with needle nose pliers pulling pulling cactus thorns out of my ass and legs while we're eating this meat over a fire. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4852.24s)]
*  That's a friend. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4866.24s)]
*  Oh, that's a friend. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4867.24s)]
*  But when we were there eating that meat over the fire, it was so satisfying. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4868.24s)]
*  And the meat was so good because it was so fresh and was like, you know, we just put salt on it like maybe salt and a little pepper. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4876.24s)]
*  And we're just frying, you know, but we're grilling it over this fire. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4882.24s)]
*  And I remember thinking, I want to do this for the rest of my life. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4886.24s)]
*  Yeah, like this is the most fun. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4889.24s)]
*  The most the food was so delicious and it was so satisfying. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4891.24s)]
*  And if you've never had wild game before, like people have this idea like gamey taste badly. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4895.24s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4900.24s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4901.24s)]
*  That's just the only time wild meat is gamey is when people prepare it wrong, when they let it go bad or that it gets dirty or the glands of the animal. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4902.24s)]
*  And when they're in when they're in the rut, when they're mating, they have a tarsal gland that's a gland on their leg. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4911.24s)]
*  And if you puncture that gland and that the scent gets on the meat tastes like shit. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4917.24s)]
*  But that's just a lack of proper preparation. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4922.24s)]
*  You just have to be careful and treat it with respect. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4925.24s)]
*  And I think you should. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4927.24s)]
*  It is delicious. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4928.24s)]
*  You should. I feel like everybody should know how to hunt because if stuff does go south. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4929.24s)]
*  I remember in New York with the blackout. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4936.24s)]
*  I don't know if you remember that back in wherever the fuck it was. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4939.24s)]
*  I remember it turned so wild when that sun went down. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4942.24s)]
*  There was no lights quick. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4950.24s)]
*  A day. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4952.24s)]
*  I told my wife, I go, I go, there's no electricity. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4953.24s)]
*  All the delis were given out their ice cream. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4956.24s)]
*  It was all every day. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4959.24s)]
*  You know, and everybody was having a good time. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4960.24s)]
*  I go, where are you? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4961.24s)]
*  She goes, I'm down having margaritas and so I'm going to get your ass on the highway and walk home right now. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4962.24s)]
*  Wow. There was people, regular people directing traffic because people were almost getting killed because there was no streetlights. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4969.24s)]
*  People trying to get out of the city. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4975.24s)]
*  So, you know, there's not enough cops. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4977.24s)]
*  I go walk up the West Side Highway, get home. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4979.24s)]
*  The big high rises. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4981.24s)]
*  People, there was no lights. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4982.24s)]
*  You couldn't like people that walk in these dark hallways. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4984.24s)]
*  Forty flights. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4987.24s)]
*  No elevators. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4989.24s)]
*  So people were like staying on the bottom floor with flashlights to help people up to their apartments. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4991.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4998.24s)]
*  And I remember we took a walk one block. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=4999.24s)]
*  We were forty forty third between 10th and 11th. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5001.24s)]
*  We walked up to ninth and we turned around because it was chaos. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5003.24s)]
*  You know who didn't give a fuck? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5007.24s)]
*  Who? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5009.24s)]
*  Homeless people. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5010.24s)]
*  Look at that. Is that what it was like? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5011.24s)]
*  Yeah. Look at that. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5012.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5013.24s)]
*  That's one day, a few hours without electricity in Manhattan. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5014.24s)]
*  And it turned. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5017.24s)]
*  It turned. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5019.24s)]
*  It turned crazy. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5020.24s)]
*  What about the people that were stuck on the trains? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5021.24s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5022.24s)]
*  They had to walk out through the subway. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5023.24s)]
*  Walk out through those tunnels with all those fucking rats. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5025.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5027.24s)]
*  They had to walk out through the. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5028.24s)]
*  And there's actually buildings in New York. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5029.24s)]
*  I don't know if you know this. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5032.24s)]
*  There's there's townhouses. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5033.24s)]
*  They look like townhouses, but they're empty. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5034.24s)]
*  They're actually subway escape routes. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5036.24s)]
*  The vents for the subway. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5038.24s)]
*  It looks like a brownstone, but inside is a vent for the subway. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5040.24s)]
*  And if people get stuck in the subway, they actually come out through that brownstone. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5044.24s)]
*  Look at all those people walking out through the subways. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5049.24s)]
*  Airport. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5051.24s)]
*  How long did the blackout last? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5052.24s)]
*  One night. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5054.24s)]
*  That's it? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5055.24s)]
*  We walked up to ninth ave. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5056.24s)]
*  There was barrels on fire. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5057.24s)]
*  A homeless guy came up and we were with a friend of ours, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5059.24s)]
*  grabbed the girl's ass, like stuck his hand in her, her twat. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5063.24s)]
*  It was like, oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5067.24s)]
*  And we turned around and went back to the house and just sat in the house. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5070.24s)]
*  I stayed up all night. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5073.24s)]
*  Wow. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5075.24s)]
*  I mean, that's one night. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5076.24s)]
*  That's one night. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5077.24s)]
*  And the city went chaos. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5078.24s)]
*  Look at all those people walking on the bridge. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5080.24s)]
*  Holy fucking shit. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5082.24s)]
*  Holy fucking shit. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5084.24s)]
*  Look at all those people on that bridge. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5086.24s)]
*  Is that crazy? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5088.24s)]
*  It's scary. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5089.24s)]
*  Why? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5090.24s)]
*  That frightens me. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5091.24s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5092.24s)]
*  Well, that's a zombie movie, right? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5093.24s)]
*  That's how it goes down. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5094.24s)]
*  Look at that cool motherfucker with his ax blown up. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5095.24s)]
*  That dude probably got all the pussy. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5097.24s)]
*  He got all that pandemic pussy. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5099.24s)]
*  Look at, I mean, it's, I mean, that means shit right now. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5102.24s)]
*  It's shit. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5105.24s)]
*  The sun went down. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5107.24s)]
*  New York City was just like being in New Hampshire. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5109.24s)]
*  We had a power outage out here a couple, was it a year and a half ago, Jamie? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5111.24s)]
*  Yeah, February. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5115.24s)]
*  February 21. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5117.24s)]
*  And it was weird. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5119.24s)]
*  It was weird because it snowed. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5121.24s)]
*  And so no one out here knows how to drive in the snow at all. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5123.24s)]
*  And then the roads iced over because they don't have plows. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5126.24s)]
*  So it was like freezing rain and then, you know, worst conditions ever. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5129.24s)]
*  Freezing rain first, then snow. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5134.24s)]
*  So you have a layer of ice over the roads and then you have snow on top of that. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5136.24s)]
*  And just people sliding off, crashing into each other. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5141.24s)]
*  No one knew what the fuck to do. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5144.24s)]
*  They all have SUVs, four wheel drive. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5146.24s)]
*  They don't know how to use it. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5147.24s)]
*  Well, they have SUVs with street tires on them. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5148.24s)]
*  They have like a Cayenne. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5150.24s)]
*  You know, Porsche Cayenne with those fat, it's like fucking sports car tires. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5152.24s)]
*  They're terrible. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5155.24s)]
*  I have a 1995 Land Cruiser that I had built for the apocalypse. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5156.24s)]
*  I'm coming to your house. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5160.24s)]
*  I have tons of meat, literally. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5162.24s)]
*  I have commercial freezers filled with meat. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5165.24s)]
*  I have three commercial freezers here filled with meat. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5168.24s)]
*  I'm not fucking around. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5170.24s)]
*  I fuck it. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5171.24s)]
*  No, I keep wild meat. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5172.24s)]
*  I give a lot of it to my friends and I cook a lot of it. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5173.24s)]
*  But when the shit goes down, the real problem is not meat. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5177.24s)]
*  It's bullets. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5181.24s)]
*  Like how many bullets do you have? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5182.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5184.24s)]
*  Like if you have a box of bullets, what's that? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5185.24s)]
*  A hundred bullets? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5187.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5188.24s)]
*  You know how quick a hundred bullets goes when you're hunting? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5189.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5191.24s)]
*  You're trying to find meat? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5192.24s)]
*  Like how good a shot are you? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5193.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5194.24s)]
*  Like do you know about the wind? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5195.24s)]
*  Do you know about like keeping away from like, you have to have scent. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5196.24s)]
*  Like you have to have a scent, a wind catcher. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5200.24s)]
*  Like so, or a wind detector. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5203.24s)]
*  So what it is is like talcum powder and you have a little bottle. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5206.24s)]
*  Like when you hunt, you squeeze this bottle in the air and a mist of smoke like talcum powder goes in the air and then it drifts which way the wind goes. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5209.24s)]
*  It's a wind detector. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5218.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5219.24s)]
*  So you know you have to be on the right side of the wind. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5220.24s)]
*  If you are above the deer and the wind is blowing down towards them, they're going to run away from hundreds of yards away. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5222.24s)]
*  So you have to plan the wind correctly. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5229.24s)]
*  So as you walk in and you got to, like it's not easy. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5231.24s)]
*  Like the idea that, oh yeah, oh, I got to go and I'll be fine. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5234.24s)]
*  You're not going to be fine. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5237.24s)]
*  First of all, the animals are going to figure out real quick that they're being hunted. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5238.24s)]
*  So they're going to disappear and they're going to go nocturnal and you're not going to find them. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5242.24s)]
*  Plus people don't know that, you know, you think that if something goes down, you just go kill a deer. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5245.24s)]
*  It's like, no, you get to kill a squirrel, kill a small animal and eat that unless you know how to gut that deer and get that meat prepared. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5249.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5260.24s)]
*  And if it's hot out, the deer is good for one day. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5261.24s)]
*  One day. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5263.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5264.24s)]
*  So you got to know how to smoke it or whatever you do to it to keep it. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5265.24s)]
*  It's, you know, you're going to have to jerk it. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5267.24s)]
*  You're going to have to like take it off. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5269.24s)]
*  You have to jerk it off. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5270.24s)]
*  You have to jerk off the deer. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5271.24s)]
*  Take it. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5272.24s)]
*  You got to make it slice it into thin pieces and you're going to have to dry it out. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5273.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5276.24s)]
*  And even then it's not going to last forever. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5277.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5278.24s)]
*  You have to salt it. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5279.24s)]
*  We're fucked. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5280.24s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff you have to do. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5281.24s)]
*  We're fucked. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5282.24s)]
*  We're fucked. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5283.24s)]
*  Not all of us. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5284.24s)]
*  You're not fucked. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5285.24s)]
*  I'm still kind of fucked because then the real problem is not animals and food. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5286.24s)]
*  The real problem is people that don't have animals or food. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5288.24s)]
*  That's the real problem is that the other people that are around you. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5291.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5295.24s)]
*  Like if you're in a highly populated area and it runs out of food, it doesn't matter [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5296.24s)]
*  what you have. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5299.84s)]
*  Like your main problem now is other people that are desperate. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5300.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5304.24s)]
*  And you can only give them so much. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5305.24s)]
*  Like you can't give them everything you have. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5306.24s)]
*  So even if you want to help out, the only way you got to have a community and then everyone [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5307.719999999999s)]
*  in the community has to chip in and you have to know that you can count on each other so [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5312.099999999999s)]
*  you become an asset to each other and not like a competitor. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5315.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5318.719999999999s)]
*  It's like the walking dead shit. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5319.719999999999s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5321.92s)]
*  The zombies weren't the problem. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5322.92s)]
*  The problem was other people. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5323.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5324.92s)]
*  And that's fucking real. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5325.92s)]
*  Like in Manhattan, if Manhattan gets hit with a nuke and then the power goes out and then [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5326.92s)]
*  all the people in Westchester and all the people in Connecticut are the only ones that [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5333.36s)]
*  survive. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5336.64s)]
*  I saw that episode with, what's her name? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5337.64s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5342.48s)]
*  Tulsi, I love her by the way. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5343.48s)]
*  She scares the fuck out of me with that. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5344.48s)]
*  That commercial? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5345.48s)]
*  Well, they're talking about Russia. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5346.879999999999s)]
*  Like that sort of explanation of how quickly things can go badly and how we're contributing [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5348.36s)]
*  to that by funneling money and funneling arms over to Ukraine. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5353.799999999999s)]
*  As much as you think of what Russia has done as horrific, we're on the verge of nuclear [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5358.799999999999s)]
*  war right now. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5365.339999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that are profiting off of that. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5367.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's a whole industry of arms manufacturers who are accelerating that. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5370.36s)]
*  That would suck if my special becomes a hit and then the fucking bomb hits. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5376.6s)]
*  No Americans can even travel over to Russia. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5380.5199999999995s)]
*  It's fucking dangerous. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5382.72s)]
*  Brittany Greiner is over there rotting in a fucking cell. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5383.96s)]
*  They gave her nine years for having a marijuana vape pen on her. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5388.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, like in America, we have Russian fighters that fight in the UFC all the time. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5392.16s)]
*  They're 100% safe. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5396.64s)]
*  They come over here, they fight. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5398.36s)]
*  Pyotr Yon from Russia is fighting for the title. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5399.64s)]
*  He's fighting this weekend. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5402.32s)]
*  We have plenty of Russians come over here. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5404.64s)]
*  They get treated fine. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5405.96s)]
*  But if you're an American, you go over to Russia, you're fucked. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5407.400000000001s)]
*  Not good. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5411.08s)]
*  It sucks because we were kind of cool with them for a minute. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5412.08s)]
*  Yes, forever. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5414.84s)]
*  Right? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5415.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5416.84s)]
*  Dude, Roy Jones Jr. became a fucking Russian citizen. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5417.84s)]
*  He did. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5420.4400000000005s)]
*  How? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5421.4400000000005s)]
*  He's friends with Putin because they love him for his boxing. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5422.4400000000005s)]
*  He had some fights over there and would go over there and so they gave him a Russian citizenship. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5425.0s)]
*  He got a Russian passport. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5429.8s)]
*  Yeah, we were cool with them for a while. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5431.320000000001s)]

*  He goes, oh, that was me. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5849.98s)]
*  It was him pretending to be the FBI. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5852.5s)]
*  He goes, dude, I couldn't take it anymore. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5854.94s)]
*  I was spending like two nights in a row all night trying to write. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5857.179999999999s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5861.42s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5862.42s)]
*  I just created social media. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5864.54s)]
*  It was the hottest thing in the world. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5869.06s)]
*  And he couldn't handle it. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5871.18s)]
*  So he killed the whole thing. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5872.18s)]
*  He killed it. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5873.18s)]
*  It's like when a kid's losing in a video game and he unplugs the box. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5874.18s)]
*  Dude, he unplugged the box, Joe. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5876.580000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5878.580000000001s)]
*  Dude, it was nuts. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5879.580000000001s)]
*  And he didn't even tell anybody. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5880.580000000001s)]
*  Dude, didn't tell me. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5881.580000000001s)]

*  That's kind of nefarious. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5886.26s)]
*  That he pretended to be the FBI. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5887.26s)]
*  Dude, it was not. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5889.26s)]
*  I mean, dude, child services. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5890.26s)]
*  It had a logo, a phone number. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5891.26s)]
*  I remember calling the number going, can I please talk to somebody? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5893.5s)]
*  Like there was a number. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5897.22s)]
*  What happens when you call the number? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5898.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5899.38s)]
*  Left a voicemail. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5900.38s)]
*  What's this bullshit? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5901.38s)]
*  Wow. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5902.38s)]
*  But that was like the first, I mean, I got petrified that I was going to get sued. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5903.38s)]
*  What a crazy way to handle the situation. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5907.1s)]
*  Instead of just getting out and not reading it, he decides to kill the whole thing. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5909.740000000001s)]
*  He's killed. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5914.34s)]
*  I was like, why did you tell me? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5915.34s)]
*  That's so strange. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5916.34s)]
*  It would have been hilarious. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5917.34s)]
*  It was after I douched it. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5918.34s)]
*  He was like, dude, that was me, you fucking idiot. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5920.22s)]
*  But a year later, he tells you? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5922.22s)]
*  Yeah, weird. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5924.42s)]
*  Weird. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5925.42s)]
*  That's so weird. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5926.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5927.62s)]
*  That's very bizarre behavior. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5928.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5929.62s)]
*  I remember we used to have websites. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5930.62s)]
*  I had crazy websites when they were, remember websites were a thing. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5932.62s)]
*  I had a website, I want to put it back up just for like a couple of months. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5936.18s)]
*  I walked out, me. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5941.22s)]
*  I walked out on the top. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5943.58s)]
*  Like me as a person walked out and I grabbed the mic and I went, and it just went, and [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5945.9400000000005s)]
*  all the balls sprinkled around. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5953.22s)]
*  And then there was a ball in the middle that was my face. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5955.14s)]
*  But when you touched it, it was liquid. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5957.3s)]
*  Really? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5959.38s)]
*  Dude, I had the best fucking websites. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5960.38s)]
*  Who designed it for you? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5962.3s)]
*  I have this guy, Kurt Iverson. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5963.3s)]
*  He's just this genius dude from, he was from Kansas City and he did my websites, but he [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5965.66s)]
*  was just a genius. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5972.900000000001s)]
*  He would go out and just, I would say, this is what I want. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5974.54s)]
*  And then he would just create it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5977.5s)]
*  Where do you think this goes? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5978.96s)]
*  Like we're looking back on the nineties on websites like, wow, remember that? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5980.860000000001s)]
*  Now everyone is just deeply involved in social media and very few people put any time into [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5985.78s)]
*  their website now. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5989.78s)]
*  Where do you think this goes? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5991.5s)]
*  Do you think it goes to like augmented reality or virtual reality? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5992.5s)]
*  I think VR. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5995.5s)]
*  You think like the metaverse, that kind of shit? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5996.5s)]
*  Have you used the VR yet, the Quest? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=5998.78s)]
*  Yeah, I have. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6000.3s)]
*  When Zuckerberg was here, he showed me the new version of meta, which is out now. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6001.34s)]
*  It's the new version of Oculus. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6006.2s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6008.54s)]
*  One of the more interesting things was that you could tour places. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6009.54s)]
*  Like you can go to the Louvre in Paris and you're walking around. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6012.7s)]
*  And so like you could just like go to there and then it's like there's people around you [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6016.74s)]
*  moving around because they filmed it while there was a crowd there. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6020.44s)]
*  So it doesn't feel exactly like you're there, but it's pretty fucking close. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6024.22s)]
*  You can go to a comedy show. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6029.38s)]
*  I went to a comedy show. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6031.179999999999s)]
*  I sat in the front row and I turned around and there was people next to me and the comic [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6032.38s)]
*  looked at me and went like this. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6036.66s)]
*  I was like, what's up? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6038.099999999999s)]
*  And I saw a comedy show on Quest, on Oculus. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6040.16s)]
*  And I mean, it was crazy. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6044.639999999999s)]
*  So that's going to happen. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6046.12s)]
*  You could put a camera here and people could sit in on this podcast with us. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6047.48s)]
*  Well they're doing virtual reality UFCs. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6052.88s)]
*  They're going to do that. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6056.2s)]
*  Or you're going to be like inside the fucking octagon, which is crazy. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6057.9s)]
*  Like you're going to be like right there watching. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6062.28s)]
*  You could probably sit wherever you want. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6064.82s)]
*  I bet you could probably sit in the crowd or you could probably be watching from the [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6066.639999999999s)]
*  octagon itself. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6069.839999999999s)]
*  I love it. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6071.32s)]
*  I love technology. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6072.32s)]
*  I'm a big fan. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6073.32s)]
*  I love gadgets. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6074.5599999999995s)]
*  I love new shit and I love that you can do that. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6075.639999999999s)]
*  Number one, it's too big. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6081.44s)]
*  They got to make it smaller. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6083.44s)]
*  They got to make it because you put that on, you can only have it on for a certain amount [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6084.96s)]
*  of time. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6087.719999999999s)]
*  Number two, it's got to be cheaper. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6088.92s)]
*  I mean the new Oculus that Facebook is doing is $1,700. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6091.84s)]
*  It's like dude, you got to make that $200 somehow and smaller so that the average do. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6098.8s)]
*  But it's scary to me because during the pandemic, I was going to movies with friends. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6105.400000000001s)]
*  We'd all put our Oculus on and we'd meet at the movie theater. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6111.4800000000005s)]
*  Really? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6115.68s)]
*  Dude. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6116.68s)]
*  What movies? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6117.68s)]
*  We watched Caddy Shack one night. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6118.68s)]
*  My friend plugged it into his computer and we went in and we sat down in the movie theater, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6120.36s)]
*  all of us, eight of us in the movie theater watching Caddy Shack and it was my little [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6126.679999999999s)]
*  avatar that I made and I was looking over. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6130.92s)]
*  We're throwing popcorn at each other. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6133.24s)]
*  We're getting drinks, throwing stuff. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6135.32s)]
*  I remember it got really fucked up for me because other people could come in too because [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6137.5199999999995s)]
*  it's open to the universe. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6142.679999999999s)]
*  I remember a chick sat next to me. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6145.08s)]
*  This chick with a mohawk sat next to me and she was like, hi. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6148.28s)]
*  I was like, hey. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6152.28s)]
*  We waved. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6153.64s)]
*  I felt like I was cheating. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6155.36s)]
*  That was probably a dude. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6157.96s)]
*  100% it was some fucking dude from Minneapolis. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6160.44s)]
*  Weird fan. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6164.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6165.92s)]
*  But I still had that emotion. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6166.92s)]
*  Right, like it's a real person. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6168.92s)]
*  A hot chick sat next to me at the movie theater. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6170.44s)]
*  Now wait until it gets to the point where that person could touch you and you feel it. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6172.44s)]
*  Is this the movie screen? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6176.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6178.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6179.44s)]
*  You can pick what theater you want. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6180.44s)]
*  So you walk in, you sit down and you watch the movie just like you're in a movie theater. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6181.44s)]
*  Just like you're in a theater. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6185.679999999999s)]
*  Are you talking to each other? [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6186.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can talk. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6188.08s)]
*  You can't verbally, I can't forget. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6189.799999999999s)]
*  I remember you could write stuff and it would come up or something in the chat or something [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6192.44s)]
*  like that but yeah, dude, we were in the theater. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6196.12s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6198.639999999999s)]
*  This is incredible. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6199.639999999999s)]
*  Experience 3D movies together. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6200.639999999999s)]
*  You can put your favorite PC games together. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6201.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6203.84s)]
*  Can you do first person shooters, Jamie? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6204.84s)]
*  You can but they're not good yet. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6206.72s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6209.160000000001s)]
*  They're not good? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6210.160000000001s)]
*  No, they're not good yet because we're used to playing Call of Duty and all that stuff. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6211.160000000001s)]
*  They don't have that? [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6216.96s)]
*  They have it but it's a version of it and it's not good yet. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6218.0s)]
*  There was a time where they were talking about doing these multi-directional treadmills. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6221.96s)]
*  Have you ever seen those things where you wear like that? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6228.96s)]
*  Am I having a stroke or did a star just shoot across the center? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6230.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6233.24s)]
*  I was like shit. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6234.24s)]
*  I'm going to stroke on it. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6235.24s)]
*  Yeah, everybody freaks out about that. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6236.24s)]
*  I should probably tell people. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6237.639999999999s)]
*  It's the last game they have for it. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6239.2s)]
*  What is this one? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6241.16s)]
*  So you move with your feet by moving your hands like that? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6242.16s)]
*  Yeah, they go like locomotion or something. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6244.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, that looks stupid. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6245.919999999999s)]
*  No, but they do have foot things now. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6246.919999999999s)]
*  They do have a thing that you put on your shoes and you just walk. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6248.799999999999s)]
*  So they do have it. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6253.08s)]
*  Not everybody has it. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6254.719999999999s)]
*  So they are getting close to where you'll put the gloves on. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6255.719999999999s)]
*  So now when you go to Oculus, remember how to use those little thumb things? [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6259.2s)]
*  Now it scans your hands and you don't have to use those things. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6263.12s)]
*  You can just use your hands. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6267.12s)]
*  Your hand, it's nuts to me. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6268.84s)]
*  Your hand comes up in front of your face and it's your hand. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6271.599999999999s)]
*  Are you holding anything in your hand? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6274.68s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6277.08s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6278.08s)]
*  He didn't describe this to us, but I read it in their article. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6279.08s)]
*  They asked Zuckerberg, what else do you have that's cool when it's coming? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6281.0s)]
*  And he said EKG might be what it's called. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6284.96s)]
*  They have sensors for the wrist. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6287.88s)]
*  It looks probably like this strap from my whoop strap. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6289.08s)]
*  And it's reading the way your wrist moves. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6291.76s)]
*  So the way they have it working right now is you put on the sunglasses and you can do [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6294.56s)]
*  a little typing motion. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6298.240000000001s)]
*  But they have it so that you can play video games with it and move your hand like a joystick. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6300.52s)]
*  But he said they have it developed to the point in testing right now where you don't [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6305.84s)]
*  even really have to move your fingers. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6310.240000000001s)]
*  You can just sort of think about it and it'll start doing it for you. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6311.4400000000005s)]
*  You can play a whole game without even moving. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6314.96s)]
*  So you'll attach something to your feet and then something to your hands. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6316.68s)]
*  And then you'll be able to like take your gun and explode it and then change parts, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6321.200000000001s)]
*  make it into a different gun and then bring it back and fucking start shooting people. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6327.160000000001s)]
*  What I had seen was there was a thing where you were in a small circular treadmill, but [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6334.68s)]
*  you're attached at the waist. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6341.360000000001s)]
*  So the treadmill moves in any direction and you move it with your feet. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6344.08s)]
*  You know those treadmills where they're self-propelled? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6351.12s)]
*  It's not working on a machine. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6354.64s)]
*  It's like your foot is making the wheel spin. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6355.96s)]
*  Well, it's that, but it's circular. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6358.48s)]
*  So you move in any direction and you're carrying like a plastic gun. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6360.5599999999995s)]
*  And then you have the virtual reality headset and you're running around like you're in a [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6364.72s)]
*  real first person shooter, but you're stationary. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6367.8s)]
*  But it's like you're strapped. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6371.08s)]
*  Is that, have they made, is that like a concept? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6372.96s)]
*  It's not, but I don't believe that anyone's got it to the point where it's like good. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6378.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6382.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good yet. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6383.68s)]
*  That would be perfect. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6384.68s)]
*  Like that kind of setup, if you had that kind of setup where you have a small treadmill [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6385.92s)]
*  and there was like a railing around it. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6390.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6392.68s)]
*  Here's a video of five different versions of it. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6393.68s)]
*  Like there's one where you can sit down. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6394.68s)]
*  Oh, that's ridiculous. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6396.28s)]
*  That's the foot thing. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6398.04s)]
*  So you're just moving your feet around as you're sitting. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6399.88s)]
*  So that's the one I'm talking about. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6402.16s)]
*  That's the one. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6404.16s)]
*  So it's like this circular thing. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6405.16s)]
*  So you can kind of go and it's called the virtualizer. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6407.16s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6410.12s)]
*  And so you go in virtualizer elite two. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6411.14s)]
*  And so you move around. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6415.44s)]
*  And so as you're moving, you're actually getting a workout, which is pretty fucking cool too. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6417.24s)]
*  Because like, you know, dance, dance revolution. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6421.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6423.56s)]
*  Fucking kids lost shit loads of weight and got in great shape because they got addicted [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6424.56s)]
*  to that game. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6428.76s)]
*  And so it's like rewarding because the game is fun, but you're actually getting a benefit [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6430.04s)]
*  out of it. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6433.6s)]
*  So if you have this, this virtualizer, a different one. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6434.7s)]
*  So this one is different, but it's the same kind of deal. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6439.8s)]
*  Like you're actually using your legs to move around. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6443.04s)]
*  And when you're doing this, you have a haptic feedback suit on. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6446.26s)]
*  So if you get shot, you feel it. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6449.4400000000005s)]
*  And look at that guy's running. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6451.04s)]
*  He's actually running. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6452.84s)]
*  So you're getting a good fucking workout. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6454.08s)]
*  The problem is, is that most guys who game are like, you know, 400 pounds. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6455.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6459.52s)]
*  But you can lose weight like this. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6460.52s)]
*  The same thing with the dance, dance revolution thing. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6461.96s)]
*  Like, a lot of people started out fat, but you know, in dance, dance revolution, you [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6464.360000000001s)]
*  have to move your feet really fast to get a good score. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6468.08s)]
*  And so if you're doing this and the faster you run, the faster you actually move in the [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6470.92s)]
*  game, that's fucking amazing. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6475.6s)]
*  They have boxing on it, which is a dude. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6476.92s)]
*  If you do that, it kills you. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6479.8s)]
*  Oh, it does. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6481.400000000001s)]
*  Workout videos too. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6482.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6483.56s)]
*  You can go on the workout, you can go on the Oculus. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6484.72s)]
*  The only thing is, is that thing is just so heavy on you. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6485.92s)]
*  It's less heavy. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6489.360000000001s)]
*  The new one's less heavy. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6490.360000000001s)]
*  Once they make it smaller where it's less heavy, you'll be able to go to the gym and [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6491.360000000001s)]
*  work out with a trainer in your living room. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6495.120000000001s)]
*  Virtually. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6498.320000000001s)]
*  Virtually. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6499.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, did you try the porn? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6500.320000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6501.320000000001s)]
*  Listen to me, man. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6502.320000000001s)]
*  I'm listening. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6503.88s)]
*  I will never go back to it because it's too. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6505.320000000001s)]
*  Too much. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6508.92s)]
*  I was at the Comedy Connection in Rhode Island and they had the thing. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6510.4800000000005s)]
*  He goes, put this on. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6513.2s)]
*  And it was a porn. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6515.8s)]
*  And I'm sitting there, it's after the show, I'm at the bar, all the waitresses and bartenders [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6517.8s)]
*  and the other comics are over there. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6521.48s)]
*  I'm sitting in a chair and I put this on and this girl comes up. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6522.679999999999s)]
*  She's like, hey baby. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6527.96s)]
*  But she's right there looking in my eyes. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6529.4s)]
*  And I'm looking around at her kitchen. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6533.32s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you look down and you get these muscle legs. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6538.84s)]
*  You look fantastic. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6543.16s)]
*  And then she starts talking to you. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6544.96s)]
*  And she started doing stuff to me and I started moving. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6546.24s)]
*  You started humping. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6551.96s)]
*  Air humping. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6554.0s)]
*  I was like, get these off me. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6555.0s)]
*  I was literally just like, it's crazy. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6556.4800000000005s)]
*  And what's going to happen is the next level is going to be some sort of a neural interface [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6560.2s)]
*  where you're going to feel touch. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6566.6s)]
*  It's going to be whether it's 10 years from now or 20 years from now. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6569.160000000001s)]
*  That's coming. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6572.200000000001s)]
*  What you're going to do next, I think, with these things is you can customize it. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6573.200000000001s)]
*  You can customize it. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6578.52s)]
*  So if there's a porn star you like, like I'm friends with Bailey J. You know Bailey J.? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6579.52s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6585.0s)]
*  She's trans. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6586.64s)]
*  Trans, yeah. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6587.64s)]
*  Her husband, Matt, is a good friend of mine. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6588.64s)]
*  I love them both. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6590.92s)]
*  But you'll be able to, like he was talking to me about it. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6592.4400000000005s)]
*  He goes, the next stage in porn is virtual where you could hire Bailey or any porn star [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6595.76s)]
*  you want and they'll do, you'll go and do the porn. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6603.360000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6608.84s)]
*  But it's yours and it's virtual. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6609.84s)]
*  So you keep it. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6611.8s)]
*  So you can go back. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6612.8s)]
*  So you go actually have sex with her. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6614.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6616.08s)]
*  And film it. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6617.08s)]
*  Film it. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6618.08s)]
*  Oh, you know what I mean? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6619.08s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6620.08s)]
*  And you'll have that porn forever where you can just put it on and have sex with whatever [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6621.08s)]
*  porn star you want virtually in your living room. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6625.72s)]
*  You can relive that moment over and over again. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6628.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6631.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, virtual porn is nuts because you can see the person that you're there. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6632.4400000000005s)]
*  They're looking in your eyes. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6637.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6639.08s)]
*  Like if you watch regular porn, you're just a fly on the wall observing it, you know? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6640.08s)]
*  But when they look, when a smoking hot chick is looking at you and going, baby, baby, what [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6644.280000000001s)]
*  do you want me to do? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6651.56s)]
*  You start talking back. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6652.56s)]
*  You go, I want you to. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6654.42s)]
*  And it's like, oh. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6656.22s)]
*  He took it off immediately. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6657.22s)]
*  I took it off immediately, dude. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6658.7s)]
*  I won't go back because it's the Matrix. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6660.22s)]
*  It's the Matrix. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6662.82s)]
*  I mean, the Matrix, it's funny because that movie came out. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6663.82s)]
*  We're like, oh, this is fun because it'll never happen. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6666.66s)]
*  We're there. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6670.06s)]
*  We're pretty close. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6672.06s)]
*  We're like at the door. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6673.06s)]
*  We're reaching for the door knob to the Matrix. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6675.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6677.62s)]
*  We're ready to open up the door and step into it. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6678.62s)]
*  Some people are probably further ahead than others. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6680.9400000000005s)]
*  And then again, these neural interfaces like Neuralink, when things like that, when they [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6683.54s)]
*  start doing that and they can send signals directly to your brain, whoa. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6689.1s)]
*  I was thinking of this and I decided to Google before I asked you, have you heard of AI porn [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6692.18s)]
*  yet because I imagine using all this AI technology we're seeing online right now, they have to [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6696.94s)]
*  have been working on this. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6701.82s)]
*  And it turns out they are. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6703.0199999999995s)]
*  Of course. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6704.0199999999995s)]
*  And this is what comes up on Google. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6705.0199999999995s)]
*  They look pretty good. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6706.62s)]
*  The thing about it is like you could say this is like non-exploitation porn too, right? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6707.62s)]
*  Because it's not an actual human that got raised by shitty parents. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6712.76s)]
*  It's like you don't have to feel bad because the problem with porn is when some girls are [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6716.320000000001s)]
*  like when she's gagging and her fucking mascara is running, you're like, what happened to [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6721.56s)]
*  you? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6727.56s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6728.56s)]
*  The problem is like you want to think she's just a free spirit and she's like very healthy [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6729.56s)]
*  and she just enjoys sex and she gets off on it. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6733.54s)]
*  The reality of that sort of like public display of sexuality is oftentimes it stems from abuse. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6736.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6745.38s)]
*  Unfortunate. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6746.38s)]
*  I mean this is, yeah, this is crazy. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6747.38s)]
*  I mean they have it. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6748.740000000001s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6749.740000000001s)]
*  They have it. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6750.740000000001s)]
*  If you Google porn now, if you're doing a little porn, they always have this type of [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6751.740000000001s)]
*  stuff. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6753.26s)]
*  It fucking aggravates me because it's so loud. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6754.26s)]
*  Like the commercial before, they have commercials before porn now. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6757.740000000001s)]
*  You have to sit through it for six seconds and it's always 10 decibels louder than the [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6764.219999999999s)]
*  actual porn you're going to watch. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6769.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6770.54s)]
*  Just like old commercials. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6771.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6772.54s)]
*  Remember TV shows would come on and the commercial would come on and wake you up. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6773.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6775.379999999999s)]
*  So you'll be in your hotel room trying to get some whatever, some best friend's mom porn [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6776.379999999999s)]
*  and all of a sudden it's you want that big boy. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6782.0199999999995s)]
*  You want that caught. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6784.42s)]
*  You're like, ah. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6785.42s)]
*  Lower the volume. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6786.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6787.42s)]
*  You're going to lower it down. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6788.42s)]
*  But they have that virtual porn. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6789.42s)]
*  That's going to be, I mean it's sad because we're not going to leave our houses, man. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6790.82s)]

*  It's going to be, you know what it is? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6808.9s)]
*  It's going to be WALL-E. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6809.9s)]
*  Remember WALL-E? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6810.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6811.9s)]
*  With just fat people. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6812.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6813.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6814.9s)]
*  Or Ready Player One. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6815.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6816.9s)]
*  That was a fucking great movie. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6817.9s)]
*  Great fucking movie. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6818.9s)]
*  Was it two? [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6819.98s)]
*  You said you read the book, right? [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6820.98s)]
*  The book I read, yes. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6821.98s)]
*  I mean the movie and the book for the first one were not the same thing. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6822.98s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6827.179999999999s)]
*  Two would just be a different story too. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6828.179999999999s)]
*  It'd be great though. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6829.46s)]
*  Like even my special. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6830.74s)]
*  If that was, if we did virtually, if we put a virtual camera, I think the setup is weird. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6832.74s)]
*  You have to put it in a front row seat and it has to, I don't know, it has to go up in [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6841.0199999999995s)]
*  a certain way and then you have to join these videos together. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6845.259999999999s)]
*  You have to put them together, the way you put it together. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6849.26s)]
*  But think about that. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6851.26s)]
*  If you could go, if you're all over the world, if you could go and go to my special live [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6852.26s)]
*  the night we taped it, I could have sold tickets to the special worldwide. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6856.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6861.1s)]
*  Like you're filming your next special. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6862.1s)]
*  Come see it. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6864.0599999999995s)]
*  You don't have to be where it is. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6865.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6866.26s)]
*  All over the world. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6867.26s)]
*  Come sit front row at my special for 50 bucks. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6868.26s)]
*  You can be at the special and everybody around the world puts their goggles on. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6870.84s)]
*  Is front row at your special live? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6874.92s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6878.379999999999s)]
*  That's fucking nuts. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6879.379999999999s)]
*  They have it where you're going to be able to go to football, basketball, you'll buy [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6880.58s)]
*  a season ticket to a game and you're sitting there at the game watching it live from the [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6884.219999999999s)]
*  50 yard line. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6892.259999999999s)]
*  That would be great. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6894.459999999999s)]
*  That would be great. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6895.459999999999s)]
*  That'd be great. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6896.459999999999s)]
*  Again, like the UFC thing that they're doing. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6897.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6898.459999999999s)]
*  What they're already doing. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6899.459999999999s)]
*  When is the first one supposed to happen? [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6900.459999999999s)]
*  I was trying to find the video I saw of it. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6901.459999999999s)]
*  It says it's like with UFC fight pass. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6903.94s)]
*  Was it one of the smaller productions? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6908.26s)]
*  Because UFC fight pass has a bunch of like farm sort of leagues where guys start out [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6909.26s)]
*  and then they wind up making it to the UFC afterwards. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6916.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6918.86s)]
*  LFA. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6919.86s)]
*  Yeah, LFA. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6920.86s)]
*  LFA is one of them. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6921.86s)]
*  That's a big one. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6922.86s)]
*  They just did it. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6923.86s)]
*  Oh, they did it already. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6924.86s)]
*  That's what it says. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6925.86s)]
*  It was on the 14th. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6926.86s)]
*  Do they have like a video preview of what it looks like? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6927.86s)]
*  Yeah, between that, games, porn, entertainment, movies, all that. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6930.22s)]
*  They're setting us up for the matrix. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6937.02s)]
*  It's just a slow burn and it's going to be fucking weird as shit, dude. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6939.540000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6946.02s)]
*  This is the person's view. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6947.02s)]
*  You can see their hands. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6949.02s)]
*  So that's like my seat. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6950.540000000001s)]
*  That's like my seat when I do commentary right there. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6952.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6954.9400000000005s)]
*  It seems like it does change a little bit and I don't know. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6955.9400000000005s)]
*  You probably don't have control over that from my experience watching other streams, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6958.34s)]
*  but maybe they might have changed that now too. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6962.820000000001s)]
*  It might not change views. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6965.26s)]
*  I mean, that's awesome, but there's nothing like being there. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6966.9s)]
*  No, there's getting the commentators in the air which you don't get live. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6970.339999999999s)]
*  He's bloody, but he's still very much in this fight. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6975.0599999999995s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6978.299999999999s)]
*  Nice elbow scrapes. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6979.94s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6980.94s)]
*  What is that? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6981.94s)]
*  That's the menu that popped up. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6982.94s)]
*  This is literally off of someone's helmets. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6983.94s)]
*  Oculus they were watching. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6984.94s)]
*  This is pretty fucking good. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6985.94s)]
*  This is pretty fucking good. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6986.94s)]
*  Oh, he's got the choke. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6987.94s)]
*  Can't help but commentate. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6988.94s)]
*  Oh, I'm just going to go to the next one. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6989.94s)]
*  This is pretty fucking good. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6990.94s)]
*  Oh, he's got the choke. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6991.94s)]
*  Can't help but commentate. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6992.98s)]
*  Yeah, he's got it. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6997.5s)]
*  He's turning the wrong way. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=6999.5s)]
*  He got it. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7002.339999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7003.339999999999s)]
*  There is a new lens that Canon has developed that I've seen some content made and I tested [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7004.339999999999s)]
*  it with the Oculus to see what it looked like. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7008.66s)]
*  It looks like stuff is right in front of you and you can reach out and touch it. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7010.339999999999s)]
*  It's very strange how well it looks, but the way you make that has to be an AK and it's [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7012.86s)]
*  very intensive computer process right now to get that done. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7018.0199999999995s)]
*  It's very short content. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7021.78s)]
*  You can watch it with that. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7023.099999999999s)]
*  Is it because it's too much data? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7024.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's 8K for each eye. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7027.38s)]
*  The way that that's done is it's making it on ... It's a split. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7030.5s)]
*  The lens instead of being one camera, it's splitting two and making one file. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7033.82s)]
*  I'm not even explaining it very well, so that color correction doesn't get fucked up and [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7039.18s)]
*  everything looks exactly the same from the same source. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7043.9s)]
*  It's very hard to match two things up. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7046.099999999999s)]
*  This is fast. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7048.5s)]
*  It's fast. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7049.5s)]
*  I have a grandfather who's 100 and I go, what's the greatest piece of technology you've ever [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7050.54s)]
*  seen? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7055.1s)]
*  He said the radio. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7056.1s)]
*  Fucked him up. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7058.9s)]
*  The radio fucked him up? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7059.9s)]
*  Fucked him up. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7060.98s)]
*  He goes, I couldn't believe a voice was coming out of a box from somewhere else and now to [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7061.98s)]
*  think about this shit. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7069.1s)]
*  Do you remember the story of Orson Welles, the War of the Worlds? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7070.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7074.82s)]
*  Orson Welles played ... He read from H.G. Wells, War of the Worlds. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7075.82s)]
*  It's H.G. Wells, right? [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7080.98s)]
*  The book. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7081.98s)]
*  He read the story on the air and they read it like it was news reports that were being [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7082.98s)]
*  attacked by Mars and people started freaking the fuck out because if you didn't tune in [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7090.62s)]
*  in time to hear that this is just like fucking ... This is a performance, people thought [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7097.0199999999995s)]
*  when they tuned into the radio that we're being attacked by aliens. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7102.3s)]
*  What year was that? [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7108.02s)]
*  The War of the ... 19 what? [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7109.02s)]
*  1938, Halloween. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7111.02s)]
*  So, 19 ... Halloween, 1938. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7112.02s)]
*  The infamous War of Worlds radio broadcast was a magnificent fluke. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7114.740000000001s)]
*  Orson Welles and his colleagues scrambled to pull together the show and ended up writing [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7119.1s)]
*  pop culture history. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7123.660000000001s)]
*  This was 1938 and it was ... Yeah, so it was the H.G. Wells classic, the War of the Worlds, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7126.02s)]
*  but I believe they added things to it. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7132.580000000001s)]
*  They made it seem like there was legitimate news broadcasts and it caused a nationwide [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7135.38s)]
*  hysteria. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7141.660000000001s)]
*  He was 23 years old when he did it. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7143.660000000001s)]
*  Oh, by the next morning, 23-year-old Welles' face and name were on the front page newspapers [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7145.820000000001s)]
*  coast to coast along with headlines about the mass panic his CBS broadcast had allegedly [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7153.22s)]
*  inspired. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7159.42s)]
*  I think people killed themselves. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7160.42s)]
*  What? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7162.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7163.46s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7164.46s)]
*  I think ... See if there was a suicide. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7165.46s)]
*  I think at least one ... It might have been just a report of a suicide to sensationalism [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7167.34s)]
*  because journalism was very hard to fucking vet back then. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7172.780000000001s)]
*  I wonder if that's true because I do remember saying that people killed them or reading [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7175.9400000000005s)]
*  themselves. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7183.34s)]
*  There was a lawsuit in 1960 about it. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7184.34s)]
*  Dude, I had this guy on the other day, Ryan Graves. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7187.5s)]
*  He was an advanced fighter pilot for the Navy and in 2014 they updated all of their radar [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7190.7s)]
*  systems and they started seeing UFOs everywhere. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7198.0199999999995s)]
*  So all over the East Coast in the ocean when they would travel out the ocean to run these [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7201.98s)]
*  training missions, they started seeing these objects that defied physics. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7207.34s)]
*  These objects that were like 25 feet wide, they were hovering totally stationary with [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7212.74s)]
*  130 mile an hour winds, which he said just doesn't make any sense how they could do that. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7218.46s)]
*  It wasn't drifting back and forth. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7223.18s)]
*  It was just completely stationary and then they would move off at close to the speed [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7224.860000000001s)]
*  of sound. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7228.3s)]
*  They would fly in formation. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7229.34s)]
*  They would go in and out of the ocean and he said people had reported these things before. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7231.18s)]
*  He goes, but once they updated their radar systems, they were finding these things on [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7236.74s)]
*  the radar every single flight almost. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7239.78s)]
*  He said 90% of the missions they did, they encountered these things. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7242.7s)]
*  He said they just didn't know they were there before. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7246.179999999999s)]
*  But why? [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7248.3s)]
*  I believe in aliens. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7249.86s)]
*  I believe there's other life. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7250.98s)]
*  I believe in all that shit. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7252.26s)]
*  But why don't they, I don't understand, why don't they say hi? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7254.58s)]
*  Well we don't know what the fuck they are. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7259.66s)]
*  We don't know if they're drones. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7261.74s)]
*  Is this some China shit? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7263.139999999999s)]
*  It could be. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7264.82s)]
*  We don't know if it's from another country. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7265.9s)]
*  We don't know if it's our stuff that they don't have information. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7267.66s)]
*  Like if a ship just came down right now in Austin, would you go and check it out or would [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7270.139999999999s)]
*  you go the fuck home? [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7275.58s)]
*  Go the fuck home. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7276.58s)]
*  Go the fuck home. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7277.58s)]
*  I'm not going to be the first guy that gets to eat me. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7278.58s)]
*  Imagine how when I go to the woods looking for an elk, they're going looking for a fat [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7282.299999999999s)]
*  person. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7285.82s)]
*  I'm not going to be that guy. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7286.82s)]
*  I'm not going to be that first guy that gets eaten. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7288.299999999999s)]
*  You're not going to be the people on top of the building on Independence Day, welcoming, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7290.0599999999995s)]
*  and then they just blast it out. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7294.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm out too. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7295.34s)]
*  Yeah, they're going looking for dummies. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7296.34s)]
*  I'm going right up into the woods, going to my tiny house, hopefully with the last people [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7297.58s)]
*  they find. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7302.42s)]
*  If they're here to help us, you'll find out about it eventually. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7303.42s)]
*  You don't want to be one of the first guys to get scooped up like Richard Dreyfuss in [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7305.7s)]
*  Close Encounters of the First Kind. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7308.9400000000005s)]
*  That fucking movie, that was wild shit, man. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7312.42s)]
*  I remember that movie, like all of a sudden people started seeing things in the sky. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7316.5s)]
*  They pretended they saw things. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7320.1s)]
*  Everything that science fiction, it seems like it's coming true. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7321.7s)]
*  If you look at Star Trek, we have better technology now. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7325.34s)]
*  Way better. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7328.0199999999995s)]
*  They didn't even have the internet. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7329.0199999999995s)]
*  They had walkie talkies. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7330.42s)]
*  They didn't even have cell phones. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7331.42s)]
*  It was Kirk out. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7332.42s)]
*  They didn't have video chat. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7333.42s)]
*  They didn't hang up. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7334.42s)]
*  They had a stupid flip phone. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7335.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, they could transport to another planet. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7337.22s)]
*  They had David Tell's phone. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7339.58s)]
*  I love him. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7341.0599999999995s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7346.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't anticipate the internet. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7347.0599999999995s)]
*  That was the big mind blower that no one saw coming. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7349.78s)]
*  So if they wanted to take you, you wouldn't go. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7351.38s)]
*  No chance. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7353.18s)]
*  If they were like Joe, we're big fans of your podcast. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7354.780000000001s)]

*  Is it crazy? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7443.54s)]
*  I barely could imagine being a professional comic. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7444.54s)]
*  That was the goal when we were kids. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7447.42s)]
*  The goal was, I mean, I started out with Fitzsimmons and we did open mics together, traveled together. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7449.139999999999s)]
*  And I remember we always would talk about the goal was to be a professional. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7454.42s)]
*  Imagine if we didn't have a job. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7458.94s)]
*  Imagine. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7460.26s)]
*  Because Greg back then was working for a catering company. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7461.26s)]
*  So he would do catering. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7463.98s)]
*  We'd like serve food for people. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7465.66s)]
*  And then he would go and do the open mic nights and shit like that. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7468.0199999999995s)]
*  And I was driving limos. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7470.98s)]
*  And in the beginning, I was teaching martial arts. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7472.66s)]
*  But I got to a point where I realized I could not teach the same way. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7475.86s)]
*  I was not fully invested in it. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7481.419999999999s)]
*  And it felt like it felt wrong to me. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7483.9s)]
*  I wasn't giving them my all. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7487.339999999999s)]
*  Because it was very important to me. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7489.54s)]
*  Because it was important to me as a kid. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7490.54s)]
*  When I had instructors that were really good, so then when I started running a school and [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7493.74s)]
*  I realized that I wasn't all in anymore, I had to stop. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7497.5s)]
*  So I had to stop fighting. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7501.62s)]
*  I had to stop teaching. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7502.62s)]
*  And I had to stop. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7503.86s)]
*  I really concentrate on comedy. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7504.86s)]
*  One of the things that this guy said to me, it was kind of a rude thing to say, but I [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7506.82s)]
*  knew he was right. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7510.46s)]
*  When we were like six months in, this kid, fucking Jonathan, I forget his last name. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7511.78s)]
*  But he was one of the guys that I started out with. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7517.58s)]
*  And we were all open micers. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7519.74s)]
*  We were all just talking about comedy and this and that. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7521.86s)]
*  And he said to me, he goes, yeah, he started out really good. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7523.9s)]
*  He goes, but it seems like somewhere along the line you just started kind of coasting. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7526.94s)]
*  And I was like, ugh. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7530.18s)]
*  I couldn't say anything. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7533.38s)]
*  I couldn't go, fuck you. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7534.38s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, he's right. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7535.38s)]
*  I remember thinking that. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7537.3s)]
*  He's right. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7538.38s)]
*  He wasn't being mean. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7539.38s)]
*  He was just being honest. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7541.54s)]
*  And it hurt because it was accurate. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7542.54s)]
*  And I remember thinking, and he wasn't trying to be a dick either. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7545.14s)]
*  He was just telling me. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7547.46s)]
*  And I remember thinking, oh man, he's right. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7549.3s)]
*  And I immediately said, I have to quit. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7552.38s)]
*  I have to quit fighting. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7554.9s)]
*  I have to quit teaching. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7555.9s)]
*  I have to quit. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7556.9s)]
*  I have to be all in on this comedy thing. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7557.9s)]
*  Comedy is you have to be married. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7560.22s)]
*  It has to be your lover. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7561.22s)]
*  You've got to be all in. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7562.22s)]
*  I remember you gave me the best advice ever. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7563.22s)]
*  You remember the first gig we ever did together? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7565.06s)]
*  What did I say? [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7567.42s)]
*  A Cool Cool. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7568.42s)]
*  Remember that? [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7569.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, Dick Daugherty. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7570.42s)]
*  Comedy Hut. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7571.42s)]
*  Remember that? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7572.42s)]
*  It was in Cambridge. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7573.42s)]
*  What did I say? [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7574.42s)]
*  I saw you do that comedy, the MTV thing. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7576.38s)]
*  You were my guy. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7579.9400000000005s)]
*  You were the guy that I was like, that's comedy to me. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7581.68s)]
*  All this other seven minute bullshit. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7584.58s)]
*  And there was just garbage to me. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7587.02s)]
*  So I finally, Dick Daugherty, you were coming to town. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7590.38s)]
*  And I was like, Dick, I want to work with Joe. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7593.14s)]
*  Please, please, please. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7595.1s)]
*  And he put me on the show with you. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7596.1s)]
*  And I ran up to you after the first show. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7597.1s)]
*  And I was like, hey man. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7600.38s)]
*  And you were so cool. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7601.38s)]
*  And I was like, hey man, can you please give me advice? [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7602.38s)]
*  What do I do? [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7605.62s)]
*  Just give me a little advice. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7606.62s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, no fucking advice. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7607.62s)]
*  Don't take any advice from any comic ever. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7609.66s)]
*  Ever. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7612.26s)]
*  Just get on stage. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7613.26s)]
*  That's all you have to do. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7614.42s)]
*  Get on stage and become who you're going to become. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7615.54s)]
*  This business will shit you out or you'll be a comic. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7618.36s)]
*  And you'll figure out who you're supposed to be by getting on stage. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7620.86s)]
*  If I tell you what to do, you're going to be fucked. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7623.9400000000005s)]
*  Don't listen to anybody. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7627.82s)]
*  Just do stand up. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7629.1s)]
*  That's all you told me. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7630.82s)]
*  That was it. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7632.9800000000005s)]
*  Pretty solid advice. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7633.9800000000005s)]
*  Best advice I ever got. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7634.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean really. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7635.9800000000005s)]
*  Best advice I ever got. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7636.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I think I would revise that. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7637.9800000000005s)]
*  I would say people can give you advice. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7640.5s)]
*  They can give you advice on economy of words. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7642.02s)]
*  They can give you advice on how to develop timing and how to not present your jokes. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7645.14s)]
*  How to just kind of be yourself on stage. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7652.38s)]
*  As you get better, sure. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7654.5s)]
*  But as a young comic, just getting on, getting on stage was the key. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7655.900000000001s)]
*  I think back then I was 24 or 25. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7661.54s)]
*  You might have been 25. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7665.18s)]
*  I think I was 23 or something. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7666.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7667.18s)]
*  How old are you now? [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7668.18s)]
*  52. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7669.18s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7670.18s)]
*  I'm 55. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7671.18s)]
*  Okay. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7672.18s)]
*  So I was three years old. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7673.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7674.18s)]
*  So we were just kind of figuring it out. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7675.18s)]
*  And I was just becoming a pro back then. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7676.18s)]
*  That was when I was already living in New York and going back and forth to Boston. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7678.82s)]
*  And I was just legitimately becoming a headliner. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7684.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7688.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7689.02s)]
*  I mean, I remember we did it, the show. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7690.02s)]
*  And I did great. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7692.42s)]
*  I thought I did great. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7694.22s)]
*  And you went up and you were like, what's up? [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7695.22s)]
*  And you had this, I don't know, intense. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7697.780000000001s)]
*  It was over. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7701.46s)]
*  It was a different show. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7702.46s)]
*  And I remember you just went up and you murdered at a Chinese restaurant in Cambridge. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7703.46s)]
*  Those are the best. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7708.5s)]
*  Those are the best days. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7709.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7710.780000000001s)]
*  I loved those days. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7711.780000000001s)]
*  Those days were fun. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7712.780000000001s)]
*  No responsibility. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7713.780000000001s)]
*  No money. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7714.780000000001s)]
*  No money. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7715.780000000001s)]
*  No money. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7716.780000000001s)]
*  It wasn't about money. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7717.780000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7718.780000000001s)]

*  for Hollywood just felt so gross to them. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7833.28s)]
*  They just couldn't take it for very long and they want to bail him. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7835.84s)]
*  We all were tricked into thinking that the only way to be a professional comic was to [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7842.12s)]
*  get on television. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7846.2s)]
*  That was all anybody wanted you to do. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7847.88s)]
*  That was the holy grail was to become Roseanne Barr or to become Jerry Seinfeld, to have [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7850.24s)]
*  your own sitcom. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7856.16s)]
*  That was the thing. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7857.16s)]
*  So we all went out there and just like you got integrated into this weird fucking system [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7858.16s)]
*  it just felt so the opposite of what we got in it to do. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7863.84s)]
*  What we got in it to do is to become Sam Kinison. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7868.04s)]
*  We got in it to become those comics that we would want to go pay to see. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7870.32s)]
*  I would always get fucked up going to LA too because I've been skinny and fat my whole [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7875.24s)]
*  life and I would always be on one of my fats when I had to go to LA and I felt like shit [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7880.36s)]
*  because everybody's ... I always just felt fucked up when I went out there. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7887.44s)]
*  I was just not what I was supposed to be. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7892.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7896.84s)]
*  Because I felt like you're supposed to look a certain way. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7897.84s)]
*  You're supposed to be a certain way physically. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7902.6s)]
*  That's not what comedy ... Comedy you can be whatever the fuck you want. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7906.44s)]
*  That's why I love Louis' special and he had stains on his shirt on one of his specials. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=7910.04s)]

*  That night some kid got a pencil in his eye from another kid. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8410.36s)]
*  And then you go into this room with just bunk beds, steel bunk beds filled in the room. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8416.44s)]
*  And the highway, I don't remember the Charlestown Y, the highway with 93 was right there. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8422.08s)]

*  Jesus Christ. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8443.56s)]
*  Because once you're in, you're in. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8444.56s)]
*  So if your mom had just paid that 10 bucks you would have never been in. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8447.68s)]

*  I got sober at 15. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8478.72s)]
*  I went to a place called the Road Back. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8480.8s)]
*  I got arrested again, upstate New York. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8483.16s)]
*  They shipped me back to Boston because I was a ward of the state, you're owned by Massachusetts. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8485.36s)]
*  So they shipped me back down. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8491.480000000001s)]
*  I went back to jail and then I finally realized like, look, drugs and alcohol, that's what [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8492.800000000001s)]
*  it is. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8499.12s)]
*  It's not people, places and things. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8500.12s)]
*  It's my drinking. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8501.12s)]
*  It's my drugs. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8502.12s)]
*  I go, I need to go somewhere. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8503.44s)]
*  What drugs? [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8504.800000000001s)]
*  Everything. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8505.800000000001s)]
*  I did everything. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8506.800000000001s)]
*  Anything you put in front of me. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8507.800000000001s)]
*  I wasn't doing drugs because I like drugs. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8508.84s)]
*  I was doing drugs because I didn't want to be alone anymore. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8511.28s)]
*  I didn't want to go back to that basement by myself. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8514.160000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8517.800000000001s)]
*  I didn't want to be that anymore. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8518.880000000001s)]
*  That was terrifying to me. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8520.560000000001s)]
*  So if I had to do drugs or I had to drink, I would do whatever the fuck it took to have [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8522.400000000001s)]
*  friends, to have a group of people to belong because I didn't have anybody. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8529.36s)]
*  So these kids, I got to the point where we would move around. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8535.240000000002s)]
*  I'd get out of the jail. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8539.28s)]
*  I'd go to a foster home and then I would go home from there. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8540.76s)]
*  And my parents were somewhere else. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8544.48s)]
*  Like they were in Spenceport, New York. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8546.039999999999s)]
*  They were in Ben Salon, Pennsylvania. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8548.519999999999s)]
*  And what I would do is I'd go on the first day of school and I would get into trouble, [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8552.24s)]
*  go to detention because those are my kids. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8557.4s)]
*  So I'd get in trouble, go to detention and I'd always have weed. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8559.88s)]
*  I'd always have a couple of joints. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8564.08s)]
*  And as soon as I got to detention, I'd lean over to the toughest looking kid. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8565.56s)]
*  I'd be like, you want to smoke some weed? [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8568.72s)]
*  Friends, immediate friends. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8570.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8572.6s)]
*  We'd smoke weed and those are my guys. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8573.24s)]
*  And then I'd hang up with them for the duration until in Ben Salon, I wound up running away [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8576.2s)]
*  and getting arrested again. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8581.84s)]
*  And then in, what was it? [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8583.640000000001s)]
*  Spenceport, New York was the last time. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8585.24s)]
*  I got drunk. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8587.68s)]
*  We fucking stole gumball machines. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8589.12s)]
*  I went to jail for gumball machines. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8592.2s)]
*  It was stupid. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8593.720000000001s)]
*  It was terrible. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8596.12s)]
*  Because, you know, I mean, we got I drank a half a bottle of scotch. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8596.76s)]
*  I drank a bunch of beers and we did whippets and they were like, I want these gumball machines. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8601.36s)]
*  So I just took them and smashed them. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8607.44s)]
*  And the cops came. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8609.56s)]
*  I remember I was running from the cops down the railroad tracks. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8610.880000000001s)]
*  I hopped the fence. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8613.960000000001s)]
*  And as soon as I hopped the fence, there was a shotgun right in my face. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8615.52s)]
*  And the guy made me get down the cop. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8619.16s)]
*  He's like, freeze down the ground and goes, if he moves, shoot him. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8620.6s)]
*  I was like, it was gum. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8624.44s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8626.48s)]
*  They took me to jail up there. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8627.16s)]
*  And it was that was the worst. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8629.92s)]
*  Rochester, New York was the worst. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8631.52s)]
*  I've ever been in. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8632.76s)]
*  And, you know, they put me in a room and that was the first time I literally asked for help. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8633.88s)]
*  I was just like, help me, please. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8639.68s)]
*  Just help me. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8642.6s)]
*  I'm done. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8643.6s)]
*  I know. I know it's drugs. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8645.08s)]
*  I know it's alcohol. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8646.52s)]
*  Please help me get help. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8647.92s)]
*  I need it. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8649.64s)]
*  Whatever. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8650.76s)]
*  I just gave up. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8651.279999999999s)]
*  I gave up the first time. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8652.800000000001s)]
*  I was like, this is it. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8654.84s)]
*  And then I went to jail to Boston. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8656.36s)]
*  They flew me on a plane. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8660.28s)]
*  Remember, I was smoking on the plane. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8661.68s)]
*  I asked the flight attendant, can you give me a light? [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8664.36s)]
*  She just got me a light. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8666.04s)]
*  I lit up in the fucking plane. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8666.92s)]
*  You could smoke on planes. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8668.880000000001s)]
*  Smoke on planes. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8669.72s)]
*  I was 15. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8670.2s)]
*  And right when I got off the plane, there was two state troopers waiting for me and [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8671.880000000001s)]
*  they handcuffed me, took me to jail. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8675.32s)]
*  And then I met this guy in NFI shelter care. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8678.12s)]
*  Was this Yitzhak. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8683.52s)]
*  His name is Yitzhak. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8685.2s)]
*  He developed this system for juveniles that it was called open door setting, normalization. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8686.44s)]
*  There was no locks on the doors at NFI. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8696.16s)]
*  There was no guards. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8698.52s)]
*  They had people there at night, but you could run. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8700.68s)]
*  You could leave. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8703.72s)]
*  Walk right out the fucking door. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8704.68s)]
*  But they incentivized you. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8707.12s)]
*  30 days, you got steak. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8708.960000000001s)]
*  60 days without a run, lobster dinners. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8711.160000000002s)]
*  They gave you responsibility as a kid. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8714.76s)]
*  And we all kind of formed together to kind of keep each other in check to receive these [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8717.960000000001s)]
*  benefits. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8724.36s)]
*  And they gave you help. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8725.640000000001s)]
*  They talked to you. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8728.160000000002s)]
*  Instead of these other places, you just went in and did your time. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8729.68s)]
*  This place was all on you. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8732.640000000001s)]
*  We had school. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8734.6s)]
*  They took us to the beach. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8736.56s)]
*  They loaded us in the... [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8738.32s)]
*  I remember they took all these juvies. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8739.32s)]
*  We'd load up in a van and go to Gloucester, a Winger Sheik beach, and we'd just sit on [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8740.68s)]
*  the beach and have fun. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8745.359999999999s)]
*  They gave you these incentivized things to not leave. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8747.119999999999s)]
*  And then the guy came up to me. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8751.76s)]
*  He's like, you can go to rehab. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8753.519999999999s)]
*  We got you set up. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8754.96s)]
*  You can go to six months co-ed or you can go to a year all boys. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8755.96s)]
*  And I was like, what do I do? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8761.48s)]
*  He's like, knowing you, year all boys. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8764.0s)]
*  If you go with his girls, you'll fuck up. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8766.4s)]
*  You'll fuck up. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8769.119999999999s)]
*  You'll try to bang the chicks. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8770.119999999999s)]
*  You'll try to have sex and you'll fuck it up. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8771.56s)]
*  So I did. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8774.24s)]
*  I listened. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8775.24s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8776.24s)]
*  And I went to the road back. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8777.24s)]
*  It was a house, again, normalization, no bars, no nothing. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8778.24s)]
*  I showed up and I was sitting in this room. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8782.359999999999s)]
*  This guy, Tom Tompkins, used to be... [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8785.039999999999s)]
*  Had a lot of money. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8788.8s)]
*  His wife was a famous opera singer. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8790.039999999999s)]
*  He was in show business and he lost it all from alcoholism and drugs. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8792.640000000001s)]
*  So he started this house called The Road Back. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8798.32s)]
*  And I remember I was sitting there, petrified, and all of a sudden he comes down. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8801.4s)]

*  You know, the first day out, 14 months later. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8972.2s)]
*  I haven't seen my family for over a year. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8974.2s)]
*  And I got out and I asked the guy, I go, what do I do? [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8978.2s)]
*  He goes, go to a meeting far enough away where you can't walk home. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=8982.2s)]

*  You were doing your thing. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9464.640000000001s)]
*  But other... [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9465.640000000001s)]
*  You mean like at open mic nights? [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9466.640000000001s)]
*  No, like at the clubs, the standups, because they would have to follow us on a show and [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9468.44s)]
*  we would go up and just shred it as a group. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9474.480000000001s)]
*  And they didn't like that? [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9478.84s)]
*  Remember the BCN comedy riot? [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9479.84s)]
*  Sure. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9482.28s)]
*  Okay. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9483.28s)]
*  So we were killing it. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9484.28s)]
*  We were fucking murdering it. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9485.28s)]
*  All of a sudden we get in the BCN comedy riot, the first comedy improv group, sketch group [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9487.12s)]
*  to ever get in. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9491.52s)]
*  It was all standups. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9492.52s)]
*  It was the biggest comedy competition in the world at that time. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9493.52s)]
*  Amateur comedy competition. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9498.92s)]
*  So we got in it as a group. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9500.720000000001s)]
*  And I remember we went in to BCN. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9503.4s)]
*  Remember how big BCN was? [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9506.560000000001s)]
*  Mark Parenta. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9508.36s)]
*  Sure. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9509.36s)]
*  Okay. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9510.36s)]
*  He brought us in and we went into BCN and we were on the radio because he loved us. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9512.28s)]
*  The first round he was like, I love these Alan the Monkeys, these Alan the Monkeys. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9518.52s)]
*  He brought us in. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9522.08s)]
*  We fucking killed on BCN. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9523.08s)]
*  And this was actually a case where he did want to fuck us. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9525.84s)]
*  Mark, yeah. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9528.24s)]
*  My instincts were right on that one. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9531.68s)]
*  He got in trouble for that, right? [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9533.68s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9536.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9537.48s)]
*  Didn't he get kicked off the air for that? [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9538.48s)]
*  Like lost his job? [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9539.72s)]
*  He was gone by then, but I think he was in DC. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9541.68s)]
*  And then he was, yeah, I think he was giving kids Sony PlayStations. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9543.64s)]
*  But we just, I mean. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9547.72s)]
*  Solid deal. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9550.8s)]
*  I mean, it's not an Atari. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9552.519999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9554.56s)]
*  He was, yeah, but I remember we won that competition and we got, the winners got to play the BCN [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9557.08s)]
*  comedy riot. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9565.32s)]
*  I mean, the BCN, whatever, the Rock of Boston. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9566.32s)]
*  And the year, it's always been at the Paradise, which is 600 people. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9570.48s)]
*  It's great. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9573.279999999999s)]
*  They switched it that year to the Garden. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9574.279999999999s)]
*  We're so cocky and we're so fucking full of ourselves that we're like, yeah, we'll do [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9577.960000000001s)]
*  it. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9583.6s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9584.6s)]
*  We didn't even think about it. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9585.6s)]
*  We don't understand it. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9586.6s)]
*  You know, we're doing sketch comedy and improv. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9587.6s)]
*  There's 14,000 people showing up. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9590.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9593.0s)]
*  We just show up at the Garden. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9595.12s)]
*  We're hanging with the spin doctors. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9596.32s)]
*  Our dressing room is the girls bathroom. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9598.52s)]
*  So all the girls have to come to our bathroom to pee and that's our dressing room. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9602.2s)]
*  What? [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9606.68s)]
*  Fish was the headliner. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9608.0s)]
*  They put us in between fish. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9609.84s)]
*  No, the spin doctors went up, little miss, little miss, can't be wrong, at the heat of [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9611.84s)]
*  that. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9616.800000000001s)]
*  And right before fish, which is fucking nuts, we were going up to do sketches and improv. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9618.64s)]
*  How much time did you guys do? [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9626.0s)]
*  We had to do 15 minutes and they brought us out in front of 14,000 people. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9627.2s)]
*  We all had, I don't know, I think it was Dane's idea. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9631.0s)]
*  We all had different colored shirts. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9633.56s)]
*  So we looked like a boy band. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9635.76s)]
*  We all squatted down and then when they announced us, we jumped up and spun to the crowd. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9640.36s)]
*  We just went, what's up? [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9647.44s)]
*  Dude, it went bad so fast. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9649.800000000001s)]
*  Billy Burr was actually in the crowd. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9653.36s)]
*  He went to see the show. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9654.800000000001s)]
*  He was there. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9657.16s)]
*  It was terrible. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9658.16s)]
*  It went bad so fast. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9659.16s)]
*  I remember we were doing a skit and there was one dude in the front, keep going, keep [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9660.92s)]
*  going. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9667.96s)]
*  He was like, I love it. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9668.96s)]
*  And we had to do an improv. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9670.4s)]
*  We did a sketch. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9672.88s)]
*  It bombed. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9673.88s)]
*  It bombed. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9674.88s)]
*  You could hear rustling. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9675.88s)]
*  Just nuts. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9678.16s)]
*  It was so bad. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9679.16s)]
*  I wound up taking my shirt off. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9680.16s)]
*  I was in shape at that time. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9681.84s)]
*  And I was like, listen people, we know you didn't come here to see comedy. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9683.56s)]
*  You came here to see the spin doctors. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9688.480000000001s)]
*  You want to see fish. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9691.52s)]
*  But we're going to leave in a second. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9692.960000000001s)]
*  But give us three things that piss you off for our improv. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9696.4s)]
*  Just fucking shoes and lighters started coming to the stage. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9700.44s)]
*  They started singing. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9703.4s)]
*  Hey, goodbye. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9706.4s)]
*  Just grew and grew and grew. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9709.68s)]
*  We had to walk off stage, go to the back. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9712.4s)]
*  People were staring at us. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9715.54s)]
*  I just sat there devastated. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9717.12s)]
*  It was so bad. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9718.92s)]
*  Is that your first time bombing? [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9720.2s)]
*  Dude, it was my first time bombing, but my first time epically bombing. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9721.56s)]
*  In front of 14,000 people. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9726.6s)]
*  The comedy world knew before we knew that we bombed. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9728.039999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9732.52s)]
*  We were the motherfuckers and we were that in a second. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9733.92s)]
*  Alan Dane left me. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9739.68s)]
*  They were supposed to pick me up up front. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9741.68s)]
*  I'm standing out front waiting for them to pick me out. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9743.28s)]
*  As the concert lets out, I'm by a pay phone going, where the fuck are you guys? [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9745.48s)]
*  They're like, oh, we went home. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9749.76s)]
*  They left me. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9751.48s)]
*  I had my uncle to come pick me up. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9752.48s)]
*  People just walking by pointing at me like, there he is. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9754.88s)]
*  That's him. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9757.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was terrifying. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9758.439999999999s)]
*  It was deadly. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9759.439999999999s)]
*  I thought my career was over. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9760.439999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9762.08s)]
*  Before it began. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9763.08s)]
*  Before it began. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9764.08s)]
*  That's what I said. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9765.08s)]
*  I was like, fuck this group shit. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9766.08s)]
*  How much time had you been doing stand up for? [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9767.08s)]
*  Like a year and a half maybe. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9768.439999999999s)]
*  So when I met you and you were with Alan the Monkeys, that was around that time. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9770.640000000001s)]
*  It's probably after that and we started doing stand up. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9777.28s)]
*  We were like, we all got to do stand up. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9780.16s)]
*  We all got to go on our own, do some stand up. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9782.16s)]
*  Well, what you guys were doing when I met you is you would do sketches and then you [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9784.84s)]
*  would each do like five minutes of stand up. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9788.800000000001s)]
*  That's what we started doing after. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=9790.800000000001s)]

*  Because I was like, I got to learn how to fight. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10327.0s)]
*  That's why I put my kid Maximus in Jiu Jitsu. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10329.199999999999s)]

*  Yeah, it's so important for kids to learn how to defend themselves. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10341.2s)]
*  It'll just let you avoid fights. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10344.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10347.24s)]
*  You know, I remember one time I was in Fenway Park, like that area and like Kenmore Square. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10348.24s)]
*  And I was walking down the street and these fucking kids, I forget if it was two or three [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10356.44s)]
*  kids, I think it was two kids. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10362.4s)]
*  And they were like just street kids, like shitty kids. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10364.04s)]
*  And he's like, hey man, could I borrow some money? [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10368.16s)]
*  And I go, I don't have any money. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10371.439999999999s)]
*  He goes, come on man, I know you got some fucking money. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10372.439999999999s)]

*  You know, and he goes, man, I'll just fucking take your money. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10377.4s)]
*  I go, okay. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10380.119999999999s)]
*  And I keep walking. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10381.64s)]
*  He goes, where the fuck are you going? [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10382.64s)]
*  And I got to the door of the Taekwondo Academy where I was teaching. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10383.64s)]
*  And I go, I'm going up here to teach a class. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10387.88s)]
*  I go, do you want to come up? [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10391.48s)]
*  And we were like looking at each other. [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10394.64s)]
*  And he's like, you're teaching a class? [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10397.32s)]
*  I go, yeah. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10398.32s)]
*  And that's when he understood why I was so confident. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10399.32s)]
*  I was trying to figure out, do I kick this guy's head off of his fucking shoulders? [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10402.32s)]
*  Or do I just calmly walk up to the door and go, I'm going up here to teach a class. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10406.48s)]
*  It was one of the more interesting moments in my life because it was a moment where having [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10411.439999999999s)]
*  confidence and really knowing how to fight. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10416.64s)]
*  And by that time I was like 17, I had knocked a bunch of people out by then. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10419.88s)]
*  I was used to it. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10423.64s)]
*  I know how to do it. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10424.64s)]
*  And I remember just that confidence kept, like it was confusing for him. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10425.64s)]
*  And he's like, man, I know you got some money. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10431.64s)]
*  I go, no, I don't have any money for you. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10433.64s)]
*  And then when we got to the door, it was like perfect timing, like right when they were [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10435.64s)]
*  starting to escalate shit. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10439.64s)]
*  And in the door, the door was a logo of a guy flying through the air, kicking another [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10441.64s)]
*  guy in the head. [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10446.64s)]
*  That was the Jae-hun Kim Taekwondo Institute. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10447.64s)]
*  I took karate for a while. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10450.64s)]

*  Come on, man. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10457.64s)]
*  That's my favorite version of Elvis, peeled up doing karate. [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10458.64s)]
*  With a gi. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10462.4s)]
*  Come on, man. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10463.4s)]
*  With a gi with a giant collared shirt under the gi. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10464.4s)]
*  Under the gi, yeah. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10467.0s)]
*  I took it for a while, but I split my gi. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10468.24s)]
*  I got fat again. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10472.0s)]
*  My first girlfriend, when we met, we were both in shape. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10476.96s)]
*  I was taking karate. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10481.64s)]
*  She took karate with me. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10483.4s)]
*  We would go and do karate. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10484.72s)]
*  But like any relationship, you start getting lazy. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10487.08s)]
*  We started going to the all-you-can-eat Italian buffet across the street on Route Run. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10489.52s)]
*  And then I remember one time I went in with like sauce stains on my gi. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10493.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10496.92s)]
*  And then I quit when I split my gi. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10497.92s)]
*  I went down to do a stupid split at the beginning when you're stretching and shit and my gi [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10499.8s)]
*  just ripped and I just never went back. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10505.16s)]
*  Ever. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10508.279999999999s)]

*  where they fucking rearrange your shit. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10523.52s)]
*  There's the sleeve. [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10525.800000000001s)]
*  No, the two, what is it called? [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10528.800000000001s)]
*  The ring. [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10531.800000000001s)]
*  The band. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10532.800000000001s)]

*  And then the sleeve is the least invasive. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10537.92s)]
*  It's laparoscopic and they just make your stomach smaller. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10541.36s)]
*  So it goes from whatever it was into the size of a banana. [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10546.14s)]
*  And I had to do it. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10550.2s)]

*  Just a bunch of fucking men. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10651.52s)]
*  And smoke cigars, talk shit, watch games, whatever. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10653.640000000001s)]
*  One of the guys in there is this dude, our pan, and he's wound up talking to him. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10657.44s)]
*  He's a surgeon. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10662.240000000002s)]
*  He does these operations. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10663.240000000002s)]
*  Three years ago I started talking to him. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10664.800000000001s)]
*  And I was like, you know, I'm gonna do it. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10667.08s)]
*  I'm gonna get it done and maybe we'll talk. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10670.400000000001s)]
*  We kept doing that and I couldn't do it, dude. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10672.160000000002s)]
*  I couldn't get it. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10673.880000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm gonna die. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10675.320000000002s)]
*  I had sleep apnea. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10678.16s)]
*  My feet would tangle in. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10679.519999999999s)]
*  My heart rate was up. [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10682.32s)]
*  I was gonna be gone. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10684.24s)]
*  I was gonna stroke out. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10685.24s)]
*  It was just, you know, either I do it or I don't. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10686.519999999999s)]
*  And finally I talked to him and I'm like, what do I gotta do? [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10688.88s)]
*  And he's like, you have to lose this weight before you can't just get the surgery. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10691.88s)]
*  You have to lose weight. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10696.24s)]
*  You have to get your BMI down. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10698.4s)]
*  You have to see a nutritionist. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10699.8s)]
*  You have to see a dietician. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10700.92s)]
*  You have to change the way you're eating before you do the surgery. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10702.519999999999s)]
*  You have to start this first. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10705.82s)]
*  I was like, great. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10707.34s)]
*  We planned it out. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10709.1s)]
*  I was like, I can do it at this time. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10710.26s)]
*  And I got my BMI down and I went in for the surgery. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10713.14s)]
*  And the night of the surgery, I was walking. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10719.42s)]
*  He's like, you gotta walk tonight and tomorrow and every day you have to walk. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10721.58s)]
*  The night I can only walk the hall once. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10726.9s)]
*  I went home the next day. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10729.86s)]
*  I could walk down my driveway and walk back up. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10731.06s)]
*  The next day I walked down the driveway, walked down the block. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10733.82s)]
*  I came back. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10736.26s)]
*  The next day I walked up and down the block. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10737.26s)]
*  The day after that I walked around the block. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10739.539999999999s)]
*  I just kept going, walking and walking and walking. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10741.74s)]
*  Because I knew the key to life is exercise. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10745.699999999999s)]
*  It's the fountain of youth. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10750.26s)]
*  And I would be on the road with Louie and he would exercise every day. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10752.42s)]
*  I would see these people. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10756.94s)]
*  It's the key. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10758.98s)]
*  It's the fountain of youth. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10759.98s)]
*  I just gotta move. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10760.98s)]
*  I don't have to do all this other shit. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10761.98s)]
*  I don't have to get a trainer. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10765.02s)]
*  I don't have to do a... [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10766.26s)]
*  I just have to move. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10767.539999999999s)]
*  Just move. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10769.74s)]
*  And so that's all I did. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10771.699999999999s)]
*  But the operation allowed me to not... [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10773.779999999999s)]
*  My addiction couldn't take over. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10778.279999999999s)]
*  If I eat too much, I get sick. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10780.06s)]
*  So it allowed me the moments of clarity to understand I'm not hungry right now, but I'm [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10781.859999999999s)]
*  hungry. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10787.619999999999s)]
*  There's also a thing in your stomach. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10788.619999999999s)]
*  This isn't theory. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10791.04s)]
*  This isn't... [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10792.04s)]
*  This is a theory. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10793.04s)]
*  There's ghrelin cells in your stomach that tell you you're hungry. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10794.04s)]
*  So when you remove, in theory, when you remove... [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10800.92s)]
*  And I don't want to get male. [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10804.400000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying when you remove that stomach, those cells go with it. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10806.640000000001s)]
*  So you have less of those cells. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10810.04s)]
*  So that helps you. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10812.6s)]
*  It helps you not feel that hunger when you're not hungry. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10814.960000000001s)]
*  It seems like also you change your pattern. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10818.8s)]
*  And once you develop a new pattern, you could really... [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10820.92s)]
*  That pattern, if you stick with it and you get momentum, that pattern can become your [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10823.84s)]
*  new way of thinking, your new way of life. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10829.48s)]
*  That's how it is whenever I get really serious and start doing something very serious. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10831.759999999998s)]
*  It becomes my new thing. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10837.08s)]
*  And then it becomes easier to do because it's just a part of the day. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10838.96s)]
*  This is what I do now. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10842.32s)]
*  And then I get obsessed about staying on that pattern. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10843.64s)]
*  That's the thing I couldn't get to. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10847.960000000001s)]
*  That's the thing I couldn't get to. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10850.28s)]
*  But now I lift weights now because you got to lift weights. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10851.36s)]
*  Your phone is listening to you. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10857.960000000001s)]
*  What? [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10859.6s)]
*  Yeah, your Siri just kicked on, that bitch. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10860.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's been, I think, four months and my whole life has changed. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10865.36s)]
*  That's amazing. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10871.24s)]
*  Sleep apnea is gone. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10872.24s)]
*  Resting heart rate's like 58 or 52 sometimes. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10874.04s)]
*  I walk every day. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10877.76s)]
*  I lift weights three or four times a week. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10879.4s)]
*  My pain is gone. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10883.56s)]
*  My aches and pains are gone. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10884.56s)]
*  That's fucking awesome. [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10886.08s)]
*  Everything's gone. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10887.08s)]
*  Beautiful. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10888.08s)]
*  I had a pain in the back of my ear that if you touched it, it was like somebody stabbing [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10889.08s)]
*  me. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10892.679999999998s)]
*  It's gone. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10893.679999999998s)]
*  Nobody knew what it was. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10894.679999999998s)]
*  It's gone. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10896.039999999999s)]
*  It was weight-related. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10897.039999999999s)]
*  Probably pushing down on a nerve, all that inflammation. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10898.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's all gone. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10902.8s)]
*  I'm like, I learned how to slow down. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10905.880000000001s)]
*  I learned how to eat the right foods. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10909.84s)]
*  I learned how to move, just move, even if it's a mile, just walking. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10912.36s)]
*  My whole demeanor changed. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10919.320000000002s)]
*  There was two days I didn't work out and I was fucking grumpy and pissed. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10920.640000000001s)]

*  I went like this. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10925.720000000001s)]
*  I didn't move today. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10926.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10927.720000000001s)]
*  I went and I just jumped on the treadmill for a half hour and my fucking day lit up. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10928.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10933.960000000001s)]
*  Your endorphins kick in. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10935.119999999999s)]
*  Your anxiety goes away. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10937.24s)]
*  Anxiety. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10938.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10939.8s)]
*  I'm less ornery. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10940.8s)]
*  I'm less angry. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10941.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10942.8s)]
*  I can do flying as a fat fuck. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10943.8s)]
*  Hard. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10949.56s)]
*  You develop fat tricks. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10950.96s)]
*  I have a bunch of fat tricks. [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10952.56s)]
*  I remember dropping your ear pod on the plane in mid-flight. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10956.199999999999s)]
*  Was devastating. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10961.16s)]
*  You just couldn't get it. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10962.16s)]
*  I would just kick it over to the skinny guy next to me. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10964.36s)]
*  I'd be like, dude, can you get that for me? [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY1u20cx02A&t=10966.960000000001s)]
