**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up man? Pleasure to meet you. What's happening? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=12.0s)]
*  Pleasure to be here, Joe. Thanks for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=14.0s)]
*  Listen, my honor, I love your music. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=16.0s)]
*  I got introduced to you by Duncan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=18.0s)]
*  We were in the green room of the mothership, and Duncan goes, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=20.0s)]
*  you gotta hear this, and he puts on Family Ties. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=23.0s)]
*  And I went, damn, that's a good fucking song. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=26.0s)]
*  And then we played Q Country Roads, and then we just got on a roll. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=29.0s)]
*  And then like the whole night we played your music. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=32.0s)]
*  Hell yeah, dude. It was fucking awesome. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=34.0s)]
*  He was telling me that, you know, he showed my music to you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=36.0s)]
*  He said normally you don't like his recommendations. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=39.0s)]
*  Well, he'll go a little emo on you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=42.0s)]
*  But he said that you dug that, and I was like, holy shit, man, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=47.0s)]
*  isn't that something? Duncan was really cool. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=50.0s)]
*  I was like, I was at Apple Studios in Nashville [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=53.0s)]
*  doing this live session thing with him when he messaged me on Twitter [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=57.0s)]
*  and asked me to be on his podcast. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=61.0s)]
*  And that made my freaking week. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=63.0s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, Duncan Trussell likes my music? Fuck yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=65.0s)]
*  And then we were doing his podcast, and then afterwards he's like, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=70.0s)]
*  yeah, man, I showed your music to Joe, and he really liked it too. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=73.0s)]
*  I was like, fuck yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=76.0s)]
*  So yeah, shout out to Duncan. I appreciate him doing that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=78.0s)]
*  No, Duncan's the man. He is one of the most unusual people [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=81.0s)]
*  that I've ever met in my life. There's not another one like him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=83.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's cracking me up. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=86.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a one of one. That's a one of one. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=88.0s)]
*  When he moved here, I was so happy because he went to Asheville [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=91.0s)]
*  because he grew up in Asheville, and he moved there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=95.0s)]
*  And it was just during the pandemic, he got bleak there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=99.0s)]
*  The jobs were all dried up. Everything was fucked. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=103.0s)]
*  Everything closed down. And he said crime was crazy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=106.0s)]
*  Asheville is per capita in the top 10 of crime in the country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=109.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=114.0s)]
*  I might have made that up. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=115.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=117.0s)]
*  Let's see if that's a fact. I'm pretty sure Duncan told me that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=118.0s)]
*  But he's like, dude, there's so much fucking crime. It's everywhere. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=122.0s)]
*  Everyone's on meth. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=125.0s)]
*  Your Duncan impersonation is way better than mine. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=126.0s)]
*  But we recorded the album there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=129.0s)]
*  Oh, no shit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=131.0s)]
*  We were there for two weeks last January. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=132.0s)]
*  And it's like sleepy this time of year, I guess. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=134.0s)]
*  Their tourism is at its lowest in January. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=138.0s)]
*  And dude, I loved it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=142.0s)]
*  It's gorgeous. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=144.0s)]
*  I love the town. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=145.0s)]
*  And it had some some homeless and stuff like that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=146.0s)]
*  But damn, I didn't know that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=150.0s)]
*  I went there back in, I think I did a gig there in 2015 or 16, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=151.0s)]
*  somewhere around then. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=157.0s)]
*  I was like, God damn, what a great town. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=158.0s)]
*  Just the perfect size, not too big, cool, artsy, beautiful scenery. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=160.0s)]
*  It's like the mountains. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=167.0s)]
*  Yeah, I dig it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=169.0s)]
*  We were at the we played the Orange Peel like four or five weeks ago. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=170.0s)]
*  And it felt like a hometown show. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=175.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's awesome. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=177.0s)]
*  That's the stronghold there in the mountains. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=179.0s)]
*  Duncan grew up there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=180.0s)]
*  And he said when he was growing up there, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=181.0s)]
*  there were so many cows that had magic mushrooms in their shit [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=184.0s)]
*  that the farmers started putting some sort of anti-fungal thing in the cows food [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=189.0s)]
*  so that it would repel the fungus from the cow shit. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=195.0s)]
*  I was like, how satanic people people were going out in their meadows, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=199.0s)]
*  trying to trying to harvest those bad boys. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=203.0s)]
*  He said it was everywhere. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=205.0s)]
*  What is this? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=206.0s)]
*  It was up in around April. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=207.0s)]
*  So about a year ago. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=209.0s)]
*  What does this have to do with Epstein? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=210.0s)]
*  That's just the picture that's on the. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=211.0s)]
*  Oh, what are you saying? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=212.0s)]
*  Tourist town Asheville rocked by violence in the wake of defund police movement, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=214.0s)]
*  rolls out plan to combat crime spike. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=218.0s)]
*  Yeah. So there was a big ass crime spike. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=221.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=223.0s)]
*  Yeah. He said it was crazy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=224.0s)]
*  He said, but that's the saddest fucking shit about like small rural communities [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=226.0s)]
*  is when everything dries up, there's nothing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=232.0s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=234.0s)]
*  There's no there's no other jobs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=235.0s)]
*  There's no other place to go. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=237.0s)]
*  There's it's just if you have a small population of humans and they all live together, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=238.0s)]
*  if the industry dries up, a business is shut down. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=243.0s)]
*  If things go under like everyone's fucked, like people are so reliant. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=246.0s)]
*  Yeah, that that's happening in my hometown right now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=250.0s)]
*  What's your hometown? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=253.0s)]
*  Morgantown, West Virginia. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=254.0s)]
*  And it's you know, it it has its ups and downs. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=255.0s)]
*  And right now it's definitely in a bit of a down. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=258.0s)]
*  We had a big pharmaceutical company that was based out of West Virginia called Mylan. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=260.0s)]
*  And the founder passed away a little over a decade ago. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=267.0s)]
*  So then when that happens, you know, it goes into folks that didn't build it themselves. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=272.0s)]
*  And they ended up selling to an Israeli company. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=277.0s)]
*  And once that happened, they shut down those headquarters. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=280.0s)]
*  And Morgantown, where it had always been, I think that was twelve hundred jobs [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=283.0s)]
*  in a town of twenty six thousand people in the city limits. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=288.0s)]
*  So you imagine how many people that affects in the big circle. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=292.0s)]
*  Then covid, which that happened during covid. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=296.0s)]
*  So then you all you all said covid. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=299.0s)]
*  So, you know, our our main street, it's called High Street, is it's like one third closed down. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=301.0s)]
*  And it used to be all open. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=307.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=309.0s)]
*  Did you ever see Roger and me, the documentary? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=310.0s)]
*  So Michael Moore documentary, it's the first one that he did. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=313.0s)]
*  It's his best one, I think. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=316.0s)]
*  And it's about Flint, Michigan. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=317.0s)]
*  And it's about when what happened when the car manufacturers all moved out of the country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=321.0s)]
*  And it's the saddest fucking documentary, man. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=328.0s)]
*  It's just they just up and pulled the factories just so they could make more money, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=331.0s)]
*  having people work for cheaper. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=336.0s)]
*  And the whole town just collapsed, collapsed. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=338.0s)]
*  It's just it's so sad. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=341.0s)]
*  One of the saddest things is there's a lady that has a sign says bunnies for pets or food. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=343.0s)]
*  Damn. Yeah. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=350.0s)]
*  You want to think that like you're committed to selling bunnies as a pet. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=353.0s)]
*  If it's you know, imagine that little puppy we're showing Jamie's getting a puppy, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=358.0s)]
*  French bulldog and Jamie trying to con me into taking one of them and it might have worked. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=362.0s)]
*  I did a dirty trick. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=367.0s)]
*  I said a video of this puppy to all my daughters and my wife. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=368.0s)]
*  So we might have a puppy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=374.0s)]
*  And it's definitely like Jamie knew that was going to happen to know that I waited. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=376.0s)]
*  He didn't know that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=381.0s)]
*  But but the moment I emailed it to the daughters, I was like, they're going to fucking go crazy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=382.0s)]
*  But imagine what's that? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=388.0s)]
*  There it is right there. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=390.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=391.0s)]
*  Bunnies, pets or meat for sale. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=392.0s)]
*  That's something you don't see in the U.S. every day. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=394.0s)]
*  It's a dark, dark. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=396.0s)]
*  Look at her. She's skinning it right there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=398.0s)]
*  Like she's on a loan. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=400.0s)]
*  Yeah. And she kills it right there, too. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=401.0s)]
*  You know, she's holding it and cuddling it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=404.0s)]
*  And then she snaps its fucking neck and cooks it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=406.0s)]
*  It's just you would imagine like those puppies, they're like, Jamie, if they said you could keep this as a pet or you could eat it like. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=409.0s)]
*  Dude, you see it in Flint. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=416.0s)]
*  We play there once a year and our shows are great and the people are great. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=419.0s)]
*  But man, compared I see all the towns across America and that that one's start different. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=422.0s)]
*  They haven't done jack shit to fix that water either. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=430.0s)]
*  I don't think they fixed that water at all. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=433.0s)]
*  Have they? I don't think so. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=435.0s)]
*  Remember when Obama went there? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=437.0s)]
*  That was a long time ago, man. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=438.0s)]
*  That's two presidents ago. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=439.0s)]
*  I remember seeing videos of people, you know, lighting it on fire. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=440.0s)]
*  Well, that is from them. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=444.0s)]
*  That's fracking. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=446.0s)]
*  That's from that movie Gasland. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=447.0s)]
*  And that's that's different. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=450.0s)]
*  Did I get fooled? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=452.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=453.0s)]
*  Well, they might have did it in Flint, too. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=454.0s)]
*  But there are places in the country where you can light your fucking tap water on fire. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=456.0s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=462.0s)]
*  And they say there's been some of that that existed even before fracking. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=463.0s)]
*  It's kind of confusing because you don't know how much the fracking industry is like, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=470.0s)]
*  oh, that's always been here. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=473.0s)]
*  Do not concern yourself with this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=474.0s)]
*  This is no longer an issue. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=477.0s)]
*  This is a little bit of contamination. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=479.0s)]
*  But look at the bright side. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=480.0s)]
*  Yeah, you never know. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=482.0s)]
*  People just take tap water and fuel your car and you use it as a candle. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=483.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can never take, you know, when somebody's business is at stake, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=488.0s)]
*  you got to kind of you got to get some different points of view on those types of things. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=494.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very difficult to know what the fuck is actually going on. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=498.0s)]
*  But overall, it seems like fracking does a lot of fucked up shit. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=501.0s)]
*  It says they've got their lead levels below the federal threshold for like the sixth or seventh year in a row. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=505.0s)]
*  OK, but what does that mean? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=512.0s)]
*  What's the federal? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=513.0s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=514.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=515.0s)]
*  I don't like that term. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=516.0s)]
*  Federal threshold. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=517.0s)]
*  Still in there. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=518.0s)]
*  What I mean, wouldn't it? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=519.0s)]
*  How much would it cost? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=520.0s)]
*  Think about how much money they spent on Ukraine. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=521.0s)]
*  How much would it cost to provide every family in Flint with a filtration system, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=523.0s)]
*  like a real hardcore filtration system that provides them with absolutely clean water? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=530.0s)]
*  I guarantee you wouldn't be one hundred and fucking seventy billion dollars or whatever we've sent over to Ukraine. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=536.0s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be a lot less than that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=541.0s)]
*  A lot less than that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=542.0s)]
*  But not a goddamn thought of it, not a conversation about massive filtration systems. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=544.0s)]
*  Like there's a way to do this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=550.0s)]
*  We've got to provide every family. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=551.0s)]
*  It's a small, it's not that big. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=553.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=555.0s)]
*  There's just over 40,000 households. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=556.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's not that big, man. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=559.0s)]
*  That is not that big. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=561.0s)]
*  A thousand dollars a piece. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=562.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=563.0s)]
*  How much is that? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=564.0s)]
*  I'm just guessing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=565.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=566.0s)]
*  If it was a thousand a piece, that'd be pretty easy. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=567.0s)]
*  I feel like it probably used to be way bigger than that, too. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=568.0s)]
*  I bet. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=571.0s)]
*  You know, that's not much bigger in Morgantown, you know, with all the car industry stuff that used to be there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=572.0s)]
*  It wouldn't surprise me if they had hundreds of thousands. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=577.0s)]
*  I guarantee. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=579.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen videos of Detroit from the 1950s and 60s? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=580.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=584.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Boomtown. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=585.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=586.0s)]
*  Detroit was one of the biggest fucking most wealthy cities in the world. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=587.0s)]
*  In the world. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=594.0s)]
*  And now you've got trees growing through houses because the houses have been abandoned. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=595.0s)]
*  Top Gear, that show, they went there. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=600.0s)]
*  I think it wasn't Top Gear at the time. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=602.0s)]
*  I think it was when they did the other show, did it for Amazon. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=604.0s)]
*  What was that called when they did it to Amazon, when they went over to Amazon? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=607.0s)]
*  The... [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=610.0s)]
*  Oh, I know what you're talking about. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=612.0s)]
*  I forget what it's called. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=614.0s)]
*  I can't remember the name, though. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=615.0s)]
*  But what they did was they bought a house for like $500. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=616.0s)]
*  And you know, they were like hanging out in this house while they were staying there. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=621.0s)]
*  It's like, you get a house for $500? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=626.0s)]
*  I looked into that one time. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=629.0s)]
*  It's a little bit of a loophole. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=630.0s)]
*  When you're buying it for $500, at least the way it was when I read it, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=632.0s)]
*  you're making a commitment to get it up to code within like seven days or something like that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=635.0s)]
*  You have a very limited amount of time. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=639.0s)]
*  Up to what? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=641.0s)]
*  You don't know if you have to, but yeah, so you're spending $60,000 on top of that to get it up to code. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=642.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=646.0s)]
*  Like you're buying it for $500, but you're still making a commitment to fix it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=647.0s)]
*  You get a house for $60,000? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=650.0s)]
*  But I also think Mike Epps just fixed up a whole block of houses, not there, but in Gary, Indiana, and outside of Indy. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=652.0s)]
*  No shit. Shout out to Mike Epps. That's awesome. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=658.0s)]
*  Just like that. Just like he bought a bunch, bought the whole block. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=660.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. That's awesome. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=662.0s)]
*  I heard Detroit has a bunch of manufacturing space. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=664.0s)]
*  It's kind of a good opportunity for somebody if somebody's got something that they want to make. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=668.0s)]
*  It's kind of a good place to go and get after it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=673.0s)]
*  I think the last time we were there, we opened for Zach at one of those theaters there, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=675.0s)]
*  but we were kind of chilling around downtown, and it seems to be a little bit on the up and up in some parts of the downtown. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=681.0s)]
*  They're by the baseball stadium. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=689.0s)]
*  Compared to years past, a while back when I'd been there before, it seemed like maybe it's taking a turn for the better. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=692.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a little bit of a resurgence. There's a resurgence of small businesses being established there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=699.0s)]
*  I know Shinola's out of there. You ever heard of that company, Shinola? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=705.0s)]
*  Yeah, American Watches. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=708.0s)]
*  They make watches. They make a bunch of different stuff, leather goods, cool stuff. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=710.0s)]
*  They make really good messenger bags and that kind of shit. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=714.0s)]
*  They make real cool American-made stuff. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=719.0s)]
*  So that's nice. It's nice that things like that are happening where people do recognize. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=721.0s)]
*  And if you drive down there, there's so much area that is available. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=727.0s)]
*  There's so many buildings that are just completely abandoned and the windows are all shattered and covered with spray paint and graffiti, but the bones are still there. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=730.0s)]
*  If somebody wanted to rebuild it... [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=738.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you got a good idea and want some manufacturing space, that'd be a good spot to go. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=740.0s)]
*  Back in the day, during the car boom, like Canton, Ohio, Detroit, Toledo, Flint, there was a lot of folks from the mountains that were moving up there and getting those jobs. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=745.0s)]
*  I think that was the Hillbilly Highway is where that term comes from. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=759.0s)]
*  My grandparents were one of those. They moved up to Canton, Ohio. My granddad was working for Ford. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=765.0s)]
*  The place where we're from in West Virginia is super country, very rural. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=772.0s)]
*  I think there's 4,000 people in the county now, in Pendleton County. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=777.0s)]
*  There's this local guy, I can't remember his name, but my great-grandparents had an old store where you could go and get your boots and your milk and your eggs and everything in this one little general store. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=782.0s)]
*  It was a hangout too. This guy was coming in the store, he's like, I'm going to Detroit and I'm telling you what, I'm going to get a job headed up there. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=797.0s)]
*  He's talking about it for months and months and then finally he's like, I'm going. He gets in the car and goes. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=805.0s)]
*  Everybody's like, there he goes so and so. Then two weeks later he rolled back into town. He never made it. He couldn't find his way. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=810.0s)]
*  He wasn't able to read a map well enough and just gave up and turned around and ended up coming home after two weeks. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=817.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. Just gave up on that dream. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=826.0s)]
*  Boy, imagine people today trying to use maps. Isn't that funny that being able to read a map kind of went away? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=829.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, not a kid, when I was 20, well first of all when I first started doing stand-up comedy, I would use one of these things, like a legal pad. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=836.0s)]
*  I would get a phone call and they'd go, hey, we've got a gig for you and here's your directions. You got a pen? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=846.0s)]
*  I'm like, okay. You're going to take the 405 to this or that, to the Dine, to the fucking, you're going to take a ride on this road, go two miles down the highway, you're going to find a building. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=853.0s)]
*  Like, wow. That's how we did it. I used to have a folder where I had the directions to all these different road gigs that were written down. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=863.0s)]
*  And that's how I got around. And then when I came to California, I got a Thomas Guide. I was like, wow, I'm in the fucking future. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=873.0s)]
*  You know, I got a whole book of maps and everybody had a Thomas Guide. And I remember the first time Bill Burr visited my house. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=881.0s)]
*  He had a Thomas Guide. He figured out how to get to my house with the Thomas Guide. I gave him the address and he showed up with a fucking map book on his front seat. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=889.0s)]
*  Unreal. Those are different. Now, you know, when I was a little kid and on our family vacations, my brother, my older brother would be like, he would read the map and give the directions to usually my dad was driving. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=899.0s)]
*  But yeah, by the time I started working, you know, thank God for that GPS. I can't imagine doing that. Like, trying to find my way because hell, I mean. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=913.0s)]
*  First time I had GPS, it was like 98 something like that. 98 or 99. I had it was like a CD-ROM that you stuck in the CD player had a little flip up screen. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=923.0s)]
*  I thought like this is the shit. I had an Acura NSX and the little screen would pop up and you put in the CD and it was only for Los Angeles. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=939.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it was real slow, real slow and shitty. But I was like, dude, I'm in a James Bond movie. Yeah, 98. That's some top shit right there. Mission Impossible. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=948.0s)]
*  Look at this. I'm fucking following the directions on. I had a little thing that sat on the roof that was like the GPS thing that would like read the sky. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=956.0s)]
*  And then it would somehow or another communicate with this map that was on my my screen. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=965.0s)]
*  Damn. Yeah. Did you ever miss gigs back in the map days when you're, you know, I was pretty good at it and pretty good at it. Yeah, I was pretty good at it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=971.0s)]
*  And they were they were pretty good at giving solid directions to retarded comedians. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=978.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. It's like reading that map and the type of folks that are comedians and musicians or, you know, are we're not the most capable. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=983.0s)]
*  We're real similar. Musicians and comedians always seem to like get along real good. We have like real similar sort of just sensibilities. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=991.0s)]
*  Yeah. Dealing with a lot of clowny shit, a lot of clowny shit, a lot of fucking irresponsible, impulsive people, a lot of substances, a lot of a lot of chaos, a lot of fun, a lot of rebels. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1001.0s)]
*  You know, you don't pursue that dream if you've got, you know, a law degree and, you know, a future with the firm and, you know, everything's lined up and you got your 401k. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1014.0s)]
*  I was like, you gotta be a wild person. You gotta have a screw loose. A hundred percent somewhere. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1027.0s)]
*  There's got to be a screw loose or, you know, there's some there's some major some major issue, whether they express it or not. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1033.0s)]
*  But that's how the great stuff comes. Like look at Jelly Roll. How do you you don't get a Jelly Roll with with a guy who's had like a perfect education and a well rounded lifestyle. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1041.0s)]
*  You don't get that beautiful, amazing, soulful music and that incredible human being. You don't get that. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1053.0s)]
*  And I don't know him, but, you know, just listening to him talk, I don't think even 15 years ago, Jelly Roll could be who he is now. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1061.0s)]
*  Right. If it would have happened earlier, because he kind of jokes about, you know, like best new. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1072.0s)]
*  He got the best new artist of the year and he's like 39 or whatever. And he was kind of joking about that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1076.0s)]
*  But, you know, for him, the time that is the right time for him. Yeah. And, you know, it's just. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1081.0s)]
*  Yeah, it all aligned perfectly where a guy like Jelly Roll, especially in country. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1088.0s)]
*  Right. We see a guy like Jelly Roll with face tattoos and like gold teeth and shit like what? Yeah. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1093.0s)]
*  That guy 20 years ago, you never, you never see that. But, you know, times are different in a good way and a lot of good ways. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1100.0s)]
*  A lot of great ways in all music and art in general. It's like these communities are sort of colliding with each other. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1107.0s)]
*  And you're getting these sort of interesting mixtures of people. Yeah. You got Post Malone. Yeah. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1114.0s)]
*  Same country music. Exactly. Covering Sergel Simpson and stuff like that. And it's like, fuck yeah. Exactly. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1120.0s)]
*  Exactly. I watched his, sorry, the NPR Tiny Desk concert. I didn't see that. It's amazing. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1125.0s)]
*  Dude, it's amazing. Did you see Scarface's? No. Oh, my God. It's incredible. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1132.0s)]
*  Incredible. Scarface from the Ghetto Boys. No, I didn't see his. Did a Tiny Desk concert. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1136.0s)]
*  Fucking amazing. Amazing. Just like he did it. He altered the music to fit the vibe of this Tiny Desk thing. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1141.0s)]
*  Are you a Ghetto Boys fan? No, I didn't listen to him much. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1152.0s)]
*  Dude, when I was a kid, Ghetto Boys was shit. When I delivered newspapers, I used to deliver newspapers. I'd drive around listening to Ghetto Boys. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1156.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. He was on here before talking about playing to half a million people. Was that one or was that somebody else? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1163.0s)]
*  No, no, no. That was Be Real. That was Be Real from Cyprus. I remember hearing that. I'll never forget that when he was telling that story. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1171.0s)]
*  A half million people at a music festival. That was Woodstock. Yeah, half a million people. Someone stole his shoes. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1177.0s)]
*  He was crowd surfing. Someone stole his sneakers off him. When you're playing to half a million people and you lose your shoes, whatever. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1184.0s)]
*  That's the price you pay for just getting to experience something. God, that's kind of crazy. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1192.0s)]
*  How many people have ever experienced that in their life? I know, right? That's got to be nuts, man. That's got to be nuts. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1197.0s)]
*  This is something nuts about just enormous crowds, but enormous crowds vibing to your music. It has to be crazy. That has to be really, that has to be so surreal. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1204.0s)]
*  There was a video that my bandmates were showing me from, I think it was like that 90s Woodstock. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1216.0s)]
*  It might have been the same one, maybe a different day, but it was like Metallica or Korn. I think it was Korn. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1226.0s)]
*  And that sea of people, it looks like a sea with all of them jumping up and down. Oh, wow. And the video is profound. It was incredible. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1235.0s)]
*  I don't know how, I can't believe nobody died in that with all those people moving. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1247.0s)]
*  But Dave Chappelle and I did the Tacoma Dome once in, that's so crazy. Oh my God, it does look like water. Wow. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1252.0s)]
*  Look at that. Wow. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1263.0s)]
*  By the way, that's a really good way to get brain damage. I never used to think of that until I talked to my friend Mark Gordon, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1267.0s)]
*  who's an expert in traumatic brain injuries. And he's like, yeah, you're not supposed to be bouncing your head around like that. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1279.0s)]
*  I gotta stop doing that. I do that in my shows. I need to stop doing that. I think it legitimately gives you brain damage. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1287.0s)]
*  I'll start getting punchy and I never fought. Yeah, soccer players get it, man. Soccer players get CTE from hitting the ball. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1294.0s)]
*  A soft ass ball bouncing it off your head over and over again will give you brain damage. Yeah. Jet skiers, you get it from jet skis. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1300.0s)]
*  Bouncing on waves all the time. Bang, bang, bang. You get brain damage that way, which is nuts. Hard to believe. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1307.0s)]
*  I need to start rethinking my live show a little bit. I do that a little too much. It's not like, you know, I just feel it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1314.0s)]
*  But yeah, maybe I ought to stop doing that. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1321.0s)]
*  What I was going to say about Dave Chappelle and I, we did the Tacoma Dome, which is 25,000 people in Tacoma, Washington. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1323.0s)]
*  And we sold out the Tacoma Dome and it was like the highest, we broke the attendance record and we're backstage and the crowd is just nuts. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1330.0s)]
*  And Dave's sitting there with a cigarette and he looks at me and he goes, not a whole lot of motherfuckers get to do this. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1340.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The percentages of people that ever get to experience that. No, it's so small. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1346.0s)]
*  And you guys do it with just a microphone. That's that's great. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1352.0s)]
*  Like, damn, I'm one of the least funny people you ever meet. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1355.0s)]
*  So like seeing folks that can play in arena just because of your jokes and shit like and your ability to tell a story and the timing and the punch line. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1358.0s)]
*  That's a that's something I can never do. Never, ever do. I have none of that. No talent for that at all. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1368.0s)]
*  It's a thing that you either want to do and have to learn how to do it or you don't. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1374.0s)]
*  But it's not it's not outside of there's a lot of funny people. They just don't do it. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1380.0s)]
*  It's not a thing that it's but it's a long journey. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1387.0s)]
*  Like to get good at stand up, it takes like 10 years, takes 10 solid years of constantly performing. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1393.0s)]
*  And every comic will look at a comic like you did, like someone tell you, like, how long has he been doing it? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1399.0s)]
*  Two years like, all right, see in eight years like this, like a thing like everybody looks at comics that haven't been doing it any more than 10 years. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1404.0s)]
*  And how good is he? You know, what's he got? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1413.0s)]
*  They got a good solid 15 minutes like what does he fold up when you know, like what's his bits like? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1417.0s)]
*  Do they have any depth to them? What's the timing like? Is there any misdirection? Is there any like what is the what's the level that they're at? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1424.0s)]
*  It takes so long. It takes so long. But it's not like singing like you can either sing or you can't sing. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1433.0s)]
*  You know, like you have a God given voice. Like there's people that just can fucking sing, man. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1440.0s)]
*  They can sing like they just have this quality to their voice and they're just born with it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1445.0s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. I don't have that. Yeah. Whatever that is. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1452.0s)]
*  That's the whole reason I can do what I'm doing, because I didn't pick up a guitar until I was 20. Really? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1456.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I got a late start and, you know, I'm not a great guitar player. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1461.0s)]
*  I'm still very much like an intermediate guitar player. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1465.0s)]
*  But, you know, I was fortunate enough to and I didn't grow up singing. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1468.0s)]
*  So I just found out that I could sing in my early 20s and then realized you find out what what what were you doing before? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1473.0s)]
*  What were you doing before you started doing music? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1481.0s)]
*  So I was at West Virginia University and I wanted to play football, but I wasn't good enough. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1483.0s)]
*  That I had no God given talent to be good enough. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1487.0s)]
*  And when you want something really bad, you know, that was like my my first dream that died, you know. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1490.0s)]
*  And once I let that go, I had all this free time. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1496.0s)]
*  And I was like, I need to because I've always hunted and fish. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1500.0s)]
*  But when you're going to the class every day, you can't always I need more things to fill my time up. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1504.0s)]
*  So I was watching the Grammys in 2011 and the Averett brothers played and then they played with with Bob Dylan and Mumford and Sons. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1509.0s)]
*  And I just remember watching them being like, man, that that's incredible. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1517.0s)]
*  Maybe I should pick a guitar up. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1521.0s)]
*  That'd be something I can do productive in the evening. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1523.0s)]
*  So that's how I got started. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1526.0s)]
*  And then it was about a year later in 2012 when I actually could like string some chords together and then I started singing. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1528.0s)]
*  And then I started figuring it out. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1534.0s)]
*  So you initially just started doing it just for fun. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1536.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. It was just going to be just another like just something to get into and and, you know, something a productive hobby. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1539.0s)]
*  You know, I was just kind of looking for some more things because since I gave up trying to play football, it just wasn't going to happen. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1547.0s)]
*  You know, all that time I used to spend working out and trying to make that happen. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1556.0s)]
*  And it became free time because, you know, so I just had to try to fill that time up with something because I just didn't want to sit around and and bullshit with my friends all the time. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1560.0s)]
*  And, you know, so that's how I got into it. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1572.0s)]
*  Was there a thing that made you realize that you could do this professionally? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1574.0s)]
*  Was there a moment we figured it out? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1578.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. I got I had a very unique first gig. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1580.0s)]
*  So I was on the Sprout, the Promise Scholarship at West Virginia. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1585.0s)]
*  And that was this thing for in-state kids. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1591.0s)]
*  If you had good grades, you'd go to school for free at an in-state university. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1593.0s)]
*  So I was at WVU going to school for free because of my grades and they had a study abroad program. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1599.0s)]
*  And my junior year, I was like, I've never been overseas. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1606.0s)]
*  I was like, that would be I'd like to experience that. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1610.0s)]
*  So I went in to the counselor's office and they kind of laid out some different options. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1614.0s)]
*  And I got a finance degree at WVU and there were four places I could go. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1619.0s)]
*  There's Hertfordshire, England, Bamberg, Germany, Tartu, Estonia and Hong Kong. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1624.0s)]
*  So they kind of like were telling me all about the different schools. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1630.0s)]
*  I ended up landing on Tartu, Estonia as the place to go to. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1634.0s)]
*  So I went over there and had brought my guitar and I just continued practicing a little bit in the evenings just for fun. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1638.0s)]
*  But I had six flatmates. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1647.0s)]
*  So there was no way that I could go anywhere and not be heard by them, you know, in our place. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1648.0s)]
*  So I was a little uncomfortable with that because I wouldn't used to people listen to me at all or sing in front of anybody. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1654.0s)]
*  But I didn't want to like not play the guitar for half a year. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1661.0s)]
*  So I kept doing it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1666.0s)]
*  And then when I was over there, we went to a show and one night there in Tartu and there's this club. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1668.0s)]
*  It's like a little like hundred and fifty cap room, maybe two hundred. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1676.0s)]
*  And we go to the show and one of my roommates after I left had taken my guitar. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1681.0s)]
*  And after the show was done, he ran up on stage and for some reason the mic was still on. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1687.0s)]
*  His name was Balam and he ran up there and said, Charlie, come play a song. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1691.0s)]
*  I was like, no, no way. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1695.0s)]
*  And then he got the room to start chanting, Charlie, Charlie. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1698.0s)]
*  And then I'm like kind of calculating my head, the pros and cons of like bitching out or just falling through. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1704.0s)]
*  And I was like, at this point, it'd be way worse if I bitched out and didn't go up and play one. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1710.0s)]
*  So I went up and played like a song. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1714.0s)]
*  Was it an original song? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1716.0s)]
*  No, no, I hadn't started writing then. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1717.0s)]
*  I didn't have any aspirations yet to do to do this professionally. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1719.0s)]
*  What song did you play? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1723.0s)]
*  Probably Country Roads. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1724.0s)]
*  I probably only knew like six songs. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1726.0s)]
*  And I was like shaking in my jeans. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1728.0s)]
*  Just so nervous. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1732.0s)]
*  But I got through it and then I got a Facebook message. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1734.0s)]
*  The next that was a Friday. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1737.0s)]
*  So on Monday, I got a Facebook message from a fashion designer there in town. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1738.0s)]
*  And she asked if I could play for her fashion show that Friday. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1742.0s)]
*  And I said, yeah, sure. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1746.0s)]
*  Hell, yeah. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1748.0s)]
*  She goes, can you fill 20 minutes? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1749.0s)]
*  I'm like, I can fill 20 minutes. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1750.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1752.0s)]
*  So I showed up and it was at this. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1753.0s)]
*  It's like this this cafe with like one of those courtyards in the middle of the building. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1755.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? You ever been in a place like that and had these two French doors? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1760.0s)]
*  And they had the sound all hooked up and a couple of my American buddies that were over there with me came with me. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1765.0s)]
*  And they got me set up. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1771.0s)]
*  And then it ended up being a lingerie fashion show. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1772.0s)]
*  So I got this right here. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1775.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1777.0s)]
*  Oh, Jamie found it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1778.0s)]
*  Oh, shit, Jamie. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1780.0s)]
*  Don't embarrass me. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1781.0s)]
*  You're playing. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1782.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1783.0s)]
*  By the way, this is a song you could fucking never write today. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1789.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1793.0s)]
*  Hey, little girl, is your daddy home? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1794.0s)]
*  Did he go and leave you all alone? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1796.0s)]
*  Different times. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1798.0s)]
*  I got a bad desire. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1799.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm on fire. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1801.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1802.0s)]
*  So that's my first gig. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1805.0s)]
*  I made 150 euro. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1806.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1807.0s)]
*  And as they go in and out, they come out with less clothes on each time. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1808.0s)]
*  What a strange gig. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1813.0s)]
*  A lingerie fashion show. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1816.0s)]
*  There's little kids there. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1818.0s)]
*  People are hanging out. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1820.0s)]
*  Fashion shows are so strange. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1821.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1823.0s)]
*  They're so strange. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1824.0s)]
*  So I made 150 euro for doing those 20 minutes. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1825.0s)]
*  And I was like, this is the easiest work I've ever done in my life. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1829.0s)]
*  I'm going to keep doing this. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1833.0s)]
*  So when I came back to West Virginia, I started singing bluegrass music at WVU [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1835.0s)]
*  and bars and stuff around town and the state. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1839.0s)]
*  Did you get any more gigs while you were in Estonia? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1841.0s)]
*  I think I did. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1843.0s)]
*  I think if I remember right, I might have played at that cafe a couple more times, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1844.0s)]
*  maybe, max. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1847.0s)]
*  But it was really when I came back to West Virginia where I started like really gigging. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1848.0s)]
*  So that gig that we saw right there, that gig was the thing that started the spark. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1853.0s)]
*  It started, yeah. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1858.0s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1859.0s)]
*  It was 2013. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1860.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1862.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1863.0s)]
*  June 17th, 2013. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1867.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1868.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1871.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1872.0s)]
*  And that's how it began. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1873.0s)]
*  And I sucked because I just picked up the guitar. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1875.0s)]
*  And I was just a beginner in the whole business. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1881.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to do this. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1884.0s)]
*  And I was just a beginner in the whole business. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1886.0s)]
*  And it took until 2017. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1889.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1893.0s)]
*  More stunning videos. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1894.0s)]
*  Oh, Jamie, you're embarrassing me now, bud. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1895.0s)]
*  You're going to make me blush. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1897.0s)]
*  No. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1899.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1901.0s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1913.0s)]
*  This is great. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1914.0s)]
*  It's like if you were watching yourself at an open mic. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1915.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1918.0s)]
*  I've seen those videos. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1919.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1921.0s)]
*  So it took me until 2017, 2018 to find my voice. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1922.0s)]
*  When did you start writing your own original songs? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1927.0s)]
*  2014. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1930.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1932.0s)]
*  So after your first gigs. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1933.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1934.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1935.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1936.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1937.0s)]
*  I was playing covers and singing like bluegrass and stuff. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1938.0s)]
*  Had you had any ideas about writing songs? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1940.0s)]
*  Had you ever written any lyrics or had any lyrics in your head or anything like that? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1943.0s)]
*  I started trying to do it when I really made the decision that I wanted to do this. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1947.0s)]
*  And I was like, well, you can't do it without writing your own music. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1951.0s)]
*  So then I started doing that. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1956.0s)]
*  And that was really bad for a long time. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1958.0s)]
*  Do you remember what your first song was that you wrote? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1961.0s)]
*  I can't remember what the first one would have been. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1964.0s)]
*  I remember the third one because the third one wasn't terrible. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1966.0s)]
*  And it was actually one that I put it on the new album for, you know, just kind of I thought it'd be cool to put it on there. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1970.0s)]
*  That is cool. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1980.0s)]
*  Soul like mine. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1981.0s)]
*  But yeah, most of them were really bad and started working on it and figuring it out. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1982.0s)]
*  What is your writing process? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1988.0s)]
*  Do you sit with a notebook? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1990.0s)]
*  Do you just start playing the guitar and start singing? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1991.0s)]
*  How do you do it? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1994.0s)]
*  Yeah, sit with the notebook and that voice voice memo. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1995.0s)]
*  And then when I'm out and about, though, that notes and voice memo app, I have them separate on my phone and I'll jot down ideas, how melodies into it. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=1999.0s)]
*  And I try to stay pretty consistent with it and show up every day and put some put some thought into it in front of the notebook to get my stuff. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2008.0s)]
*  And so do you wait for inspiration to come to you or just sit down? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2017.0s)]
*  No, I'll sit down even if I got nothing, just because if I do that, then I'll find myself maybe going a whole month with without, you know, years ago I listened to Jason Isbell was given kind of some advice on it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2022.0s)]
*  And he said, you know, treat it treat it like a job, like consistent show up to the notebook consistently show up every day, even when you're not inspired. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2037.0s)]
*  And that'll kind of like making your own luck, so to speak. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2046.0s)]
*  Have you ever read Stephen Pressfield's The War of Art? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2051.0s)]
*  I did. Yeah. Yeah, I read that I think last year the year before. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2054.0s)]
*  He sent us a box of those. If you want one. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2059.0s)]
*  A signed copy. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2062.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2063.0s)]
*  He sent us a box of signed. I think I probably sold more of those books for him than anybody alive. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2064.0s)]
*  It's a great book. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2069.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2070.0s)]
*  I don't remember who recommended it to me. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2071.0s)]
*  It was one of the best books in terms of like a practical guide to creativity, because you really genuinely have to treat it like you like he considers it the muse like there is a muse and you contact this muse. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2073.0s)]
*  And if you do it deliberately and you do it with respect and you do it every day. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2092.0s)]
*  Those ideas will come. And they do. They really do come like it's a muse. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2098.0s)]
*  Like I think there's a reason why. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2103.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you don't. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2106.0s)]
*  For me, if I don't show up to the notebook and put my time in and come up with a bunch of junk. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2108.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2114.0s)]
*  I don't think I would have as many of the days where a beautiful line or a melody would just pop into my head. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2115.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2122.0s)]
*  You're just kind of laying. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2123.0s)]
*  You're like paving the way for those this more of those sparks. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2125.0s)]
*  That's the same with comedy. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2129.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's the same with literature. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2130.0s)]
*  It's the same. I think it's the same with everything. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2132.0s)]
*  Do you know the term museum comes from the term use? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2134.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it's from. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2137.0s)]
*  I had no idea what a museum is, is a place where the muse is creations can be exhibited. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2138.0s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2144.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild? I just found that out recently. But it makes sense. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2145.0s)]
*  And there's quite a few words apparently that come from the origin of the idea of the muse. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2148.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2154.0s)]
*  But that's what a museum is. Make sure that's true. I'm pretty sure it's true. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2155.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's true. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2158.0s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2160.0s)]
*  Totally makes sense. I mean museum. What does it say? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2161.0s)]
*  The Greek form museum meant the seat of the muses, a designated philosophical institution or place of contemplation. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2164.0s)]
*  But it makes sense. You address the muse, the muse gives you these ideas. You create these things and you exhibit them. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2172.0s)]
*  Yeah. We were driving down from Dallas this morning listening to Willie Nelson's autobiography. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2180.0s)]
*  And he was talking about almost being like a mouthpiece for the gods. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2189.0s)]
*  Like he was saying that all the songs, there's something, I'm paraphrasing, but it was like something along the lines like all the music that he's ever written was in him before he was born. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2194.0s)]
*  And it was just, you know, his task was to just connect with that. Like what was already inside of him. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2203.0s)]
*  He was saying that his grandmother like told him that all that music inside of him was given by God. It was an interesting idea on it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2212.0s)]
*  It's a good way to look at it. If you just think that there's an endless well of inspiration and creativity that's inside you. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2221.0s)]
*  That God gave you this thing and you just got to just keep working and get it out of you and then give it out to people. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2231.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that train of thought helps you when you go, when you're in a rut. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2239.0s)]
*  If you tell yourself this is what I'm put here to do. This is what I'm meant to do. So I'm going to do it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2243.0s)]
*  And I found myself in 2022. That was me. I was in a rut because just a lot of circumstances in my life and in my work life had new things in it, new pressure. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2248.0s)]
*  That I was having a hard time writing because before I'd just been so free and didn't have people depending on me and all kinds of expectations. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2265.0s)]
*  And just being reminded by my father-in-law about, you know, this is what you're put on this earth to do. This is what you do best. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2274.0s)]
*  This is what got you to the show in the first place. Just do that. Don't worry about all the other stuff you can't control. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2281.0s)]
*  There's a lot of that with creative peoples is this a sort of wrestling match in your mind about, you know, anxieties, what you desire, what you hope to happen. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2287.0s)]
*  You know, where is it going? What's the future? How's it all going to unfold? Do I have my run dry? Do I have any more songs left inside of me? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2301.0s)]
*  Yeah. Am I going to lose it all? Yeah. Am I going to just start sucking? Am I going to fall off? Is nobody going to like me anymore? That's a big one. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2311.0s)]
*  And that was happening to me. Yeah. And it was February 22. We got off tour and labels started coming into the picture for the first time. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2319.0s)]
*  Before that, I never had to worry about that. And then I had a band that was dependent upon me and they'd given up their jobs like they'd gone all in. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2329.0s)]
*  So they have, you know, their livelihoods were dependent upon it. And it was it was it took me a lot of work to to shake all that off and get back to like that that like clean slate of mind of just writing because I love doing it. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2338.0s)]
*  And that's what I put here to do. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2354.0s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah, that that if you can have like a mindset that you could call upon, like an understanding or calling that's in your mind that you know, like no matter how much confusion there is, no matter how much doubt, things go sideways. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2357.0s)]
*  If you're not real sure, just stay on the path to stay on that path. And then you'll have those dark moments. Then you come out of it. And you're like, oh, I'm all right again. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2375.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And once you've gone through something like that, it makes you a lot better on the other end because when you see it again, you know, I know what this is. Yeah. I'm just going to keep working right through it. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2386.0s)]
*  We'll be fine. We're going to be just just fine. That's why I like heartache for teenagers is the hardest thing ever. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2396.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you get dumped when you're 15, you're like, the world is over. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2403.0s)]
*  It's devastating. Yeah, it's fucking devastating. If I could go back and talk to myself as a teenage. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2410.0s)]
*  Oh my God, I have so much advice. Yeah, I would have so much advice, but I wouldn't listen anyway. My young me was an idiot. He wouldn't have listened. Yeah. I don't like, dude, you're going to be fine. No, I have to marry her. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2419.0s)]
*  She's the one for me. I'm lost without her. You fucking idiot. You just listen to too many stupid songs. You're fine. Yeah. Yeah. Life is life. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2432.0s)]
*  You know, life is short, but it's also pretty long. And sometimes young folks, they lose sight of, you know, just how much time there is ahead of them for who knows what's going to come come their way. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2441.0s)]
*  There's a song lyric in that life is short, but it's also pretty long because that is 100% true. Yeah, definitely. Good theme for a song there. Yeah, life is short. It really is very short, but it is fucking long. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2452.0s)]
*  It's the learning process is long. It's long. Just figure out life. It's a sludge. Every day, every day. It's just like a little more information creeps in and gets sort of like accepted. Yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2466.0s)]
*  Yeah. Written in. I get it now. Okay. Now I fucking now. I really get it. Now I get it. Get it. Yeah. And then there's some other little little aspect of life that comes around the next year and you learn the hard way on that one. Oh shit. I didn't see that one coming. Yep. Yeah. Boy, that's one of the things that is positive and negative about things like COVID. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2486.0s)]
*  You know, like some major upheaval of everything or the whole world just gets thrown sideways. You're like, Whoa, the negative. I mean, there's so many negatives, right? Loss of life, loss of businesses, everybody fucking at each other's throats. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2508.0s)]
*  But on the other side of it and the other end of it, you're like, Oh, now I kind of understand people a little bit better. Now I understand why character and discipline is so important in friends and people that you love. People that can hang in there and deal with things versus people that cannot adapt and just fall apart and then look for someone to rescue them. Yeah. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2523.0s)]
*  And these these things, you only learn them. There's only one way to learn them. You have to go through some shit. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. If you were to if you were to ask me in 2019, how was I going to get through and react to what ended up happening there in 2020? You know, I would have been bullshitting you if I pretended like I knew, you know, my wife and I, we had no idea until until we went through it. Me too. Yeah. I've always had in my head this thought that things could go sideways and that I literally had to go through it. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2548.0s)]
*  I had an apocalypse truck built. I had a Toyota Land Cruiser built with a giant gas tank and all steel bumpers and some like if something gets fucked up, I want something that holds a lot of gas that can go real far and I can drive over hills. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2578.0s)]
*  Did you get like that that you in like bulletproof plating? I didn't. I didn't. Because I figure like if it gets to that, you're kind of fucked. If you're in a goddamn gunfight and you've got rubber tires like you're kind of fucked no matter what. Dude, this is a side note. Not to go too much to the side. But I saw a wild video the other day of these two like armor truck guards in South Africa. Oh, I've seen that. Did you see that? Yeah, that's wild. They're trying to take over this guy's armor. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2594.44s)]
*  Truck and that how those were those dudes at keeping their shit together. They kept it together and you could and you know, it was so rare about that video is like it's just a stable camera on them where you're watching somebody like trying to keep it together and keeping it together. Yeah. But that this is it right there. Yeah. This is they've already got the bullet in the glass. You know, the driver he's he's already fighting, you know, in his way. And then you got his passenger there. Now he's like, all right, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2624.44s)]
*  like you can see it on his face. He's like getting ready to go. Yeah. Wow. And that is a crazy video that that truck ends up coming on the passenger side and shooting some more on that one trying to ram the truck. Yeah. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2654.44s)]
*  Yeah, these guys are trying to take over this armored truck. South Africa is wild. I was looking at this house that's for sale. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2673.76s)]
*  I was just looking. I just enjoy looking at architecture videos for whatever reason. It's not looking to buy a fucking house in South Africa. But they had this house that's for sale in South Africa in Cape Town. And it's called the Iron Man House. And this house is insane. It's one of the coolest fucking houses I've ever seen in my life. It's insane. It's like Tony Stark's house. Oh, yeah. So on a cliff like they built this house that I mean, I think it's like 20 years old. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2684.44s)]
*  20 million dollars, which is insane in Cape Town, South Africa. You know, and it's just overlooking this thing. But Cape Town is so riddled with crime. Like to have a house like that in Cape Town, you're like, like, hey, here's where the money is. Look at that. Oh, my God. Bro. Is that the sickest fucking house you've ever seen in your life? It's insane. It's so sick. And it's like overlooking this water. That does look like the Tony Stark house, too. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2714.44s)]
*  It looks better than Tony Stark because the Tony Stark house is all just CGI. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2743.84s)]
*  This is real. Does it come with that hot lady? This hot lady in her underwear is peering at all these pictures like you can have her. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2747.6s)]
*  It's a good way to sell it. Yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2753.84s)]
*  She's in every picture. And then she would be here drinking, waiting for you. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2755.2400000000002s)]
*  And then she'd be in her underwear waiting for you to fuck. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2758.88s)]
*  Look at this video. Look at these photos, man. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2762.04s)]
*  It's fucking incredible house. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2765.28s)]
*  But that that part of the world is a wild part of the world. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2767.48s)]
*  I mean, this was just in the British Virgin Islands. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2771.64s)]
*  And one of the people that I was with this lady was from South Africa. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2776.3599999999997s)]
*  And she was explaining to us what it's like there. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2780.24s)]
*  And she's like, you know, she's like, you know, my generation, it wasn't that bad. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2781.8399999999997s)]
*  But now it's pretty bad. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2785.8399999999997s)]
*  It's worse now. Yeah. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2787.8399999999997s)]
*  She's like, the violence is just crazy. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2789.6s)]
*  Damn. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2791.96s)]
*  I. Some country music people tour there. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2793.48s)]
*  Really? They do. They do. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2797.6s)]
*  South Africa. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2798.48s)]
*  Kip Moore was there over the summer. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2799.76s)]
*  And I mean, it looked incredible for him. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2801.32s)]
*  But I don't know if I ever find my way there or not. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2805.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like the elevated levels of I guess if you live there, you just get accustomed to it. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2808.8s)]
*  People get accustomed to everything. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2812.64s)]
*  But there's elevated levels of risk there that just don't exist if you're in Austin. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2814.0s)]
*  Yeah. But not necessarily because Sixth Street, where my club is, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2818.64s)]
*  is some fucking shootings there on a regular. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2824.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, yeah, we we played a [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2827.48s)]
*  I was opening for a show at all that like Blues Club downtown back. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2831.28s)]
*  It was like during Antones. Yeah, that's right. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2836.96s)]
*  And there was a shooting that night and ended up being a shooting that night. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2839.8s)]
*  Yeah, it happens. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2842.88s)]
*  Like in America. Well, shit in the world. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2844.6400000000003s)]
*  You're going to have violence, especially it seems like post covid. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2848.76s)]
*  Everything just got kind of like norms sort of dissolved reality, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2853.4s)]
*  sort of shifted into this new strange place where things get there. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2859.2799999999997s)]
*  More heightened tensions and things are more bizarre, I think, than ever before. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2863.4s)]
*  And I think you just get accustomed to that. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2868.44s)]
*  And if you live in South Africa, I guess you just get accustomed to life in that. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2870.32s)]
*  That vibe. Just dealing with that shit. Yeah. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2875.0s)]
*  The people there, they all have like barbed wire all over their fences and shit. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2877.72s)]
*  I can't even imagine high security systems. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2882.88s)]
*  I mean, I would imagine everybody has to be armed. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2885.48s)]
*  Also, when you kill somebody, you get out of jail pretty fucking quick. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2887.28s)]
*  That post-aureus guy. Dude, I saw that. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2891.8s)]
*  He's already out. Damn. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2894.2000000000003s)]
*  That was murdered his fucking girlfriend in like 2013, man. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2896.04s)]
*  Yeah. If I were her dad, I'd be done. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2901.2000000000003s)]
*  How what year did he kill his girlfriend? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2903.76s)]
*  2012. Dude, it was like 10 years ago. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2905.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think he did 11 years. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2908.8s)]
*  It says 9 years. 9 years. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2911.0s)]
*  He did 9 years for murder. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2913.6800000000003s)]
*  Dude, I got... For fucking murder? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2915.6800000000003s)]

*  an armed robbery when they're 16 or 17, you know. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2920.92s)]
*  How about dudes who are selling weed or still in jail for the rest of their life? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2923.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's one of the cruelest things about Colorado. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2926.6s)]
*  When Colorado changed over and became legal and marijuana was legal [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2930.76s)]
*  and Colorado was the first state. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2935.56s)]
*  There's dudes in penitentiaries that could look out their fucking window [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2937.1600000000003s)]
*  and see a weed store. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2940.84s)]
*  That's... They're in jail for selling weed. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2942.04s)]
*  That's a damn shame, isn't it? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2945.96s)]
*  A parole board granted Pistorius's petition in November [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2947.56s)]
*  on the grounds that he had served half of his 13 year sentence [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2951.36s)]
*  for murder in Steenkamp, making him eligible according to South African law. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2954.52s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2959.28s)]
*  If all you have to do is 13 years for killing people. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2961.28s)]
*  Boy, there's a lot of people that are out there like, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2965.2000000000003s)]
*  I think I'd kill that dude now. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2967.6000000000004s)]
*  I'll do 13 years and get him off the fucking planet. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2969.56s)]
*  There's a lot of people like in him out there wandering around. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2971.88s)]
*  How many people out there like that's your daughter? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2975.96s)]
*  That guy killed your daughter and he only did nine years. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2978.56s)]
*  It'd be a no brainer. Look at her. She's so beautiful. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2981.36s)]
*  Yeah, but, you know, I mean, what the fuck, dude? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2984.56s)]
*  He still says he's innocent. Yeah, he shot her. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2988.52s)]
*  Look, he shot through a fucking door and killed her. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2992.56s)]
*  You know, at the very least, he's guilty of reckless manslaughter. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=2997.8s)]
*  Like what you you don't know what your target is. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3003.8s)]
*  You're shooting through a fucking bathroom door or whatever he's doing. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3006.2s)]
*  OK, yeah, I didn't know if my I wasn't like relying on my memory too much. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3009.12s)]
*  But it was a bathroom, too. I believe so. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3012.84s)]
*  Like who the fuck is an armed robber is in the bathroom. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3015.4s)]
*  Was he in the bathroom or was she in the bathroom? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3018.56s)]
*  Was he shooting out of the bathroom? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3020.48s)]
*  I don't remember. I felt like I thought he was in the bathroom. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3022.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm kind of remembering. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3024.72s)]
*  I was worried about something else. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3026.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, one thing you have to take into consideration [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3028.08s)]
*  if there's a lot of break ins, there's a lot of home invasions in an area. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3032.64s)]
*  Look, we're my friends in L.A. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3036.72s)]
*  are telling me like I have friends in L.A. who used to be anti gun. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3039.16s)]
*  And they say, why do you want guns? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3043.12s)]
*  And now they all have guns and they all they're all terrified. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3044.72s)]
*  And there's not all of them, but there's quite a few of them [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3048.6s)]
*  that have experienced break ins. Yeah. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3051.32s)]
*  And one of my friends just moved to Portugal. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3053.0s)]
*  He's just like, there's so much shit going down in L.A. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3055.6s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3058.28s)]
*  And I was telling him, hey, you moved to Austin. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3058.8s)]
*  And then I hadn't talked to him for like six months. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3060.68s)]
*  And I sent him a text message the other day because he loves Korean food. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3062.76s)]
*  I go, bro, I found a dope Korean food spot in Austin. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3065.2s)]
*  He goes, hey, man, I moved to Portugal. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3067.56s)]
*  I was like, what? He's an artist, crazy dude. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3069.56s)]
*  Hell of a move. I was like, what did you do? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3071.84s)]
*  You moved to Portugal. It's amazing here. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3074.44s)]
*  The food's incredible. People are so nice. Crimes low. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3076.7200000000003s)]
*  I have heard that in Portugal is doing. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3079.56s)]
*  Portugal is doing the thing where everything is legal. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3081.52s)]
*  Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3083.8s)]
*  They decriminalize everything. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3084.84s)]
*  All drugs. They experience a giant drop in [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3086.84s)]
*  and murders, a giant drop in addictions and in crime. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3090.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3095.12s)]
*  Look, you're not supposed to have things that people want to do illegal. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3096.0s)]
*  It's unfortunate if people want to do things that are terrible for you. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3100.4s)]
*  It is unfortunate. But. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3103.48s)]
*  You the flip side is people are going to do it anyway. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3106.52s)]
*  And if you make it illegal, then you're propping up illegal enterprises. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3109.36s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, if I'm just, you know, at the end of the day, I'm a musician. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3113.44s)]
*  I don't know shit. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3118.2400000000002s)]
*  But if everything was legal, somebody goes in and buys whatever drug legally, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3119.52s)]
*  they're probably not going to be the least of fentanyl. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3124.32s)]
*  Exactly. You know, 100 percent. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3126.4s)]
*  Look, you would have more overdoses. You would have more deaths. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3128.1200000000003s)]
*  Like if they just decided today to make everything legal, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3132.1200000000003s)]
*  you're going to have a spike in deaths. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3135.88s)]
*  There's no way around that in my eyes. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3138.4s)]
*  But would you have a corresponding drop in fentanyl deaths? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3141.12s)]
*  I think you would. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3145.4s)]
*  So you would have a drop in accidental deaths where people just take a little molly. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3146.56s)]
*  They just want to go to a rave and just fucking dance. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3151.12s)]
*  And all of a sudden they're dead. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3153.32s)]
*  You would have way less of those. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3154.7200000000003s)]
*  So that would drop. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3156.56s)]
*  But you're going to have people that are just addicted to drugs. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3157.92s)]
*  They're going to overdose because of availability. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3160.44s)]
*  And you're going to have also people that try drugs that wouldn't have tried them [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3163.04s)]
*  because they're illegal and they don't want to. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3166.4s)]
*  They wouldn't know where to buy them. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3168.2000000000003s)]
*  They don't know anybody who's selling drugs. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3169.56s)]
*  If you could just go to a store and buy coke, like, oh, what's the fuss about? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3171.32s)]
*  Let me try this cocaine out. Yeah. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3174.76s)]
*  And the next thing you know, you're a coke addict and you've ruined your life. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3176.28s)]
*  That's possible, too. 100 percent. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3178.8s)]
*  But you know, that there's personal responsibility. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3180.4s)]
*  There's also education. There's counseling. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3184.28s)]
*  There's a bunch of different things that can be set up to mitigate that. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3186.56s)]
*  And I think that's the better direction for society, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3189.7200000000003s)]
*  but better than propping up cartels. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3192.28s)]
*  We've got this fucking thing that's happening right across our border [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3194.7200000000003s)]
*  where there's immense organizations that have insane amounts of money [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3198.52s)]
*  because they've been selling drugs that are illegal in America. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3203.92s)]
*  Yeah, like warlords. Yeah. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3206.88s)]
*  I mean, legit warlords. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3208.44s)]
*  I mean, some of those property owners down there, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3210.88s)]
*  I don't know how they're dealing with that. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3214.2000000000003s)]
*  Bro, I was just watching this video today of this guy who lives on the border. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3216.44s)]
*  They're dealing with all these people that come across the border. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3220.6400000000003s)]
*  That are smuggling drugs. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3224.24s)]
*  And it's fucking dangerous. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3225.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like you can't approach them, can't go anywhere near them. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3227.72s)]
*  You have no idea what they're carrying. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3229.8799999999997s)]
*  You have no idea who they are, what they're doing and who they work for. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3231.3599999999997s)]
*  And he's like, it's terrifying. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3235.2799999999997s)]
*  They're just traveling across your property with a backpack. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3236.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, and you just kind of just let it happen. Yeah. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3240.08s)]
*  And two years ago, I played a I played a show down in San Antonio [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3243.08s)]
*  and there was a rancher there at the show and we were talking afterwards. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3246.9199999999996s)]
*  And he said, and this would have been like [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3249.64s)]
*  right around that time. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3253.32s)]
*  This had just happened. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3254.72s)]
*  So this is April 21. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3256.08s)]
*  He said one of his best friends, who's also a rancher, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3258.28s)]
*  got a bunch of feds rolled up to their house one day [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3262.2400000000002s)]
*  and put him and his family on house arrest. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3265.28s)]
*  For two days without any explanation [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3269.2s)]
*  as to why. And then two days go by and they say, OK, it's all good. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3273.84s)]
*  You know, we're so sorry for the inconvenience. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3279.12s)]
*  And the guy's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3281.56s)]
*  You can't just you have you get there has to be an explanation here. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3283.96s)]
*  And I guess I don't know if I'm getting somebody to help here. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3288.84s)]
*  But the guy's like, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but we there are nine [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3291.96s)]
*  insurgents and that were that across the border. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3296.32s)]
*  And we, you know, just so happened to get them here on your property. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3299.64s)]
*  Oh, you know, I bet the feds were probably watching them. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3304.16s)]
*  And then when they decided to to actually take them, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3307.6s)]
*  it must have been on this guy's ranch. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3310.16s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, you got your your kid. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3312.52s)]
*  Your kids are out maybe doing a chore on the on your ranch, on your own farm. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3316.6s)]
*  So, yeah, you got thousands of acres or something. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3321.44s)]
*  And who knows what what you could be running into? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3323.3199999999997s)]
*  Have you seen some of the recent videos of the lines, the migration lines moving? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3328.0s)]
*  Not just in Mexico, they're moving from South America through Mexico. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3334.16s)]
*  Into the United States. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3340.16s)]
*  I saw the ones from like a few years back. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3341.3199999999997s)]
*  But I did. I've almost like tuned out. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3344.2s)]
*  The numbers are doing it again and stuff. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3346.24s)]
*  The numbers are insane. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3348.16s)]
*  Somebody just released a graph that shows the the numbers of illegal [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3350.08s)]
*  aliens over the last year in comparison to previous years. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3353.68s)]
*  So it's like you see the graph and it's like 2014, 2015, 2016. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3357.3599999999997s)]
*  And it gets to 2021, just like Yikes. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3362.3599999999997s)]
*  There's more illegals have made it into this country over the last year, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3366.92s)]
*  I believe, than are people that live in five different states legally. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3372.4s)]
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3378.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean, West Virginia's got one point. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3380.28s)]
*  Eight million on a real good year, maybe it's probably a little less than that. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3383.2000000000003s)]
*  And there's a lot more illegal aliens every year coming into. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3387.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, what's the number per month now? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3390.96s)]
*  What's the fix for something like that? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3392.8s)]
*  You got to fucking have a secure border if you want to fix it. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3395.2400000000002s)]
*  You seem like they want to fix it. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3398.28s)]
*  Like AOC was on TV the other day doing an interview. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3400.08s)]
*  And she was saying, you know, she was calling them undocumented people. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3403.44s)]
*  And the way to do it is to to give them a path to citizenship. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3406.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, how about you know who the fuck they are? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3410.52s)]
*  Because if you're a person from another country, say, if you're in Europe [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3413.12s)]
*  and you want to you want to come to America and become an American citizen, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3416.32s)]
*  you know, you're an architect or whatever, this is like a long, lengthy process. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3420.32s)]
*  They only take a certain amount of people every year. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3423.7599999999998s)]
*  And you have to prove that you have a skill. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3426.3199999999997s)]
*  There's a there's a reason why you should be here legally. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3428.44s)]
*  Yeah. But if you want to do it illegally, they'll give you money. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3431.44s)]
*  They'll give you a cell phone. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3434.0s)]
*  There's people in Mexico. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3435.48s)]
*  What they're doing is this is pretty wild because there's a radio station [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3437.3599999999997s)]
*  in San Diego that is a Mexican radio station. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3441.24s)]
*  This guy was on the Mexican radio station is explaining how we do it. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3444.44s)]
*  He's like he's gone back four times that month. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3448.16s)]
*  So every time he crosses over, he gets two thousand dollars. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3451.72s)]
*  He's gaming it. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3454.68s)]
*  So he's gaming. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3455.48s)]
*  He made eight thousand dollars in a month from the federal government. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3456.12s)]
*  You know, like, what do you do? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3460.64s)]
*  You set up because back in the day, you know, when. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3462.36s)]
*  There's, you know, I don't know everything, obviously, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3466.8399999999997s)]
*  but like maybe the similar time in American history would have been the early 1900s. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3470.36s)]
*  And he had all those Europeans coming over on the boats to to work over in the US. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3474.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And everybody went through Ellis Island or somewhere like it [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3479.72s)]
*  where you go in and you got some sort of papers. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3483.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty easy. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3485.84s)]
*  And yeah, and they at least, you know, they they got you like they got [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3486.96s)]
*  they at least they they got a name. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3491.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And they were not even they got people change. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3493.08s)]
*  Yeah, they change it right there. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3496.12s)]
*  If it's like too hard to pronounce. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3497.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of people. Yeah. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3498.8s)]
*  Yeah. My bass player's last name got got fucked with a little bit. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3500.72s)]
*  I'm sure. Yeah. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3504.8s)]
*  A lot of people's names got changed. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3505.84s)]
*  It was easy to come over here back then when my grandparents came here. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3507.64s)]
*  But, you know, that was the law back then. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3510.7999999999997s)]
*  This is not the law. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3513.68s)]
*  The law is that you're supposed to go through this process where they vet you [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3515.04s)]
*  and they find out if you're a criminal and they find out if you're a terrorist. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3518.88s)]
*  And yeah, they're not doing that at all. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3521.2799999999997s)]
*  They're just opening the border and they're essentially buying votes. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3523.16s)]
*  Yeah, they're doing this. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3526.7999999999997s)]
*  They're they're letting these people come in [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3528.12s)]
*  and they're assuming these people are going to vote for the Democrats. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3530.4s)]
*  And it's wild. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3533.2799999999997s)]
*  It's wild that it's happening right in front of everybody's eyes. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3534.2s)]
*  And most people aren't aware of it unless they see these videos. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3536.76s)]
*  Or like Elon was telling me that when you go there, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3539.28s)]
*  do you really understand the scope of it? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3542.88s)]
*  He goes, it's extraordinary. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3544.44s)]

*  It's just insane. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3550.0800000000004s)]
*  It's just and everyone knows about it. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3551.32s)]
*  So all these people that live in these and I don't I don't blame them at all, man. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3553.32s)]

*  You know, I mean, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  if you're not where you're at in life. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3618.04s)]
*  You know that you're never going to get there half ass in your day. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3621.08s)]
*  No. Wherever you happen to be, it might be the best idea to like, give it your best. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3624.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3630.48s)]
*  And that's like or else you're just going to be miserable. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3630.92s)]
*  Fuck the rest of your life. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3633.52s)]
*  Well, that was one thing that happened to a lot of people that was good. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3634.88s)]
*  They realized that this job that they had, they hated that just went away. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3638.04s)]
*  OK, you know, not only did I fucking hate this job, but I thought it was necessary [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3642.6s)]
*  because it was the only thing that I had. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3646.56s)]
*  I didn't want to lose it. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3648.0s)]
*  But then they just fucking took it away from me. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3649.36s)]
*  God damn it. I'm going to go for my fucking dream. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3651.08s)]
*  And a lot of people did. They went for their dream. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3653.4s)]
*  They started small businesses. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3655.44s)]
*  They got their shit together. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3656.84s)]
*  They lost weight. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3658.32s)]
*  A lot of people did a lot of very positive things when their back was against the wall. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3659.56s)]
*  And then a lot of people just went on unemployment. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3663.36s)]
*  And a lot of people never wanted to get on. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3665.8s)]
*  I mean, I had friends that were in the bar business and they couldn't get people to work. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3667.8s)]
*  They couldn't get bartenders. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3672.0s)]
*  They couldn't because people were making more money being unemployed. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3673.08s)]
*  Yeah. Taking unemployment. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3676.8s)]
*  And they would rather live like that. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3678.44s)]
*  They'd rather get that free check. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3679.8s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3681.16s)]
*  They and that that was like, you know, I'm 31. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3682.52s)]
*  And I released my first album in 2019, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3686.6s)]
*  but I didn't get booking and management and stuff like that until even after that. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3690.6s)]
*  So COVID cut the legs out from from me. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3696.88s)]
*  Things were just starting to actually look a little bit legitimate, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3700.68s)]
*  you know, in my life. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3705.6s)]
*  And COVID cut the legs out from under that. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3707.12s)]
*  So on the other side of that is really where, you know, I could have gone two ways. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3709.4s)]
*  And I went back on tour in the spring of 21. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3716.12s)]
*  And then I started taking my full band out with me and were seven piece, including myself [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3721.12s)]
*  and the summer of 21. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3726.68s)]
*  And I went broke in the fall. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3729.0s)]
*  Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3731.92s)]
*  I couldn't I couldn't pay my guys one week. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3733.72s)]
*  And I had my second album, which we made during the COVID year, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3737.12s)]
*  went on presale that next week. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3742.2s)]
*  And I explained to my guys what was happening. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3745.0s)]
*  And they stuck with me. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3748.12s)]
*  And once I put the presales up, then I got a little bit, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3749.96s)]
*  you know, to keep paying them and we were able to keep working. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3753.24s)]
*  And then I was bleeding real bad in 21. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3756.3199999999997s)]
*  And it came down to one point in Bloomington, Indiana. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3760.3599999999997s)]
*  We played the Bluebird one night. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3764.44s)]
*  And I just got a new day to day manager. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3766.68s)]
*  He's he's done a phenomenal job for me. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3770.0s)]
*  But anyways, he had just gotten on the job and basically broke it down for me on the phone [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3772.2799999999997s)]
*  how much I was losing per month and was just saying, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3776.6s)]
*  he's like, this is your you're you're going belly up here. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3780.2s)]
*  This this is over. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3783.3599999999997s)]
*  You have to cut half these guys. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3784.6s)]
*  And even then, we're going to have a hard time making it. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3788.04s)]
*  And after that gig, we all sat outside in the alleyway. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3790.44s)]
*  And I explained to them what was happening. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3795.64s)]
*  And they all took half pay. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3798.0s)]
*  So my guys were willing to go fifty dollars a show. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3801.7599999999998s)]
*  And they're in one hundred percent. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3806.64s)]
*  They didn't have the, you know, their jobs and stuff back home. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3808.4s)]
*  They're there with me. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3811.04s)]
*  And they were game to go for that, which you can't live off that. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3812.96s)]
*  And we we kept hanging on there for a couple of months. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3816.7599999999998s)]
*  And then that second album came out in November. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3821.24s)]
*  And we got on the road with Zach Brian, brought us out on the road with them. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3824.24s)]
*  And, you know, the the album, it worked. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3828.4799999999996s)]
*  You know, the album did great. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3831.72s)]
*  And we made the most of our opportunity to get an open that tour for him. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3833.72s)]
*  And, you know, we made it. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3837.8399999999997s)]
*  The universe rewards that. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3840.72s)]
*  I, you know, it was that close to just even if I wanted to, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3842.4799999999996s)]
*  I wouldn't have had money to even put in the gas tank. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3847.3999999999996s)]
*  But that's what makes the story beautiful. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3850.2799999999997s)]
*  The terrible stories you quit. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3852.56s)]
*  That's the terrible story. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3854.44s)]
*  You're sitting on the porch one day and you're an old man. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3855.64s)]
*  You don't God damn it. I think I could have made it. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3858.32s)]
*  Yeah. But I was the most bitter of people, man. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3860.32s)]
*  Those are the ones that talk the most shit about other artists. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3863.28s)]
*  They talk the most shit about other people, the people that just have these regrets, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3866.4s)]
*  the failed attempts, that they didn't go through the door. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3870.56s)]
*  They didn't do it. They didn't take that risk. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3874.0s)]
*  They didn't just run. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3876.92s)]
*  They didn't just fucking suck it up and try it. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3879.04s)]
*  That's a scary thing. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3882.12s)]
*  But if you can get through that scary thing, that's a better life. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3883.36s)]
*  That's a better life. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3887.36s)]
*  The life of fear and the life of regret. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3888.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a terrible life. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3890.84s)]
*  That life of wishing I could have the could have life. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3892.64s)]
*  That's the shittiest life. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3896.84s)]
*  Yeah. You don't want to be that. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3898.7200000000003s)]
*  God damn. You don't want to be that, especially when there was a spark, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3899.96s)]
*  when there's some potential. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3903.28s)]
*  Yeah. Like in the comedy world, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3904.68s)]
*  when you start out as an open micer, you start out with a bunch of [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3907.7200000000003s)]
*  fucking mental patients and crazy people. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3911.0s)]
*  And because anybody can go on stage, you know, and there's always like one [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3913.64s)]
*  or two guys that you're with or girls and they got something. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3918.24s)]
*  They got something. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3922.2799999999997s)]
*  And some of them make it and some of them don't. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3923.2s)]
*  And if there's a hundred of them, maybe one of them will become a professional. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3925.08s)]
*  Maybe it's probably not even that. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3928.04s)]
*  It's probably for 500 open micers, one. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3929.8399999999997s)]
*  It's probably not even that. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3933.7599999999998s)]
*  It's probably a thousand for every one thousand open micers [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3934.72s)]
*  that regularly shows up. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3938.2s)]
*  One of them will become a working professional. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3939.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. That can actually sell tickets. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3941.64s)]
*  But man, I have these fucking dreams sometimes where I remember these people [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3943.2799999999997s)]
*  that I knew that they had it, man. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3947.3199999999997s)]
*  They had something. They had something. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3948.96s)]
*  This is a girl that I dated when I was like 21. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3951.48s)]
*  It was like the last time I ever dated a comedian. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3954.48s)]
*  But God damn it, she was funny, man. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3956.7599999999998s)]
*  She was really funny. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3958.6s)]
*  She was really funny. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3960.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking, damn, she's funnier than me. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3961.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, she's funny, man. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3963.64s)]
*  She's good. Like she she could she had something. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3965.16s)]
*  And it wasn't always, you know, you'd have these open mics are rough, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3968.04s)]
*  like bad crowds, like sometimes you bomb, sometimes you do well. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3970.9199999999996s)]
*  But every now and then she would be on stage and she would catch that wave [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3974.68s)]
*  and they'd be like, look at her go. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3978.2s)]
*  Look at her go. She's going to do it. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3980.2799999999997s)]
*  She's going to make it. She fucking quit. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3981.72s)]
*  And I always I think about people like that. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=3984.68s)]

*  And sometimes and this is with me because like, you know, and even though it's a small thing, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4074.36s)]
*  you know, I wanted to play football for West Virginia and I wasn't good enough. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4080.2s)]

*  But, you know, that's something that, you know, so if somebody chases something out there and it [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4111.4800000000005s)]
*  doesn't work out, don't view that as a bad thing. It may pay off later when you find the next thing [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4115.400000000001s)]

*  in the past. So, you know, failure is very important because that feeling that sucky feeling of failure [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4123.88s)]
*  is an amazing motivator. Some of them like the big leaps that I've made in my career as a standup [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4131.8s)]

*  around and use that as inspiration. But you have to consciously understand what's happening here [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4275.24s)]
*  and other people's success that is not your failure. That's their success. And you could [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4280.6s)]
*  use that as fuel that could be inspiration. And it could be entirely positive. And if especially [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4285.32s)]
*  if you know those people, the saddest thing to me is when there's a friend and one friend has [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4292.52s)]

*  important. It's so valuable. And instead, people piss that fuel away as jealousy and bitterness, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4337.4s)]
*  where it does you no good. It poisons you. It ruins you. You're hoping for someone's failure. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4344.6s)]
*  It's such a terrible weakness. It's a terrible weakness of character that so many people just [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4351.4800000000005s)]

*  How the fuck do I incorporate this into my life? I need this. This is fuel for me. And to look at [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4398.84s)]
*  it that way. That's a way better way. And it's the same exact experience, the same exact materials. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4403.88s)]
*  But instead of using those materials to look like, why not me? Instead, you're like, fuck yeah, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4411.96s)]

*  It's just a mindset that you have to embrace. It's huge. Yeah. And I think without that, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4422.04s)]
*  I don't know if I would have made it. You know what I mean? Just those years, you have got to [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4427.16s)]
*  muster up all the positivity you can because you're not getting it from the bar, the restaurant, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4434.04s)]
*  and the brewery, and the cafes, and sleeping in the back of your car, being broke, folks coming [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4440.36s)]
*  up and telling you to turn it off. I mean, shit. So yeah, having that frame of mind gets you through [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4447.64s)]
*  those hard times. And the scene, I came up, basically in the West Virginia music scene, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4458.200000000001s)]
*  there isn't much of one. And it was not that. It was very much the fan mentality. So I got [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4465.0s)]
*  help from certain promoters and venue owners, but other established musicians in the state, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4471.0s)]
*  no. And when I recognized that at the time, I told myself if I'm ever in, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4476.68s)]
*  if I ever had the opportunity to, I'm going to do things differently. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4485.08s)]
*  And then once I started getting out there into the music world a little bit and actually playing [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4488.44s)]
*  some proper shows, man, I was blessed to get to open for very supportive people that helped me out [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4492.6s)]
*  and were happy to bring me on the road. That's awesome. And they wanted to bring the best show [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4501.08s)]
*  that they could. And I'll never forget that. And then I try to do that now. Who was the first [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4506.44s)]
*  person that brought you on the road? The first legit shows that I got to play and open for somebody [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4511.64s)]

*  with him and William was super cool to me. And I was nervous going into it because these are some [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4524.2s)]
*  of my first like actual venue shows outside of my hometown that I ever played. I've only [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4529.24s)]
*  done restaurants and bars before that. And I remember one night William was like, if you, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4533.88s)]

*  that was a good night then. That's awesome. Back in that day. And then Ward Davis took me out with [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4559.32s)]
*  him for two years. And you know, that allowed me to get my feet on the ground and start building [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4564.6s)]
*  a good loyal following. And you know, Ward's learned a lot of hard things, like a lot of [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4571.96s)]
*  things the hard way and shared a lot of experience with me, which has saved me some hard lessons. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4577.08s)]
*  That's important. Like someone who's a mentor that's gone through it already. Absolutely. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4581.88s)]
*  Can give you some advice. Yeah, absolutely. And then, and then Zach Brian, and you know, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4587.0s)]
*  in Zach's way, just opening up his giant following to, to us and letting us open, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4592.6s)]
*  you know, three of his tours. Oh, that's amazing. You know what I mean? And, and you know, those, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4599.08s)]
*  those three in particular, like we're, we're huge. And then, you know, I've opened for some fantastic [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4604.76s)]
*  people since then, but like those were the three that were like, you know, William was the first, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4610.84s)]
*  and then Ward was the, you know, Ward and Zach were the ones that I opened for the longest. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4615.4s)]
*  And yeah, it's, it's nice to be in a spot now where I get to pick folks that are coming up that are [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4621.48s)]
*  really, really fucking good and get to bring them out on the road and have them just the internet, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4627.719999999999s)]
*  you know, the internet, you know, hearsay and you just hear things about, about folks. One guy that [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4634.04s)]
*  he opened a West Coast tour with this, this summer. And this is like kind of that, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4640.44s)]
*  that great example of just like having a good, a good circle of folks that you're able to work with. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4645.08s)]
*  Wyatt Flores and Wyatt can't be opening for me now. Like I mean, we did our last show together. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4652.28s)]
*  He was my, one of my openers at the, at the Ryman. We did a shot after the second show. And I said, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4658.92s)]
*  now you got to remember this bud. Remember when you play Madison Square Garden the first time, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4664.679999999999s)]
*  you make sure you have me and the boys as your opener for that one. Cause you know, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4668.52s)]
*  just everybody's on their own timeline and why it's just, you know, his is, his is going real fast. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4673.160000000001s)]
*  That's awesome. Yeah. And it's great for him, man. That is cool. And that, that is where that [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4679.400000000001s)]
*  mentality comes in that other people's success is not your failure. It's just beautiful. Yeah. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4683.96s)]
*  My wife and my kids are fine. My band now, everybody's, you know, they're getting married, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4688.92s)]
*  getting homes and like, we're good. Everything's going to be fine. We just keep doing our thing. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4694.68s)]
*  Exactly. And the more, more folks that succeed, the better. Yes. Yes. And the world needs more [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4698.84s)]
*  great music. It really does. Ain't nobody that's only listened to one person. I always say iPod, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4705.400000000001s)]
*  nobody's got an iPod anymore, but there's nobody that's only listened to one artist in their, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4710.68s)]
*  on their Spotify or Apple. That's probably a stalker. You know what I mean? Like people [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4715.0s)]
*  are listening to a hundred different folks. Maybe Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift might have like one [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4719.0s)]
*  dude out there that only has Taylor Swift songs going 24 seven. He's got a Taylor Swift t-shirt. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4722.44s)]
*  He talks his dick in his fucking underwear and stands in the mirror and pretends he's her. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4727.879999999999s)]
*  There's a few people out there that might be listening. Yeah. God, imagine being her security [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4735.08s)]
*  detail. Jesus Christ. I'd be interested to hear, hear some of their stories. I bet there's been [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4741.5599999999995s)]
*  some, some shit. Oh my God. It has to be like there's, I mean, in the history of artists, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4747.48s)]
*  there's only a handful, small handful that have got to that Taylor Swift level. That's the level [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4753.959999999999s)]
*  where almost everyone goes crazy. I don't even think you can count it on two hands. I don't think [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4759.08s)]
*  so. No, it's like there's Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Elvis. There's like a few, but she's in [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4763.639999999999s)]
*  a crazy place, man. She's doing stadiums every night, every night, stadium, stadium, stadiums. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4770.44s)]
*  They sold out instantly. Tickets go for astronomical numbers. And then there's a stadium of people [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4777.08s)]
*  outside the stadium, just trying to listen to the echoes of the PA. That's something I've never [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4783.320000000001s)]
*  seen. Like you see some sold out stadium tours and stuff, but you don't see that. Yeah. Or like it's [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4790.68s)]
*  that overhead. And then it looks like the Washington mall outside of the stadium folks is trying to [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4795.96s)]
*  hear like that like echo of her voice from a half mile away. Some of the first live shows that I [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4801.56s)]
*  ever saw, I was a security guard at great woods. Great woods is this place in Mansfield, Massachusetts. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4807.4800000000005s)]
*  It's this like outside performance amphitheater. And some of the first shows that I ever saw live, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4813.400000000001s)]
*  first show I ever saw live was a Jay Giles band. Maybe it was George Thorogood. It was like George [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4820.280000000001s)]
*  Thorogood and Destroyers. And I think that was like the first band that I paid to see when I was [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4825.56s)]
*  a kid. But then when I was older and I worked as a security guard, I worked for this place. So I saw [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4833.400000000001s)]
*  concerts all the time. I saw so many different concerts. And I remember one time I saw Bon Jovi. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4840.04s)]
*  I was working the Bon Jovi concert and we were pulling the security truck up. And as we were [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4846.52s)]
*  pulling the truck up, we got out and outside of the venue here, shot through the heart and you're [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4852.36s)]
*  to blame. You give love a bad name. And everybody goes, and I was like, this is crazy. Because it [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4859.48s)]
*  was one of my first nights on the job. And I was like, hearing that pop for the first time, that [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4870.12s)]
*  energy is insane. It's insane. The energy of a live show is something that's just, because it's [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4874.52s)]
*  not just you're watching the performance, you're watching it with other people and they're all [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4883.8s)]
*  excited and you feel their excitement and everyone's happy and it's all, everyone's together [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4889.64s)]
*  and that fucking yeah, it's all together. It's wild. It's a beautiful thing, man. Oh, it's so [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4895.400000000001s)]
*  beautiful. Yeah, that's, it makes the travel worth it. To have that feeling where you got all those [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4901.16s)]
*  folks just like, they're all having that moment. The travel's rough. Together. The travel breaks you [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4908.12s)]
*  down. Do you do anything to keep the travel from breaking you down? Do you take vitamins? Do you [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4913.24s)]
*  take care of yourself at all? Yeah, yeah, I do. I do my best and I'm getting better as the years go [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4916.76s)]
*  by. I run just about every day. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, it's good for my cardio. I enjoy it. Good for [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4922.599999999999s)]
*  my head. And then yeah, I take vitamins. A lot of vitamin D trying to keep, my kids are in day care. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4930.2s)]
*  Oh my God, brother. They're little disease factories. Dude, I've been sick more in the last two years [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4936.92s)]
*  than I was the 10 years prior. It's crazy. Since my son first went in. It is like a little petri dish. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4942.92s)]
*  I'm going to come out like a cockroach here in 18 years. Oh yeah. You come out of that and you're like, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4948.12s)]
*  nothing gets you sick. But yeah, so I take vitamins. I started doing AG1. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4953.96s)]
*  That's great stuff. With the little droplets in it too, a couple months ago. Vitamin D, K2, yeah. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4960.12s)]
*  And kind of like everything is the same except I don't, that afternoon like, I could take a nap. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4966.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't have that when I'm taking that. That's good. That's the big difference I've been getting [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4974.84s)]
*  from that one. The hard thing is the diet when you're on the road. That's the hard thing. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4978.2s)]
*  Really make sure you eat clean. It just has a giant factor in whether or not you can recover. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4983.24s)]
*  The discipline there after the show is a big part of it. Yeah, the jack-in-the-box, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4988.280000000001s)]
*  Burger King pull is strong. Yeah, if I had perfect discipline, I'd look like an Olympian. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=4992.84s)]
*  I wouldn't be that strong, but I'd be pretty ripped. But we're moving to the bus this year. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5001.88s)]
*  So this will be my first year in the bus and I'm looking forward to that sleep. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5006.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if I can sleep that good on a bus. I'm always worried about crashing. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5011.0s)]
*  Because the thing about a bus, if you crash, it's like you just fall on top of everybody. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5015.96s)]
*  You're not even strapped in. It happens too, man. Oh yeah. What was that woman's name? Gloria [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5020.599999999999s)]
*  Estefan. She fractured her back. I think, yeah. Serious accident. Hardy had a bus accident I [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5026.599999999999s)]
*  think last year. Oh yeah? Yeah, I think it was pretty bad. It's scary shit, man. You gotta rely [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5033.08s)]
*  on that driver. Stay awake. Yeah. And then who knows what kind of fuckheads are on the road doing [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5042.44s)]
*  stupid shit and crashing into things. I've been driving myself for the seven years with my dogs [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5048.5199999999995s)]
*  and then sleeping in a rollout mat in the back of my car behind venues. Oh wow. The hard way. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5059.4800000000005s)]
*  Three years in the van with me and the guys and driving all day. So this is the only way I see [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5065.72s)]
*  me being able to keep my health up for the rest of my life is getting that sleep. Do you drink? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5075.72s)]
*  A little bit. I cut way back this year. You kinda gotta. Yeah. I get into the 30s, things [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5080.76s)]
*  start sticking to you a little bit more. I was looking at myself at, we went to the beach back [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5088.12s)]
*  at the end of May and I was looking at pictures of myself. I was like, yeah, that's it. I gotta [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5094.5199999999995s)]
*  lock this shit down or it's getting away from me. Well, it's just the fatigue factor. The difference [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5099.4s)]
*  between drinking and not drinking, like how you feel the next day is so significant. It's hard to [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5105.08s)]
*  ignore. It's hard to ignore that fatigue factor. You're poisoning yourself every night. Yeah. It's [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5110.5199999999995s)]
*  fun. Yeah, it's great. Have a few beers, throw a few shots back. Woo. Have a little party. It's [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5116.68s)]
*  great. Parties are fun, but you are legitimately poisoning yourself and you gotta be aware of what [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5122.6s)]
*  the effect of that is. Yeah. And it's not good for the voice either. Sometimes I'll do four headlines [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5129.400000000001s)]
*  in a row. That's like Zakk smoked cigarettes, like a chimney. I was like, how are you doing that? You [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5134.84s)]
*  have this fucking incredible gift, this amazing voice and you're sucking on cigarettes all the [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5141.72s)]
*  time. Yeah. He's a pup still. He is a young boy. He's a young fella. One day. Maybe. I don't know. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5147.8s)]
*  I mean, maybe his voice will change with the cigarettes like Sinatra's. Yeah. You ever hear [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5156.68s)]
*  Sinatra when he was young? Oh yeah. Yeah. There's really the fifties, like Christmas songs and stuff. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5160.92s)]
*  It sounds different. It's strange, strangely different. It's like a completely different kind of voice. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5167.08s)]
*  When he got older, it was like this. I did it my way. But when he was younger, it was just like [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5173.240000000001s)]
*  this insane voice, like this beautiful, you know, he was arrested. I have one of his mug shots out [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5179.72s)]
*  there. I have a whole collection of mug shots out there in the lobby. One of them is Sinatra. And [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5185.08s)]
*  he was arrested for seduction. Yeah. I think it banged somebody's wife. The wrong person's wife, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5189.96s)]
*  I guess. Somebody like the mayor's, like the police chief's wife. That was listed on his rap [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5198.68s)]
*  sheet. It was seduction. See that? That's true, right? That's an old school law right there. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5205.32s)]
*  Here it is. Seduction. Let me explain. The year was 1938. Years before Sinatra would go [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5210.68s)]
*  on to star in his first movie or release his first single. He was just 23 years old by today's [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5216.44s)]
*  standards. Shocking that he spent any time in jail for his crime, even though it was less than 16 [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5220.44s)]
*  hours. So during that time period, a person could be arrested for seduction, which was a charge [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5225.799999999999s)]
*  usually given to a man who slept with a woman based on false promises or using some kind of lie. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5231.32s)]
*  Oh, interesting. For instance, a man could be arrested after sleeping with a woman after a [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5237.4s)]
*  false promise of marriage. Wow. Reportedly, Sinatra's ex-girlfriend was his accuser. Also, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5241.88s)]
*  it wasn't a wife. I was wrong. Saying that he promised her marriage and then broke up with her. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5248.12s)]
*  You get arrested because you break up with a girl? That's hilarious. Frank was willing to say [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5253.4800000000005s)]
*  anything to get in that night. However, it turns out that she was actually already married, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5259.0s)]
*  which canceled out the charges of seduction. That's why I thought it was someone's wife. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5265.16s)]
*  Even so, the state of New Jersey arrested Sinatra and charged him with adultery after learning that [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5269.08s)]
*  they could nab him with seduction. The charges later dropped after he paid a $500 bond. $500 in [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5274.6s)]
*  1938. That's probably a stiff bond. That's a lot of money back then, dude. People buy a house for [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5281.5599999999995s)]
*  like $500. Yeah, in Detroit right now. Yeah, it's true. I thought about that right as I said. See, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5287.72s)]
*  you can find some recordings of Sinatra from when he was young, because it really is crazy when you [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5293.48s)]
*  listen to the difference in that music, the sound of that voice. That's got to be like a lot of Jack [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5298.52s)]
*  Daniels and cigarettes. I think the earliest I've listened to him is maybe the 40s. If he was singing [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5303.72s)]
*  in the 30s there, I probably haven't heard that. It's an incredible voice, but it's so different. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5310.6s)]
*  It's hard to believe that it's actually Sinatra, because it sounds so young and high pitched. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5316.280000000001s)]
*  It's just a different... They had so much range. His voice had this incredible range that all got [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5321.56s)]
*  blunted by the cigarettes. Then as he got older, it just became... I had regrets. It became almost [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5327.24s)]
*  more talking than the vocal range that he had when he was younger. It just kind of adapted. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5336.52s)]
*  All the years of kind of like just playing night in, night out too can take somebody's range away. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5343.0s)]
*  Vocal surgeries and stuff like that. It torches your throat. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5349.64s)]
*  That's different. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5360.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5372.04s)]
*  So this is the wig days. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5378.68s)]
*  Strange times. It is. Looking right at the camera, doing the hand work. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5395.16s)]
*  Well, you got to think back then, that's all new. Being on television was new. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5401.0s)]
*  He's the fucking man right there back then. There was no one on TV before him. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5406.52s)]
*  How many years of television even existed before that? Was it 10? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5412.4400000000005s)]
*  It was like 15. Maybe. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5417.400000000001s)]
*  What was it, the early 50s when those late shows started? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5419.080000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. If you go back and watch those... What's crazy is, if you go back and watch those [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5422.52s)]
*  shows, especially the late night talk shows, like the Jack Parr show and stuff like that, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5427.72s)]
*  that thing where you have the desk and then someone sits beside on the couch, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5432.76s)]
*  they still do it that way today. They fucking never adjusted. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5437.32s)]
*  It's the same. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5442.04s)]
*  Weird. It's weird. Why do you have a desk? Are you working? Are you writing books up there? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5443.0s)]
*  Why do you have a fucking desk? Why are you sitting in front of that desk? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5448.6s)]
*  And it's just like, that was the Tonight Show. Ladies and gentlemen, hey, have a seat. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5451.72s)]
*  And you got this guy sitting there at a desk and next to him, it's a couch. This is a bizarre way [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5456.2s)]
*  to do a show. But because it was the way they did it originally, these uncreative motherfuckers [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5461.8s)]
*  just kept doing it that way forever. And everybody does it that way. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5467.88s)]
*  Yeah, they still do. The only person, like Norm MacDonald, man. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5470.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5475.8s)]
*  Fuck. I'd sit there on YouTube and just watch his late night show interviews where he's in that [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5476.360000000001s)]
*  situation. He turned that in. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5482.04s)]
*  No, he was the man. A few people did it differently. Arsenio Hall did it differently. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5486.52s)]
*  Arsenio Hall had like seats where they were sitting next to each other. He did it differently. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5491.24s)]
*  George Lopez did it differently. George Lopez just had like seats. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5496.92s)]
*  They just kind of faced each other. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5501.24s)]
*  Kind of like Letterman's Netflix show that he does now. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5502.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5507.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5507.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a cool setup. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5508.12s)]
*  It's a good setup. The only problem is that way of talking to people, you don't really... [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5509.72s)]
*  It's too performative. There's people there. A real conversation, it's not the same when there's an [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5517.0s)]
*  audience. It's a different thing. Sometimes it's a fun thing. Live podcasts in front of an audience, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5524.280000000001s)]
*  they can be great. But it's a different thing. It's not the same thing that you get from just [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5529.0s)]
*  sitting in a room with someone and having a conversation with them, which is the best way [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5536.04s)]
*  to talk to people. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5539.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, you're getting a little bit of the public persona of somebody if you're in a theater [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5540.04s)]
*  and you're doing an interview. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5547.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, everybody does it differently. Be Real, who we were talking about before, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5549.8s)]
*  he has a show called Hot Box. Is it called the Hot Boxing? No, that's Mike Tyson. Mike Tyson's Hot [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5552.84s)]
*  Boxing. What's Be Real's show where he has this old, cool car that they've done up and they've got [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5558.84s)]
*  cameras inside of it? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5566.280000000001s)]
*  Smokebox. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5567.240000000001s)]
*  Smokebox. And you get barbecued. I mean, barbecued to a place you don't know what you're talking [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5568.360000000001s)]
*  about five seconds ago. And you're on this podcast just getting baked and you're stuck in [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5574.76s)]
*  this car with Be Real. And those guys are, nobody smokes weed like rappers. You want to smoke? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5581.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5586.68s)]
*  You ever smoke weed with rappers? [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5587.24s)]
*  No. No, I can only imagine. I was ice fishing with Jamie Johnson last week and I was just [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5588.280000000001s)]
*  trying to keep up with him and he had me blasted there. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5594.76s)]
*  Yeah. It can get tricky. And I'm sure Jamie Johnson can hang in there too. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5598.360000000001s)]
*  He definitely can. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5603.8s)]
*  I'm sure he could do it. But I tried smoking weed with Snoop and Wiz Khalifa. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5604.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. You were going heavy weights. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5611.320000000001s)]
*  Action Bronson. Action Bronson did the podcast once. We had to take a picture of all the blunt [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5612.76s)]
*  that were in the ashtray at the end of the podcast because it was so ridiculous. Like, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5617.400000000001s)]
*  how are you alive? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5621.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, dude. Some folks, their tolerance. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5622.76s)]
*  We might have posted this. It's like this at the first 48 hours. Like, how many blunts he has in [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5625.8s)]
*  this thing? [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5629.88s)]
*  That's Snoop? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5630.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5630.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5631.16s)]
*  40? 30? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5632.599999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy. When he did this podcast, the whole time he's talking, he's just rolling [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5633.32s)]
*  blunts and he rolls his own blunts. So he's sitting there talking to you and he's just like, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5640.04s)]
*  we're talking about shit. He's just rolling blunts. He had a sound machine with him. He [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5644.599999999999s)]
*  had like lights and shit. Like, oh, he's such a character. Snoop is an original. That's an [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5649.639999999999s)]
*  original human being. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5655.16s)]
*  I love those. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5656.28s)]
*  Everybody loves him too, man. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5657.08s)]
*  Oh my God. How do you not love him? He's a great guy. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5658.28s)]
*  There's one of the few people in the world where there's like a second grader that knows who he [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5659.48s)]
*  is and my mom knows who he is. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5663.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Remember, he was doing that show with Martha Stewart. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5665.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5667.719999999999s)]
*  And it was great. Who would have ever thought that that teaming would work? That that pair [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5668.36s)]
*  would work? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5674.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, back in the day, you'd never see that coming. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5674.679999999999s)]
*  Well, perfect. Works great. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5676.44s)]
*  She got done dirty. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5677.879999999999s)]
*  She did. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5678.839999999999s)]
*  Back in the day. I mean, shit. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5679.799999999999s)]
*  They got her. They got her and they put her in jail for the same shit Nancy Pelosi's made [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5681.16s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars for. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5685.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5686.5199999999995s)]
*  So many of those folks in Congress and in the Senate, they all do that. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5688.52s)]
*  I wonder what happened. Why they went after her like that. I wonder what the real story behind [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5691.64s)]
*  it was. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5695.64s)]
*  She must have pissed somebody off. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5696.68s)]
*  Yeah. There had to be something. Otherwise, it doesn't even make sense. Why would you scalp [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5698.92s)]
*  her? Why are you going after her? Martha Stewart? What? You don't like beautiful things? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5703.64s)]
*  Well, and Nelson was saying in his book, he thought they came after him. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5709.4800000000005s)]
*  Look at her. Still hot. Look at her. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5712.92s)]
*  Woo. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5715.72s)]
*  Man, she looks great. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5716.04s)]
*  She's looking good. Got a little Zempik or something. Woo. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5716.68s)]
*  That's a thing, isn't it? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5721.88s)]
*  Yeah. It's a dangerous thing to some people. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5723.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5725.4800000000005s)]
*  Some people, it gives them hard. My friend Brian got horrible side effects. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5726.52s)]

*  them affects their gut very badly. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5734.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5736.84s)]

*  And work out. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5743.96s)]
*  Lose that weight. Just not eat shit. Cut all the sugar out of your life. You will watch [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5744.52s)]

*  There's another way to do it. But that's not what people want. People want that quick fix. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5754.120000000001s)]
*  Especially if you're a weed smoker. If you're a weed smoker and you just want to. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5761.240000000001s)]
*  All the munchies. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5765.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5770.04s)]
*  Especially late night. It's hard. It's hard not to just fatten up. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5770.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5775.16s)]

*  I'm sure. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5779.08s)]
*  Like, you know. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5779.64s)]
*  It's hard. It's hard. You have to have healthy choices. Like something that you can eat that [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5780.44s)]
*  you actually enjoy. One of the things I really like doing like late night after a gig, I like [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5785.8s)]
*  cooking. I'll come home and cook a steak at like one in the morning. I'm like, look, I'm a fucking [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5790.28s)]
*  grown man. I could eat whatever I want. Like, I could cook a steak right now. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5796.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5801.639999999999s)]
*  Just cook a steak. You're hungry. Don't just go pour a bowl of Froot Loops. Make a fucking steak. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5801.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5808.04s)]
*  Like, let's eat something healthy. Let's eat real food. Let's have some vitamins, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5808.44s)]
*  drink some water. Let's do it the right way. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5811.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And that's another thing I'm looking forward to that bus. Because, you know, we can stash some [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5813.88s)]
*  better options on there for after a show. And yeah, I think it'll. I think it's going to help. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5819.08s)]
*  They pulled over Willie's bus in Texas and arrested him. Isn't that amazing? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5824.36s)]
*  When did they do that? What the fuck? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5829.5599999999995s)]
*  I want to say it was like 2000. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5831.4s)]
*  Oh, that's fucked up. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5833.4s)]
*  2007 or some shit. 2009. When did Willie Nelson get arrested? It might have even been later than [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5834.44s)]
*  that. It might have been 2013. There was something crazy where the whole world was like, what? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5841.0s)]
*  2010. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5845.96s)]
*  2010. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5846.92s)]
*  85 miles outside of El Paso. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5847.719999999999s)]
*  For weed. Willie Nelson. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5851.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5853.32s)]
*  What are you, a communist? Fuck. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5853.64s)]
*  Yeah. That's like butchering the Texas Longhorn mascot or something. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5855.96s)]
*  It's so stupid, too. It's like the dumbest thing to arrest someone for. Jesus Christ. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5861.240000000001s)]
*  How are we still doing this in 2024? We're not, really. Like, it's decriminalized in Austin, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5866.280000000001s)]
*  but it's still illegal in the state of Texas. It's still federally illegal, even though it's [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5873.56s)]
*  legal in a bunch of states. It's still federally illegal. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5877.8s)]
*  That's the thing in music is people will stop and dump it off in the van and stuff like that. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5881.32s)]
*  Yep. So stupid. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5888.36s)]
*  Kansas, too, is another one. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5890.28s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of states where when you go through the airport, they have a designated [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5892.12s)]
*  marijuana depositing box. So if you're traveling and you're going to fly into a state where it's [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5896.04s)]
*  illegal, you just dump it in this box. Like in Nevada, they have that because Nevada has [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5902.679999999999s)]
*  these weed dispensaries. They have stores now where you can buy it legally. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5908.2s)]
*  If you're flying to the airport, you're like, all right, I don't want to get caught. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5913.639999999999s)]
*  Dump it in this box. At the end of the night, I bet those people that work there raid that box. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5918.2s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5924.04s)]
*  Of course. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5925.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. We're going to do Canada for the first time this year. That was like a thing that our tour [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5926.5199999999995s)]
*  manager was telling all the guys, make sure you get your passports going now and make sure [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5934.12s)]
*  plan on not having any weed when we cross the border. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5941.24s)]
*  Well, it's legal in Canada. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5945.8s)]
*  Yeah, but you can't cross with it. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5947.24s)]
*  Right. You can't cross with it. But once you're there, you can buy it there. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5949.32s)]
*  Why don't you bring it with you? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5952.44s)]
*  Yeah. They got dispensaries up there. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5953.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I remember when it was illegal in Canada and then all of a sudden I went there one year [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5955.8s)]
*  and it was like, oh my God, there's weed stores everywhere. That's how it should be. It should [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5959.16s)]
*  be legal. You don't like it? Good. There's a lot of things I don't like. It doesn't mean it [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5962.76s)]
*  should be illegal. You don't have to take it. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5969.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I was kind of hoping back home they would legalize it in West Virginia, [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5972.92s)]
*  kind of more at the front end of the states and made some of that money. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5978.04s)]
*  We needed that. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5982.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. That's the thing that's really crazy. They're biting off their nose to spite their face. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5983.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I missed out on it. We could have been selling to people in all the border states there [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5987.08s)]
*  for a good handful of years and making good money. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5991.16s)]
*  Are you living there now? [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5993.72s)]
*  Yeah. I still live there with my wife and kids. That's where I go back to when I'm off the road. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=5994.76s)]
*  You plan on living there forever? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6001.24s)]
*  I'll always have my family. We have family land that I'll always, at my great grandmother's house. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6002.68s)]
*  So I'll always keep that. Whether my wife and I end up splitting time maybe between there and [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6011.08s)]
*  somewhere else, that might happen. But yeah, I'll never leave that completely. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6015.48s)]
*  Feel like it's in your bones? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6021.16s)]
*  Yeah. I love it, man. It's like my comfortable place in the world. It's truly home. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6023.08s)]
*  That's nice. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6027.72s)]
*  I'm fortunate to feel that way about where I'm from. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6029.72s)]
*  That is very fortunate. That's beautiful. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6033.08s)]
*  Yeah. Not everybody does. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6035.08s)]
*  It's nice to have a place that grounds you too, where you go back and you're like, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6036.36s)]
*  I'm at home base again. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6039.639999999999s)]
*  Especially for a guy like you that does the road so much and all the travel. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6041.8s)]
*  Yeah. I like my routine, my small town. I grew up with so many people I see [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6046.44s)]
*  around on the day to day. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6051.08s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6052.44s)]
*  Folks watch me grow up, the older folks. They know me. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6055.0s)]
*  Yeah, I get to go about my day to day life and it's all very, very normal. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6061.16s)]
*  Even in Nashville, it's not that because everybody's in music. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6067.4s)]
*  You got people that they want something from you or something like that. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6072.76s)]
*  Yeah. That's what I keep hearing about Nashville, that Nashville's become kind [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6077.0s)]
*  of a Hollywood light in a lot of ways. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6080.12s)]
*  And it's great. I'm just saying there's a lot of people in the music industry. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6083.64s)]
*  If you're in the music industry, then you're going to get people come up and ask you this [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6088.84s)]
*  and ask you that. At home, there ain't nobody in the music industry. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6093.8s)]
*  So there ain't nobody that has anything to ask of me. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6097.32s)]
*  That's where I'm comfortable. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6101.96s)]
*  Yeah. That's nice. It's nice that someone's not trying to angle on you [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6103.32s)]
*  and just use you for something else or get to this to you or connect themselves to you. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6107.24s)]
*  There's so many social climbers and so many people that they've got a business they want [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6112.5199999999995s)]
*  you to invest in. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6117.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And that's what, when I met you, I met you the first time at Two Step In, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6119.48s)]
*  that festival north of Austin back in April. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6124.44s)]
*  That was when Zach was playing. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6128.12s)]
*  Yeah. And I met you just real brief and that was the last thing that I even wanted to come off. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6129.4s)]
*  That's why I was real weird when I met you that first time because it's like, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6134.28s)]
*  hey man, it's nice to meet you. I don't want to bother you. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6137.5599999999995s)]
*  Just because I can only imagine what you run into on the day to day. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6140.759999999999s)]
*  So yeah, it's nice back home. I don't get that so much. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6145.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's an unfortunate aspect of the life that I have, but this life is so fortunate in so many [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6151.08s)]
*  ways. I'm so blessed. I'm so extraordinarily lucky that the complaint about that. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6158.84s)]
*  I mostly put it out there so people realize that's something that comes with this. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6166.68s)]
*  You should know. And if you're on that path too, you're on the path to, you want to be in show [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6173.8s)]
*  business, you want to be in entertainment, or if you just want to be successful, I think, [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6178.52s)]

*  not talking out of my ass. Well, it sounds like again, I'm a musician. At the very least, they're [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6828.52s)]
*  just just this is all knowledge. This is my dad's knowledge that I'm trying to like spit back out. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6835.4s)]
*  Just make sure I'm not talking out of my ass. Ten thousand acres. Whoa. That's pretty big. That's [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6841.08s)]
*  miles. That's fucking huge. Ten thousand acres and it's a mine. Hobart Mine Complex. Holy shit. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6847.24s)]
*  Where's that? West Virginia. I just have in West Virginia. I'm sure there's bigger ones in Colorado. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6854.84s)]
*  Do they have footage of that? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6860.28s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be a lot underground. So yeah, but I'd like to see it. I just want to see [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6865.72s)]
*  what it looks like. Ten thousand acres of mines. Holy shit, man. That's incredible. Yeah, they got [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6870.28s)]
*  some big ones out in Utah. Alabama's got some big ones. I think Drummond knows those. I would have [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6878.68s)]
*  never guessed. I would have never guessed they're that big underground. Oh, that's a strip mine. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6885.96s)]
*  That's strip mines. That's different. That's the like underground coal mine footage. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6890.76s)]
*  It's a hard life, man. That's a hard life. Yeah. And in some places, it's the only thing that's [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6899.0s)]
*  available in certain parts of the country. Yeah, it was a great opportunity for my dad. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6904.36s)]
*  It allowed him to elevate himself economically. Does he have lung problems because of it? [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6910.360000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, he doesn't. No, he was, I think starting in the early 70s, I think they [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6918.04s)]
*  figured a lot of that out. Oh yeah? Yeah, I don't think it was as bad then as it was [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6926.2s)]
*  back in the 50s and before. Yeah, I don't think he has any long-term issues. You know, Sturgell has [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6931.08s)]
*  a lot of people in his family that came from that too. It's like that is just a different [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6942.2s)]
*  understanding of hard work and of poverty too. I mean, the people that when those mines shut down, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6948.04s)]
*  that's another sort of similar example. Those mines, if they shut down, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6957.320000000001s)]
*  the whole town relies on those mines and there's nothing. Yeah, you got ghost towns in West Virginia. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6961.88s)]
*  Got, do you ever read the book Rocket Boys? No. By Homer Hickam. Then they made the movie October [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6969.0s)]
*  Sky about it. Do you ever watch that? No, what is it? Dude, it's an incredible. Look at that machine. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6975.96s)]
*  Holy shit. There you go. Yeah. What causes coal? It's vegetation and pressure over [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6984.04s)]
*  millions of years, isn't it? Is that what it is? I think. Wow. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=6994.28s)]
*  Wow, look at this fucking life, man. Underground, just using machines to cut out chunks of the earth [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7001.48s)]
*  that people are going to light on fire. And then most people want to ban that shit anyway. But [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7009.5599999999995s)]
*  meanwhile, China, we're just looking at how many, like when people are talking about, we got to [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7013.8s)]
*  stop people from eating meat to save the planet, bitch. You need to pay attention to the world [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7019.48s)]
*  because most of that shit's coming from China. There's more than a thousand coal mines in China. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7024.36s)]
*  Yeah. There's more tonnage of coal being mined now than ever before in history. Crazy. Yeah. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7029.24s)]
*  Yeah. It's a complicated world with a lot of really narrow-minded narratives, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7037.96s)]
*  like a lot of confusing things that people repeat that they don't really understand [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7043.32s)]
*  the whole depth of what they're saying. Yeah. You could close down all the mines [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7047.639999999999s)]
*  in the United States and that demand for that coal is still going to be there. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7052.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And it'll just get mined somewhere else. Yeah. That's not to say that maybe there'll come [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7056.44s)]
*  a day where coal probably becomes a thing of the past and isn't used anymore, but. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7061.24s)]
*  Probably. Once they run out of it. Yeah. Once they run out of it or they think it's something [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7066.68s)]
*  better, but it's just. And then we're going to have to deal with earthquakes and sinkholes [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7071.72s)]
*  because they're going to fucking carve these huge fucking pockets out of the earth and things are [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7075.72s)]
*  going to collapse. Yeah. Yeah. At the end of the day, that's not going to solve the world's [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7080.280000000001s)]
*  problems if they just shut all that down in the US overnight. I watched a video of a coal mine [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7087.240000000001s)]
*  collapsing in China and it was horrifying. My friend, Tom Sager and I, every day we send [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7092.12s)]
*  each other the worst shit we find on Instagram. It's very traumatizing. It's like, I'll show it [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7099.32s)]
*  to you on my phone after the podcast is over. You're going to go, what the fuck, man? Every day, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7105.08s)]
*  every day we send each other car accidents, gunshots, animal attacks over and over and every day. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7109.56s)]
*  Every day, some new shit. Yeah. And one of them was this insane coal explosion. This is it. This [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7116.76s)]
*  is it. So these people are working in this. Oh my God. Yeah. They just get engulfed. Open pit [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7124.76s)]
*  coal mine collapsed. Four people injured, six missing, 49 others. Yeah. Don't guess where. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7132.04s)]
*  53 folks. They're dead. They might be missing. They're dead. Massive landslide. Wow. Yeah. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7141.32s)]
*  Wow. That's when you're digging into the fucking ground and creating instability. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7147.88s)]
*  Scary shit. Yeah. Yeah. That's insane. Yeah. And the people want to stop coal mining. I understand. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7152.92s)]
*  But you have to understand how much of that is going on outside this country. We detailed that [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7160.28s)]
*  yesterday. We went into this sort of a deep dive on it. Most of it is coming from China. Most of [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7164.76s)]
*  it's China. And then second place is India. United States is minimal in comparison to what's going on [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7169.96s)]
*  over there. And they're not going to stop. They don't give a fuck. They don't give a fuck about [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7175.56s)]
*  what you say about the environment. Like what? Yeah. Over there in Paris, like when they're all [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7180.44s)]
*  having that conference, like they don't give a shit about what they're saying and those things. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7184.44s)]
*  Well, it's just crazy when they're talking about climate change and then they cornered Bill Gates. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7189.08s)]
*  Like you fly here on a private jet. Like what? It's like, yeah, I actually have one of the largest [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7192.6s)]
*  carbon footprints. Like, so you're a hypocrite. Like, what's your real angle here, buddy? Like, [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7197.8s)]
*  you probably have a business that profits from people deciding to take a green angle. And that's [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7204.28s)]
*  really what's going on. He's trying to push plant based meat and a bunch of other bullshit. And [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7210.84s)]
*  that's why it's important for him to get that narrative out there about climate change. Just [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7216.04s)]
*  like during the pandemic, he was heavily invested in mRNA vaccines. And then at the end, he bailed, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7220.28s)]
*  he sold all his shares and then started talking shit. Like it wasn't as effective as we hoped. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7226.84s)]
*  Like what about what you were saying in the beginning when you were saying it was really [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7231.08s)]
*  effective and everyone needs to take it? Remember that? Why is anybody listening to that guy either, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7235.8s)]
*  by the way, when it comes to public health, you look like one of the least fucking healthy people [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7240.92s)]
*  alive. Like as far as people his age, he looks way older than he should look. He's got a pot belly. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7245.08s)]
*  He looks like shit. Yeah. It was like total shit. Yeah. And that vaccine thing, that was, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7251.64s)]
*  I had to get that, I had to show that to play my shows. Yeah. And 21. Yeah. And I felt [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7259.320000000001s)]
*  like I had to do it in order to work. A lot of people did. A lot of my friends did. They did it [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7265.88s)]
*  because they had to. People were coerced and then it didn't even work. Then I ended up getting it. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7270.92s)]
*  Yeah. Of course. And you know, it was fine. It was like a cold for a little bit. Yeah. It wasn't [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7276.12s)]
*  what we were feared, what we're afraid of. And then you realize like, oh, there's a lot of, [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7284.04s)]
*  there's a lot of motivation that they have to scare the shit out of you because that's how [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7290.5199999999995s)]
*  you'll do it. Remember when the White House, this is during Omicron, which is like the most mild [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7294.68s)]
*  version of COVID. It was basically just a mild cold for most people, especially healthy people. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7299.8s)]
*  And the White House put out a release that said, for the vaccinated people, you've done your job. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7305.400000000001s)]
*  For the unvaccinated people, you're looking at a winter of severe illness and death. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7312.92s)]
*  Yeah. Which is- Where did that come from? They're cunts. That's what it came from. You're a bunch [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7321.08s)]
*  of cunts. Yeah. And it's not even true. It wasn't even true. I mean, the number of people that are [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7325.24s)]
*  dying from COVID now, like the CDC is like, we need to get, people need to get vaccinated. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7329.88s)]
*  The COVID deaths are up. No, they're not. Go look. They're really low. They're super low. And by the [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7334.36s)]
*  way, those people that are dying, they're in terrible shape. They're not doing good already. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7340.4400000000005s)]
*  And most of the people that died, even during the pandemic, it was some of the age, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7345.4800000000005s)]
*  some of the range of 90% of the people that died had an average of four comorbidities. Yeah. Four [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7350.76s)]
*  things that were killing them and then COVID got them. And then also there was the thing where [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7357.32s)]
*  the hospital had an incentive to say that- Yeah. COVID deaths. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7362.44s)]
*  ... so-and-so died from COVID. Yeah. Yeah. When- [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7366.28s)]
*  My friend's grandpa had some horrible disease and he didn't have COVID. And when he died, [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7370.2s)]
*  he died in a nursing home. They listed him as a COVID death. And he was furious. He was like, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7376.679999999999s)]
*  he didn't have fucking COVID, man. They didn't even test him for COVID, but they listed him [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7381.799999999999s)]
*  as a COVID death. Get that money. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7386.6s)]
*  Exactly. There was a financial incentive to list people as COVID deaths. Yeah. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7388.280000000001s)]
*  And that's how you inflate the numbers and that's how you motivate people to take that vaccine. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7393.64s)]
*  It's wild, man. It's wild what they pulled off. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7398.04s)]
*  It's a lot of goofy shit in that year, year and a half, two years. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7400.6s)]
*  Scary. Scary what happened. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7403.96s)]
*  My wife and I talked about it and we drew the hard line with our children. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7406.68s)]
*  We weren't going to do that. Good for you. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7411.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Good for you. Because my kids were [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7413.08s)]
*  being pressured by some of their families, friends, like their families, like their kids [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7416.12s)]
*  were getting it and their families were wondering why my kids weren't getting it. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7423.32s)]
*  I'm like, hey man, you can go fuck yourself. This shit's all totally experimental. And by the way, [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7426.76s)]
*  the early data, very early on, it was shown that it's not dangerous for kids. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7430.92s)]
*  Both of my kids got it and it was nothing. I mean, nothing. They've had flus that knocked [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7436.44s)]
*  them on their ass and this was nothing like that. It was very mild for the kids. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7440.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You get over it just fine. What Tim Kennedy say? My kids shit it out in a day. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7445.56s)]
*  Look, obviously I experienced the backlash in the wildest way because I got healthy quick [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7453.240000000001s)]
*  without the vaccine, but they came for me in a way that was so stupid. It was such a checkers move. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7459.4800000000005s)]
*  It was such a dumb move because you're going after a guy for taking a medication that worked. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7466.04s)]
*  Yeah. By the way, it was one medication amongst many medications that I said I took. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7472.6s)]
*  Here I am three days after this thing that's supposed to kill you. I'm 55. I'm not young, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7479.64s)]

*  medicine. It's like that's when you get to see how corrupt the media is. That they're all on CNN and [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7505.0s)]
*  MSNBC and all these different shows lying, straight up lying. I didn't take horse dewormer. I took [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7510.68s)]

*  injecting you with shit. They're about staying healthy all the time. I've been preaching the [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7548.12s)]
*  value of a healthy lifestyle, healthy diet, and vitamin supplementation forever. When I get sick, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7555.0s)]
*  I get over it quick. If I got sick at all, the only reason why I got sick was I was out with my [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7563.08s)]
*  friend John Schoeman, who is a, shout out to my friend John, who is a pool cue manufacturer. I [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7568.84s)]

*  why I got sick. Yeah, we get that run down a little bit. I was after a show. I did a show at an arena [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7585.96s)]
*  in Florida. People were screaming. It's like 15,000 people, and I'm in the round, and they're laughing. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7591.799999999999s)]

*  the night, I was pretty tired. I was just beaten up from playing pool till 3.30 in the morning, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7609.48s)]
*  and then we were drinking. The next day, I was like, God, am I hungover? I feel like shit. Then [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7613.48s)]
*  it hit me. I did a show the next night with COVID. No problem. Killed. Had a great time. Yay. See you [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7617.879999999999s)]

*  I might have it. I feel kind of shitty. Then I woke up in the morning. I was sweating. I had a [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7630.919999999999s)]

*  oh, I feel pretty good. Then the day after that, I made that video. I was like, yeah, I'm all right. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7642.92s)]
*  Then they came for me. I was like, wow, you corrupt cocksuckers. You don't give a shit about health. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7649.0s)]
*  If you did, you would be saying, hey, look, this guy who's not young, who got COVID and is not [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7654.84s)]
*  vaccinated, got over it pretty quickly. Look, maybe it's not as bad as we think it is, or maybe [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7662.28s)]
*  it's not as bad if you're fit and healthy, or maybe there's some other options other than just [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7667.719999999999s)]
*  taking this experimental medication that's never been mass injected into hundreds of millions of [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7672.28s)]
*  people in this country. Yeah. But no, they were all corrupt because they're all a part of this [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7677.5599999999995s)]
*  industry that was relying on the advertising revenue from the pharmaceutical drug industry. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7683.48s)]
*  They were all in the pocket. Oh, yeah. They jumped in. Dirty people, man. Dirty, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7687.56s)]
*  dirty monsters. Yeah. They came for you. Most folks around the country, a lot of folks, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7692.04s)]
*  they don't speak publicly on it, but they saw that and knew exactly what it was. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7699.0s)]
*  Well, it killed their credibility. They're going for Joe. Then they just kept moving on. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7703.240000000001s)]
*  They never tune in anyways to watch him. Well, there's a lot of people now that will watch [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7708.200000000001s)]
*  those news reports on things, especially medical things, and go, hmm, how much you tell them the [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7712.92s)]
*  truth? How much you tell them? How come you guys are ignoring all the deaths? How come you guys [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7718.2s)]
*  aren't talking at all about the vaccine deaths? How come you guys aren't talking at all about the [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7722.599999999999s)]
*  all-cause mortality spike that's unprecedented? How come you're not talking about that? Are you [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7726.679999999999s)]
*  guys the news? Are you guys some corporate mouthpiece for some company that pays you [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7731.719999999999s)]
*  exorbitant amounts of money to push their shit? Because that's what it seems like. And if that's [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7737.08s)]
*  the case, somebody should probably step in and regulate you cocksuckers. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7741.48s)]
*  I just watched the Netflix short series on Painkiller. Oh my God. I just saw that. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7746.28s)]
*  And that affected West Virginia big time. Big time. And there was a dramatization of the [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7753.4s)]
*  bullet points of what happened there. Yeah, it's a broken system. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7764.28s)]
*  Well, they're monsters, man. They don't care about death. They care about profit. And that is their [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7769.08s)]
*  business. Their business is making money. I mean, there's the people that make the medication, [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7774.36s)]
*  and their business is just to make effective medication. They're scientists. And then there's [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7779.0s)]
*  the people that are just money people. And their business is to sell it and sell it as hard as they [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7782.92s)]
*  can. And they're incentivized, especially the Sackler family. I mean, that family is still [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7787.48s)]
*  not in jail. How are they not in jail? And they spent six, they gave up $6 billion to try to [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7793.16s)]
*  avoid prosecution. But then the Netflix special, the series came out. And when that series came out, [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7799.88s)]
*  I believe there was a judge that put a hold on the decision to allow them to have immunity. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7806.28s)]
*  And they're like, hang on, hang the fuck on. What did you do? And when you see what they did, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7812.92s)]
*  I had Peter Berg on who made that series. He's amazing. And he explained it, what they did. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7820.12s)]
*  And he went into even more depth, like things he couldn't cover in the series. And it's terrible. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7826.76s)]
*  It's terrible, awful, evil, demonic behavior. That set off a chain reaction that affected [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7835.24s)]
*  a whole generation. And so many people died, but the people that didn't die, how many lives are [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7842.12s)]
*  ruined? In my family, I have people whose lives were ruined. Multiple people in my immediate, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7847.24s)]
*  in my close family, and my connected family. I know many people who just got devastated by that [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7853.719999999999s)]
*  shit. And they're still struggling to this day to try to get off of it. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7861.0s)]
*  The kids that grew up in my grade, we lost, I think, one or two to a couple accidents. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7867.719999999999s)]
*  And then one to cancer, and then the rest are all as a result of that. It's ended up ODing. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7874.2s)]
*  Did you ever see, there's a real good documentary on Huntington, West Virginia. I think it was called [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7883.88s)]
*  Heroin. And it's just like following around the fire chief of Huntington. And she's just going [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7889.96s)]
*  around just person. This is just like a day in the life. And she's just going from person to person. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7898.04s)]
*  ODing. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7903.08s)]
*  Apartment to house, just either saving somebody or finding somebody too late, just all day. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7903.5599999999995s)]
*  It's incredible. They did a good job of showing the reality of it and what it does. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7911.799999999999s)]
*  If you talk to EMTs, that shit is happening all over the country. All the country right now, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7916.44s)]
*  still to this day. And now, unfortunately, it's harder for people to get the real pills. So now [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7920.839999999999s)]
*  they're getting this cartel shit that's laced with fentanyl. And they're all fucking dying left [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7926.44s)]
*  and right. So many people are dying. It's a parent's worst nightmare. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7933.4s)]
*  Oh my God. It's so scary, man. At my comedy club, we had to start carrying Narcan. One of our [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7936.759999999999s)]

*  we haven't had to use it. We haven't had anybody overdose during a show, but we did have a lady [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7951.96s)]
*  go into a K-hole. She was taking ketamine. This fucking people that are recreationally taking [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=7956.36s)]

*  But John Lilly used to do with intramuscular ketamine. So he would inject his thigh with a [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=8023.56s)]
*  blast of ketamine and then lie down and just go into this other dimension and communicate with [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ils46iDwU-c&t=8029.88s)]
