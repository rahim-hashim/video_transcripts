# Joe Rogan Experience #1382 - RZA & Donnell Rawlings
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 12, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDzDNcglUdo)
*  Boom, okay. So now that I'm the producer of the Don L Rawlings podcast.
*  We already established that.
*  We established that.
*  Yes.
*  We've taken off the RZA, sir. Thank you for being here.
*  Thank you. I'm going to give him a beat.
*  Man!
*  He's going to be, you're going to have music.
*  It's going to be hip hop.
*  From Hip Hop Royalty.
*  Yo, first off, when you said that, I'm saying I got a button down too. Don't just assume
*  it's all hip hop. That was insulting. You know, not hip hop.
*  I would love any genre, if you have a vision or you see or even connected to this at all,
*  whatever you feel, I fucking got to feel it. And I'll make it work.
*  I think your idea of driving around talking shit is a great one. I like when Bill Burr
*  did a podcast doing that. He basically did like these little video things doing that.
*  But driving with Don L is a great idea. Or even just, don't limit it. Do whatever the
*  fuck you want. One day you want to drive, drive. One day you want to sit in your living
*  room, just talk shit in your living room. Do that.
*  Today was a good day for me because I knew it was coming to do your show. And I've been
*  ducking the question and evading it for so long when I see you, I can't even be real
*  with you like I want to. And I was like, I said, fuck man, I'm doing Rogan in two hours.
*  I got to go do a podcast.
*  What are you writing?
*  I was just writing podcasts because I don't know if he's on a podcast or a podcast.
*  P.O.D.
*  P.O.D.
*  I know. So I'm just kind of, you know, I'm just taking notes.
*  Yeah. Yo, yo. It's just going to be like, it's just going to be, I wanted Joe to stop
*  bullying me. I didn't want him to talk shit. Because every time I see him, every time I
*  see him, he be like this, we have a regular conversation. Then he just start doing like
*  this. I'm like, this nigga about to hit me, right? He say, he say, what's up with the
*  podcast? We going to shoot that shit to the moon.
*  Come on, man.
*  He start doing this.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's that high school vibe.
*  I'm just trying to get him enthusiastic. I'm like, you're too good. You're too good to
*  not have a podcast.
*  He said, do this. And I said, and I'm going to tell you, I could go in front of thousands
*  and thousands of people. I ain't tripping off that shit. But it was just something about
*  me talking to myself, talking to myself. I never did that. 44 minutes.
*  Yeah.
*  You ever talk to yourself?
*  You know what? You got to talk to yourself.
*  But I never did it.
*  But you know what? You got to start, bro.
*  Let me say, I got to say this. No, the real talk. Today, I've been talking to Joe, no
*  bullshit. I've been talking to Joe about this shit for five months. We talk about it. People
*  been his fans talking about it. And I ain't going to front. I was a little nervous about
*  it. And I was like, ah, ah, ah. And then when I did it today, when I finished it, I felt
*  good as shit, son.
*  See what I mean?
*  I felt like this. I was like, oh, it's about to be on, son.
*  It's on. See? We just had to get moving. That's all you needed. You just needed a launch.
*  They podcast off with Joe Rogan, producer, and a RZA producer.
*  And Jamie Vernon doing the check of the difficulties.
*  Jamie was mad at me at first, though. Jamie went trying to help me. Oh, Joe, I was trying
*  to be calm. I'm trying to talk like a white person, Joe. I'm talking like a white person.
*  Yo, I didn't want to throw the child in. He wanted me to say, fuck it then, right? I was
*  trying to figure it out. And I said, OK, Jamie, you're absolutely right. I agree with you
*  100%. But I said, what can I do to help me and you?
*  We're going to make it happen.
*  And we worked it out. He didn't want to turn my internet on. He was like, he didn't want
*  to put me on line or nothing, son.
*  There's a couple of companies that offer like a turnkey sort of situation. What is the one
*  who does Eric Weinstein's podcast and does Google that? They have a service. They have
*  a company and they just they get all the ads for you and they take a certain percent and
*  then they set up a studio for you. You don't have to think about shit. You just go in and
*  be yourself.
*  We know it's crazy. Not that I'm jumping on Donnell's bandwagon right here.
*  You can't tell what's wrong with that.
*  I'm not used to that. I'm not used to jumping on bandwagons. But let me just say, maybe
*  for the last few months, since we started the Hulu, the American Saga series, people
*  been pushing me to do a podcast.
*  They would love listening to you.
*  I end up not doing one, but we have one for the show, of course, that kind of does, you
*  know, like after the show goes on, you can go and listen and hear more inside details
*  of the story. But still, during that process, it was like, you need to do a podcast, whereas
*  because just the way you think, you just need more people with that kind of thinking. So
*  when he just said that he talked to us, he don't talk to himself, but then after he was
*  finished talking to himself for 44 minutes, he felt a weight come off him.
*  I was, son.
*  But there's a scripture on that, bro.
*  What is it?
*  The scripture is in the Bhagavad Gita.
*  Is that the Quran?
*  No.
*  No.
*  I don't know.
*  I know the Quran is the Quran.
*  All right. I just need to know.
*  So the Bhagavad Gita means the song of God. Just put G-I-T-A, Gita. The Gita, right? It's
*  actually the words of Krishna. And he says, contemplation with yourself, which is talking
*  with yourself, will take you further than praying.
*  Ooh.
*  Okay? And if a man is not contemplating, right? If you're not, whether you're doing it verbally,
*  like right now we're talking out loud, we all got that voice in our head. You had that
*  voice, you was like, yo, I put the condom on and that.
*  I don't want to get joined at that loud no more, though. I feel you. I've been there.
*  You had that voice. And if you listen to it, you don't listen to it. But the bottom line
*  is that, according to Krishna, it's that contemplation that makes us better. It's that reflection
*  of what we did, what we're going to do. And when you verbalize it even out loud, I mean,
*  the spoken word, it's even more powerful.
*  You get it out. That's how I felt. But I'm telling you, part of it was like I was not
*  letting Joe talk shit to me. I was like, fuck that, man. He not doing that. But I'm glad
*  I did it, man.
*  The Bhagavad Gita did not reach him.
*  Yeah, you got to do a podcast, son.
*  You should.
*  Son, son, son, son.
*  They get mad money, too, son.
*  You can make money.
*  What?
*  But the most important thing is that you have a voice. You're an interesting guy. If you
*  did a podcast, it would be interesting. It's good to have a bunch of different people doing
*  it from all different styles of art, different walks of life.
*  If a person has already been interested, people, for one, people want to keep getting different
*  pieces of you. How can you give it to them?
*  Dude, they would love to hear you just talk about life.
*  Come on, man. That's a fucking...
*  Easy. That's a no brainer. You hear a quote in the Bhagavad Gita. It's you and Duncan
*  Trussell, the only people who quote the Bhagavad Gita. That's hilarious.
*  I love that book.
*  Oh, that's an amazing book, man. That's what Oppenheimer quoted when he watched the first
*  atomic bomb blow off. Said, I am become death, destroyer of worlds. A quote right from the
*  Bhagavad Gita. That's crazy shit.
*  That's a damn...
*  Yeah. That is a fascinating book, man. There's all sorts of allusions to UFOs and shit.
*  I was about to say that you talk about the Maharada, which is a longer version. The Bhagavad
*  Gita is about 700 verses that's taken out of the Maharada, which is one of the longest...
*  It's not the longest poem, but it's in the top 10.
*  How do you say it? Is it Mahabharata? How do you say it?
*  Yeah. That B is in there. I don't know if that B is silent.
*  Yeah, that's the one without the...
*  I don't even know where it's got a silent B.
*  Mahabharata. That's crazy stories.
*  What word has a silent B? I never even know that was where it existed.
*  Mahabharata. A silent B? No. That's got a B in there. That B makes noise. But there's
*  Vimanas in that, right? Where there's flying crafts. There's a bunch of weird shit that
*  people throughout history have tried to figure out. What the fuck are they talking about?
*  Yeah. That ancient civilization was measuring what they call coppers every 35,000 years.
*  They were saying...
*  Measuring coppers?
*  Yeah. No. That's like K-A-P-P-A. Like Capadonna.
*  Oh. Oh.
*  I got a tendency to... I want to just make a disclaimer real quick. I have a tendency
*  to pronounce words the way I pronounce them.
*  I have a tendency to listen and understand the words the way you pronounce them, son.
*  Words to everything I love, my nigga.
*  So, you got it.
*  Yo, wait a minute. Can I say this real quick?
*  I forgot this one. I did my show earlier, right, son? Joe said he never spit a 16, son?
*  Oh, you never spit a 16?
*  No, I didn't. I'm very white.
*  Eight?
*  No. No, man. I didn't even know what he was talking about. I had to go over it with him.
*  Tell him the bars you said you spit.
*  I said hip hop, hip to the...
*  Oh, he was in the classic.
*  He was asking me about Sugar Hill and I said, yeah, I remember that. And then I started singing it.
*  I don't think I was actually about Sugar Hill, son.
*  I think we talked about it.
*  No, no, no. I wish I could remember exactly.
*  Didn't we? I think you did.
*  We went to Sugar Hill after a period of time.
*  Yeah, you asked me if I knew.
*  No, no. This is what I said. You ever spit 16? You was like... This is what you told me, Joe.
*  You said, I don't have time to spit 16.
*  No, I don't have any time to rap.
*  This is what you said. No, you said I have much better things.
*  I said I enjoy it?
*  You said, Joe, you said...
*  I enjoy listening to it. I don't have time to do it.
*  I don't have much better things to do my time to spit 16.
*  I don't think that's what I said.
*  I'm pretty sure that's what you said.
*  What I said was, I'm too busy to do one more thing.
*  And I like rap, but I don't like to do it.
*  Maybe I would love it, but I'm not going to.
*  I don't have any time.
*  That's all it means.
*  That's all it means.
*  Don't try to twist it, Tom.
*  I didn't twist it. Tape speaks for itself.
*  I am the producer of your show.
*  And you are treating me like a terrible man.
*  I'm fired already.
*  You're going to edit it out.
*  Let's edit this.
*  We were talking about how few white rappers ever actually make it.
*  The tiny percentage in comparison to the ones who try it.
*  How many of them try it?
*  You've got to think there must be millions and millions that have tried it.
*  Right?
*  This is like a small handful of guys.
*  Well, in all reality, it's a small handful.
*  Period.
*  That's true too.
*  So if you look at the ratio, I'm a ratio guy.
*  So as we talk, you'll see I'm always pulling some numbers into things.
*  But I'm not always pulling some numbers into things.
*  I'm always pulling some numbers into things.
*  But if you look at the ratio, let's say 1 million white guys tried.
*  5 made it.
*  Let's say 50 million blacks tried.
*  So it's usually the ratio.
*  Right.
*  Many more are doing it.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  Makes sense.
*  But hip hop, let me just say something about hip hop.
*  Because I can say that, right?
*  It's dead?
*  No.
*  I was just checking.
*  I was like, you killed it.
*  Tekashi tried to kill it.
*  But go ahead and say it.
*  The beautiful thing is that hip hop is really one of those.
*  No, he did.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I like this energy here.
*  But hip hop is a pure American culture.
*  Creation?
*  Yes.
*  People try to trace it.
*  No, man.
*  Trace it right here.
*  And when it was formed, it's definitely a lot of young black men.
*  You go back to Kool Hoke and Grandmaster Flash and Melly Mel and Spoonie G.
*  You can go back to the classes.
*  Grandmaster Kaz.
*  But within Grandmaster Kaz crew, the Co-Crust brother, you got Charlie Chase.
*  So you got the Spanish brothers there.
*  Within our first hip hop songs that we love, LL Cool J, Rock the Bells.
*  Oh, guess who produced that?
*  Rick Rubin.
*  Got the White brother there.
*  Oh yeah, we was talking about that.
*  So the youth culture of America at that time, even with Fab Five Freddy going down town to the CBGB crowd and all that.
*  And Blondie and all these things was melding from our culture.
*  Now whereas of course, it's dominantly a black expression.
*  We can say we dominated the culture.
*  But it took angles from every other part of New York to make it exist.
*  And that means it took our Spanish brothers and their culture, it took our white brothers and their culture to all form it.
*  And then of course when Wu-Tang came, we brought the Asian culture in.
*  Wu-Tang, when you say that, it came in like a thunderstorm.
*  It came in like, whoo!
*  So we should be proud to know that it's an inclusive American art form.
*  It is.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And look, Bruce Lee, who was an American, he represents the Asian culture, but he was born in America.
*  Went back, made it big in Hong Kong, then came back to America and took it to the next level again.
*  And when you look at some of those breakdance moves and some of the philosophies that he brought to mixing more styles together.
*  You know, G-Kun Do, which means the way of the intercepting fist, or also the way of he combined boxing with fencing with Wing Chung.
*  Yes.
*  He put all those MMAs together before it was even that.
*  When it was taboo.
*  Exactly.
*  Hip-hop also is that same type of product.
*  When you do have the soul of James Brown, the jazz of the Loneliest Monk, you know what I mean?
*  The rock beat of Billy Squire.
*  Yeah.
*  I got a big beat.
*  Or Honky Tonk, Womba My Rolling Stones.
*  Those are break beats.
*  But yet you also got the Latin feeling of the Mambo Kings and songs like Apache and the Mexican.
*  Do you think hip-hop is evolving?
*  Is it evolving in a sense of the creativity of it?
*  I think it's definitely evolving.
*  Because people, they got a situation now where it don't have to evolve.
*  People have found a way to make money off of something that people may not agree with.
*  It's like hot.
*  But do you think hip-hop is evolving?
*  Yes.
*  It always evolves.
*  Right?
*  Part of the evolution we're seeing now is whereas we, in my generation, we relied on
*  music that was created before us because we came in a time when they took music programs
*  out of school.
*  Right?
*  So you didn't learn how to play a guitar, piano.
*  And your music equipment or your instrument became your turntables.
*  It became your drum machine.
*  Right.
*  Eventually became our sampler.
*  And then we sampled a lot of songs, a lot of breaks from old records that already existed.
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  But this generation, they're not actually forced to sample.
*  They actually could take their keyboard, their drum machine, their laptop and just create.
*  And on their phone too.
*  Yeah.
*  And on their phone and just create the beat.
*  Right?
*  And so now the beat has no historical reference to it in the sense of, oh, that was a James
*  Brown sample.
*  That was a Marvin Gaye sample.
*  No.
*  It's just that kid who, whether he did Fruity Loops and threw some chord progressions together
*  or whether he sat there on his garage band on his phone and hit the guitar program that
*  comes with it or whatever, the creativity of it is now having this form of originality.
*  Right?
*  Now, of course, once something like that happens, there's a formula.
*  So we keep hearing that same formula exists right now.
*  I think one of the greatest evolution of hip hop, right, is, and I'm going to use the word
*  evolution loosely because when I think about the Cold Crush Brothers and the 4seMDs, they
*  did this anyway in the beginning.
*  But hip hop has become more melodic now than it did in the 90s and the early 2000s.
*  Right?
*  So what I mean by that, you know, rappers now, you know, you know, I'm just so D, yeah,
*  like it's all melody.
*  It's all, you know, it's all chanting, right?
*  It has the reggae chant vibe to it.
*  When we was doing it, I smoke on the mic like Smoke and Joe Frazier, the hell, Lisa.
*  It was all aggressive chop rap, you know what I mean?
*  So to see that it evolves to this melodic form and then look at Kanye, he's now took
*  it to gospel.
*  It's melodic as hell right now.
*  Snoop took it to the Snoop Lion.
*  Snoop was really successful.
*  The Snoop Lion thing wasn't that successful, but the one he won, the gospel album, I think
*  he was getting awards and nominated and stayed on top of Billboard for a while.
*  Yeah, and now Kanye is in that world.
*  So it's evolving, right?
*  The church is even different now.
*  You got a fucking pussy eating preachers now.
*  What you mean now?
*  No, I'm just saying like viral.
*  No, I'm just saying, no, I'm sorry.
*  I didn't know.
*  What's going on?
*  I didn't know.
*  They had this one, you didn't hear about this, son?
*  You know what's going on?
*  No, no, I don't know exactly what's going on.
*  Say it again slow, brother.
*  The pussy eating preacher.
*  What is that?
*  A pep?
*  Jamie, Google it.
*  Google it, son.
*  It was like, I'm pretty sure preachers were eating pussy for a while, but this one got
*  caught on camera and he went viral, son.
*  I'm Pornhub?
*  It's not Pornhub.
*  No, no, no.
*  Is that real?
*  Yeah, it looks like it.
*  Yo, it's real.
*  Okay.
*  And then women doing little signs like, if you was on a deserted island, who would you
*  want to be?
*  And they got somebody else, they got somebody else, and they got the pep eating preacher.
*  And people go, I know this guy is disgusting.
*  Where's he from?
*  From New York?
*  I don't know.
*  He's from down south.
*  They on God hard down there.
*  They on God hard?
*  They on God hard.
*  They on God hard, son.
*  They out of North Carolina, South Carolina.
*  Oh, there he is.
*  Oh, Jesus, Jamie.
*  That's him right there.
*  They say he's speaking something.
*  I don't want to see that.
*  Oh, wait, that's the pussy cats.
*  Yeah, they blocked it all out with pussy cats so that you can't see the pussy.
*  Yeah, and it's too popular.
*  I'm a little naive.
*  It's the internet guy.
*  It's the internet kids, these wacky kids, they love cats.
*  And this guy's conjugation is going up.
*  Well, it's going up.
*  People are dissing it.
*  They're like, look at God, what he doing?
*  Girls like getting their pussy eaten.
*  It's a fact.
*  Listen, nothing wrong, listen, man.
*  That's one thing about sex.
*  Can I use a little more scientific word here?
*  Please.
*  Cunnilingus.
*  Man, I know, all right.
*  I feel you, but nah, but go ahead.
*  Listen, but you just like you said earlier, you're going to speak the way you normally
*  talk.
*  Yeah.
*  So, cunnilingus.
*  This is my daily conversation.
*  Okay?
*  No, but cunnilingus is, look, it's fellatio or whatever you guys want to do.
*  This is part of sex.
*  So it is what it is, right?
*  And of course, everybody likes it.
*  Everybody likes sex.
*  Listen, I don't think you're going to find a species that don't like sex.
*  You can see two flies on top of each other.
*  You ever see two flies?
*  Snatch it.
*  They smash it.
*  Yeah, in the air.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Go and do it verticals too.
*  You ever see eagles do it?
*  They have to fly through the air and they almost crash to the ground while they're fucking
*  because they kind of like run out of space.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And the guy's trying to nut on the way down.
*  If they don't make it, sometimes they'll bounce off trees and shit.
*  You ever seen it?
*  You should watch Eagles Fuck.
*  Jimmy Schubert used to have a great bit about it.
*  I don't know if he still has it, but he had a great bit about eagles.
*  Eagles Fuck is the name of a band.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the name of a band.
*  Eagles Fuck.
*  Do they go to sleep afterwards?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know a whole lot about it, but I remember learning about it from a Jimmy Schubert bit.
*  Yeah, this is them fucking.
*  They fuck and they just lock up until he gets it off.
*  She's like, no, let go.
*  You're not going to come.
*  He's like, I'm going to get it off.
*  Damn, he focused.
*  You know what I like about that?
*  Those are American Eagles right there.
*  They are.
*  American's fuck taking a big risk for cum.
*  I mean, this is bananas.
*  This is the real thing.
*  And then apparently they'll disjoin.
*  With no emotions.
*  Look at his face though.
*  He had that face like, you saw what I did to that, wasn't it?
*  No emotion involved with that at all.
*  It's a terrible animal to have as our national animal.
*  It's a raptor, a vicious raptor that doesn't give a fuck about anything.
*  But when that motherfucker spread his wings, that look is like, you know what I'm saying?
*  That look and flying is what gives it that.
*  It's good if you want the world to be scared of you.
*  Yeah.
*  You definitely want to eat.
*  An eagle is a good one.
*  A good one.
*  I mean, one of the forms of kung fu that I had to learn is the eagle claw.
*  Which is a very good thing.
*  If you want me to show you.
*  Nah man, you ain't got no moves on me man.
*  I know you Wu-Tang wherever you're at.
*  Don't bitch me out of that.
*  When did you get into kung fu movies?
*  Wow.
*  I got into those.
*  I saw my first kung fu movie I think at the age of nine.
*  That was probably only my third movie experience.
*  Only because you know.
*  Now they need to see movies anywhere.
*  Back then in the early 70s.
*  You had to go somewhere.
*  You had to go somewhere and listen.
*  You had to have a tape.
*  No, no, no tape.
*  VHS.
*  No, no this was before VHS.
*  I'm talking about going to the movies.
*  And actually seeing the shit.
*  My first movie, let me give you a little movie history for the reason.
*  First movie I ever saw was Huckleberry Finn.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  Down south my cousin took me to the movies.
*  I was maybe six or seven years old.
*  Second time to the movie theater.
*  Second time.
*  My uncle Hollis took me.
*  It was a double feature.
*  It was Star Wars and The Swarm.
*  Right?
*  And listen to how all this stuff affects my life.
*  The Killer Bees, The Swarm, Wu-Tang Killer Bees.
*  Right.
*  Third time to the movie theater.
*  Right?
*  Or third or fourth time.
*  Because I saw Rocky and then I saw a double feature.
*  Then Bruce Lee, which is called Fervor the Dragon.
*  And another movie called Black Samurai starring Jim Kelly.
*  Oh man that was the shit.
*  And once I saw that.
*  Yo that niggas fucking motherfuckers.
*  Oh shit.
*  He was a bad pre with fucking bitches and everything.
*  Go ahead.
*  Once I saw that I was hooked on the action kung fu movies.
*  What?
*  Okay.
*  And then I saw.
*  As a double feature you had to.
*  As a double feature.
*  That's like bam bam.
*  Ten to the age of nine.
*  And mind you.
*  That was the birth of Wu-Tang Clan.
*  And mind you back then to go to the movies.
*  My family didn't have the dollar 25.
*  Like to get the money to go to the movies.
*  That's a big deal.
*  It may take six months.
*  God damn.
*  And when we got to the movies.
*  I'm telling you this family, my family.
*  This is back when I was still eating meat, pork, swine.
*  We used to kill the pig.
*  We used to raise them, name them, kill them, eat them.
*  So now I'm in New York City living with my grandmother.
*  Send me the movies.
*  Rocky's playing.
*  Everybody's coming to see Rocky.
*  We gotta bring our Sunday dinner to the theater with us.
*  Oh nigga.
*  And yo and my grandma.

*  She stuffed pig feets in there.
*  Collard greens, potato salad.
*  Joe you would never know this Joe.
*  Wow.
*  In the movies.
*  In the movies.
*  All the people who got popcorn, goobers.
*  They let you bring it in?
*  Back in those days.
*  But you know what?
*  You would sneak it in too.
*  Yeah you had a big bag.
*  You knew what a big bag was.
*  Nobody was thirsty.
*  One motherfucker might get a soda.
*  They was like this.
*  They'd share it.
*  Like yo let me tell you something.
*  We walked for years, I walked right past all the concessions.
*  Everything.
*  Popcorn, hot dogs, Twizzlers.
*  Never had no money for that shit.
*  I walked straight in the theater.
*  Yeah I'm with him.
*  Because listen, think about a dollar for a snicker.
*  You couldn't even get a snicker when it was $40.
*  Nope.
*  Like you used to ask our parents, hey mom you got 25 cents?
*  What you say?
*  Boy I ain't got good cents.
*  I ain't got no cents.
*  I ain't got good cents boy.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So we from that era.
*  But at the end of the day though, those movie moments, you know what I mean?
*  They really inspired me.
*  Really took me to a world that was different from the project world that I lived in.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Once I started seeing movies like the Five Deadly Venoms and 36 Chambers and Mask Avengers
*  and Super Ninjas and all that.
*  When you start seeing those now, you're in the period.
*  And you're seeing all this action and it just starts resonating with me.
*  Maybe around the age of 14, I just ended right here, I won't talk the whole show of it.
*  But around the age of 14 I'm watching.
*  Niggas want to listen.
*  Yeah don't worry about it.
*  I'm watching.
*  Eating Cheetos and Tonic here?
*  Remember last time you gave me a drink.
*  Do you want a drink?
*  Yeah I'll take your Cheetos.
*  You don't drink right?

*  You say I'm a vegan, I don't drink.
*  Nah just ask your question.
*  Vegans don't do shit son.
*  Ain't no meat and vegan.
*  I didn't know when someone would be like what is the potato and then is it, I don't know
*  how you know.
*  They'd be like is it corn syrup, is this dehydrated, what's the origin of it?
*  I don't know.
*  There's a lot of wine that's not vegan apparently.
*  Yeah they put egg whites in a lot of wine.
*  Is that what they do?
*  Egg whites.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.

*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  So you give a fuck about how chickens are slaughtered and shit is the reason?
*  Yeah, to be honest with you bro, I just hit you with this right here.
*  The reality is how I feel.
*  No animal needs to die for me to live.
*  My son turned 14 this year, never had a piece of meat in his life.
*  Okay, you go do eight pull-ups right now. Okay, my oldest son
*  Having had me in his life
*  He could bench over 200 pounds. Okay
*  Six to eight pack
*  Play good guitar piano
*  Great memory. He never had no hot dogs and I never had a hot
*  Dog
*  We never tell you never ever had a hot dog. How is he 18 listen? How is he 18 21 21?
*  He never said listen. Okay, if he had a hot dog was a vegan hot dog
*  Not over grandma house or nothing. Nah
*  Nah whiskey
*  The point being made to you right bro is that
*  I'm only saying that to say that I got I could look at my household as a living example that you don't need
*  I'm with you that deliver. I'm mad. I'm not arguing whatever because I'm especially so now I talk shit about vegans and shit
*  I talk shit about plant-based motherfuckers, but I know now like what the way people cook it and
*  The more options is more options to eat like that than it was when I was coming when I was coming up
*  It was just like that Sunrise Patty
*  That's the only vegetarian and they can tell you eat some broccoli or carrots or something
*  but it wasn't no options and and it wasn't so many people doing it where
*  You you wasn't finding no vegan restaurant you like it would be one spot
*  You got a way to go way over here
*  You go to a Jamaican spot in Brooklyn
*  If you was vegetarian you had that one steam pot and they had to mix vegetables
*  That's the only thing you was gonna get they didn't have no meat in it. Yeah, I was a budget
*  I became vegetarian so me and odb
*  Yeah, man, why you switch on me, but I do it you get that yes, Jamie wants to get the Tito's your Tito's man
*  You got him we got
*  What I gotta do what I gotta do I could like and plus I ain't really see my son that much what I gotta do
*  I could do it anytime tomorrow. I'm going to see somebody I could be there four hours later
*  I need to get some time my son and I'm chilling here. So I know I ain't get invited but
*  You're here so did you when did you stop eating meat? How many years has been I haven't had a piece of red meat

*  No offense on this man. Why you keep
*  This don't work on him, all right, but every time you say something to me you said it like before you start tripping out
*  I'm gonna say something to you gentlemen, but all right, this is for you. Okay. No, no, it has dark chocolate in it
*  Okay, so dark chocolate is known to reduce high blood pressure right us as black men
*  We're you know, they say we have high blood pressure, right based
*  Based on us being in America not getting that real
*  Natural son right and having a high sodium diet. I understand blood pressures dark chocolate helps reduce it
*  So this is good for me. Yes, it's good for everybody
*  But why you got just directed at me like I need dark chocolate. Well, brother
*  I'm just saying I don't even know why you feel like I needed the dark chocolate. I don't know
*  You know what I just mix no
*  No, I'm just saying you keep pointing at me and shit, I'm sorry
*  I like dark chocolate like everybody else like dark chocolate. You like milk chocolate or dark chocolate. I like dark chocolate

*  Yo channel. No, it's a maybe it's a history channel one of them stations, but they go into the
*  Hershey company
*  The same people did the men that made America. Yeah, it's a need docu-series
*  I didn't know I didn't see that one, but that right that one about the men that made America
*  Yeah, I gotta watch it good. You know, they cover Kellogg's they covered Kellogg's. Yo, check out how Kellogg's start
*  Yo, I got a story for you to tell a story about how I got here. You know why black people like Pepsi?
*  But hold on let him tell the Kellogg story cuz you know, I'm gonna believe this okay
*  Kellogg's star because he's a doctor with a little us they call it sanitary. What they call it sanitarium. Yeah
*  We had
*  I pronounce the words wrong whatever it is. Wait, he's a doctor. Yeah, no sanitarium. There are just battle Creek sanitarium
*  Yeah, so he's there. I never knew that motherfucker
*  motherfucker that Kellogg
*  I
*  Did not know Kellogg was a motherfucker do he invented cereal to keep people from having sex and beat my
*  He's got a serial boxes forever. He invented cereal to calm people's sexual desire
*  Yeah
*  And that's diet because they because they because they they were sick there and they thought the best way to get the nutrients
*  He would bake all this grain together and then break it up and so no, no, he didn't pour milk his brother
*  Actually was the one that was like
*  So Kellogg's is doing this shit his brothers like yo listen man, it's money in this we could sell this but Kellogg's
*  He's the doctor. He's already making money. He's like, nah, man. Look his brother's little dyslexia
*  He ain't really kind of got it together. He's telling his brother
*  Look, we ain't doing all that son. Let's go to work and do what I tell you, right?
*  Right, so he's going to work do what he tells him and then one guy comes over to the sanitarium
*  No money can't afford to pay he has to work it off, right? So they let him work it off, right?
*  He's working he's eating the cereal every morning and he's just checking out the sanitarium and he goes he looks around
*  His name is mr. Post mr. Post. Yeah, huh? He leaves the sanitarium and
*  Before Kellogg starts Kellogg's cereal
*  Mr. Post started post cereal only
*  I forgot about post yo for real. It wasn't beef was they had like cereal beef
*  Oh, it was so real beef for the whole like
*  It's not
*  Pepsi-Cola right you asked yourself black people love Pepsi-Cola, right? I was talking this white do one time
*  He said you know why black people like pepsi. I'm saying you try and be racist
*  Right and he explained story to me back in like the 30s when coca-cola and Pepsi was the two vine
*  bottling companies and
*  Coca-cola was smashing Pepsi on sales like like 125 minutes like 3 million in sales per year
*  Right and Pepsi needed to do something to get a different audience. So Pepsi painted
*  basically coke to be either racist or not really caring about the black community and Pepsi was the first
*  Corporation that started putting black people on the cover of the posters and
*  Do being a fluent like like doctors nurses
*  They because everything you saw was like and your mami ship
*  Pepsi was the first ones to start doing that and Pepsi hired an ad agency 12 black guys
*  I think was in Louisiana to go out and do juke joints and touch the black community and what Pepsi did was like
*  Quantity wise like say if you had 10 ounces of Pepsi 10 ounce of coke
*  Pepsi coke would charge like 20 cent and Pepsi would charge like 10 cent
*  But basically you can double what you want you give a nigga sugar. It don't matter you can charge it up, right?
*  Yeah, so that's the reason and then if you think about that through generations generation
*  That's the reason why a person could be disconnected from a certain brand
*  You said think about it if you if you like if you at home, right?
*  You got Pepsi coke and then you hear somebody say man, we don't drink that coke man
*  That's how white people sold it. You know, you won't drag it in and that's what I did and they it's a book called
*  It's called it's a book called the real Jamie pop it up the real Pepsi challenge the real
*  Pepsi challenge. That's interesting. I'm gonna I think this would be I
*  Looked into trying to get the rights to of some kind of way I got blocked early on
*  Maybe I had a right juetang playing on my team
*  How one pioneering company broke the color barrier in 1940s American businesses
*  Wow and say that you wouldn't see him back then you wasn't seeing posters of
*  Of a working mom you were just seeing like serving and stuff
*  And that's when is that audio version of that book about
*  That's a great story you could see the you could just see you really you could just see the outfits they was wearing and like
*  The Pepsi dudes they was a Pepsi mother. They was a Pepsi niggas
*  They were just to have money to go throw parties and shit
*  Yep, Pepsi it up pep it up. Do you know that Coca-Cola to this day is made with cocaine
*  Not to the day early on no
*  They make it with cocaine they use coca leaves and then they extract medical cocaine from that and then there's a company that makes
*  Yep
*  there's a company that extracts it for them and makes medical cocaine and they have they have
*  Coca-leaves that are shipped to coca-cola to make
*  Coca-cola there's a certain flavor that those coca leaves give it no cocaine anymore, right?
*  I thought it was the original coca leaves
*  No, but there's a company that's connected to it that actually uses those coca leaves and extracts the medical
*  There is medical cocaine like lidocaine. Yeah, they use it for different like surgeries and chill like that even in the house
*  Right. Well, yeah in the arm and arm in the series the food that made America they go into coca-cola
*  They can still buy coke and yo
*  But the inventor of coca-cola was hooked on
*  Oh
*  Co another drug. No, he was hooked on uh, I forgot you can look it up, right?
*  He's hooked on what's all the morphine?
*  He's hooked on morphine, right? So he's trying to counter it. He's trying to counter his cocaine basically
*  Oh my god, he's speed balling but but check it out, but the cocoa
*  The cocoa leaf by the cocoa plant was it's actually an African plant, you know, I mean we always think of it as being a
*  Colombian and
*  So it's like coffee how coffee all came from Ethiopia. It's that kind of party
*  Oh and they're going to it and he make he makes cocoa
*  he makes cocoa the cocoa plant and few other ingredients together and
*  And he made coca-cola. So he made a cocktail and up take off the morphine. Yeah, an original formula is still unknown
*  For go go. I mean, I mean imagine what it's not popularized coca-cola when it had cocaine in it. You like crack
*  Streets coked up
*  Really thirsty now he lit right now. Can you imagine what that was? What was the decision? Like when did they all get together?
*  Hey, we got to take the fucking cocaine out of coca-cola
*  When did they get together and take that out?
*  They did it for people like would had with did dental in this like issues with their mouth and stuff
*  I thought that was a check. Yeah, that's what lidocaine is. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, that's what what pop lidocaine lidocaine they use in surgery. Okay. Yeah when I had my deviated septum fix
*  I had a broken nose. They straighten it out and they flood it with lidocaine to numb it
*  It's like a cousin of cocaine. I yeah, it doesn't get you high
*  Makes you feel like shit it doesn't get you high but you feel like disconnected and weird
*  Like they gave me a pretty good dose when they fixed my nose and I remember I went to a restaurant
*  Like either that night or the day after I think it was that night and I was I was feeling terrible
*  Like I'm like, I don't I can't taste anything I feel shaky and weird like I'm not on cocaine
*  But it's like weird cuz do anything to your appetite or anything. Yeah, I didn't wasn't that hungry. Yeah fucked with me
*  It just made me feel shitty. I just felt like it felt like my heart was beating too fast
*  I felt weird, you know, just felt like something was off. It didn't make any sense
*  But they use it just to numb you up for surgeries. It's real common
*  Real common you've joined injuries and shit like that shoot you up with lidocaine
*  Before fights for what the numbing shit out of his shin and then start
*  Fuck you up
*  Couldn't feel a goddamn thing was all numbed up. Well, there's no lidocaine in this this is strictly no dry roasted macadamia nuts
*  No organic dark chocolate seed the nuts part is better on the back than the front right?
*  Yeah, at least we can chocolate cane syrup cocoa powder cocoa butter
*  So it's all good and dark chocolate stuff. Yeah, put this in my pocket. I'll take this take it
*  Don't you do it you put it on top of something? No, I just
*  Chew it right. Yeah, he do it hard. So like after
*  It just like just throw the thing squeeze the thing and just throw that shit
*  It's good. I noticed that you work out you are you working out? I don't work out you can work out here, too
*  I would like to produce your show
*  About the workout
*  Tell you everything happened for a reason day because I want to eat better cuz I'm tired of this motherfucker
*  Look at me like I eat all fucked up. You keep looking at me like let me explain something to you

*  How big that is but no it's not just the size of it. It's a really good sandwich
*  I believe it but I love when people do that. I make something that's just over the top now
*  What part is my starving me? Is that the cows ass?
*  Come on, man
*  A lot of meat is made from the legs the rumps, you know a lot of roasts
*  I mean you have a each slum Jim's. Yeah, it says right on it. It says beef lips. Mmm beef beef ass
*  Asshole beef heart hearts good for you
*  The real problem is really the preservatives and all the stuff they put in it to make sure you can roll it up in a fucking
*  Tube and stick it in a tray and let it sit there for weeks and months on end. It's meat
*  It's not supposed to sit there
*  Like I don't care how you seal it if you unless you're drying it out like beef jerky and then even beef jerky
*  It's got a shelf life
*  You make it last as long as it can for bacteria takes it over but it's a it's tissue
*  So they don't they that's why they would dry it, you know
*  They would dry meat so they can carry it with them on the road
*  But they didn't plan on it staying forever, you know, but it does it stays pretty long
*  But that's slim Jim's they add a bunch of stuff to those processed ones. I had some turkey jerky or somewhere from somewhere
*  I thought it was whack, but it was pretty good some turkey jerky
*  I'm not a fan of turkey. It's a weird choice for food. It's like chicken tastes better
*  Well for black people turkey anything feels like you just cleanse yourself
*  Your first turkey break you like oh I didn't even know this part of life existed sir. Hmm
*  Then you have people competing who makes the best turkey burger you a good turkey burger can change your life
*  It could get me on the road of being a vegetarian. Well, you know what? That's the path I took I started first
*  I stopped red meat and then I went to actually
*  Toki burgers to keep a stormy toki toki chopped meat for my spaghetti, you know
*  I mean and maybe chicken burgers and then one day I was eating like I when I was younger
*  I can knock out about 30 chicken wings, you know, I mean
*  Man, but one day he pointed me like that
*  anybody
*  Chicken wings, right? I can knock out 30 chicken wings 100%
*  so on up so on the on the
*  About the 29th chicken wing
*  My teeth hit hit the bone
*  King and my mind said no more dead bird
*  Really?
*  You in New York City
*  Well, all these pigeons flying around and here you are
*  Supposed to be an intelligent human being you eating on a dead bird
*  And I was like that sounds pretty stupid to me and I never ate it again. That's interesting
*  You know, it's funny is that pigeons were actually brought here for food. That's what's even ironic about it
*  Listen when mama's fried chicken Harlem fried chicken
*  next-door fried chicken
*  Brooklyn fried chicken. Remember we had the big chickens
*  It was crown fried chicken
*  Double crowns for our chicken all of the queens fried chicken
*  You had to get the hot wings
*  Cuz the hot wings they had to make a right on the spot
*  The other drinker be in the window for a long time matter what you got all of a sudden
*  Pigeon population I pay attention to this type of shit
*  Pigeon population in New York City, huh? Drive down. We was doing the movie ghost dog. We had to get pigeons from Jersey
*  Dog the
*  Drop down bro, and I was like yo dead bird. So so I never ate chicken again, but the pigeons are edible. They're good
*  It's called squab. That's what pigeon is the famous British name. Yeah, it's pigeons
*  Some on some menus they just call it pigeon
*  Anything outside chicken I feel thinking like you be calling anything but chicken
*  Do you know this some some birds are actually red meat like Sand Hill crane you ever see the sand?
*  They call it rib eye in the sky. It's crazy. You said this they eat it. It's like a red meat
*  The breast is a red meat. It looks like a steak from a crane from a crane
*  It's like a bird that flies in the sky giant ass fucking white bird flies in the sky. This is on a menu
*  Yeah, you could get it on some menus in Texas I believe but it's a wild game animal I would try
*  That's what it looks like. Look at it
*  It looks like a son. I know it looks like steak. That's sous vide my friend. That's your style sous vide
*  Something that's what it looks like you see the area. Yeah, crane
*  Actually is a good example of
*  relationships a crane
*  Will fly across the country or the world whatever
*  Go to the mating place with other homies at right. Hmm meet somebody
*  Fly home and when of age fly back to marry that dude and stay married for the whole life kid Wow
*  Unless somebody shoot him down and cook them really, you know, I mean
*  Together they don't try to read
*  That's crazy. They go back and find each other
*  Oh
*  You never see the happy-looking
*  I was forced into this crazy shit. You never seen a crane like go
*  Well, the one on kung fu apparently looked the kind of yeah, but cranes look like that
*  They look like they looking to wait be with somebody for that long. They want to get shot
*  Oh, I just want to be delicious. You said the heart of that thing is um red meat. No the breasts
*  That's what those images are that pull that image. That's all Sandhill crane breasts. Their breast is like a beef
*  Yes, but down the right to that on the bed looks like a rib eye steak
*  It's still at the grill marks George Foreman grill style grill marks
*  It's a grill marks. Yeah, George Foreman grill. That's the heart to do right? Yeah, I know so that's
*  They sell tofu with grill
*  Areas like a lot of people I don't care even though I go to vegan restaurants and be like
*  Vegan fish. Mm-hmm. Don't call it vegan fish. Oh, right. It's not fish, right?
*  It's just food if you want to say or whatever it is flavored like, you know
*  Like barbecue flavored chips or something like that. You could say
*  Flavored artificially flavored fish, but do you know the mind is not gonna respond like that
*  They got to do something to the mind and makes it still enticing. You know, I said yo, that's vegan
*  Fur ain't no such thing as vegan for but it's not such thing as vegan for but if you a vegan motherfucker
*  You're gonna buy that because you heard the word vegan fur. How about vegan leather?
*  Aviva a real better
*  It will work like that feather. It will work. How about that feather feather like feather feather
*  Instead of fur. Oh, you do know that's gonna sell right? How about that?
*  Like this a ver jacket right you remember pleather
*  Ver is good. Yeah pleather with plastic leather. Yeah. Yeah
*  Yo, you I'm telling you that should have blow up put the V or anything put the V on it. They're gonna buy it
*  They'll buy it Vic. Yeah, instead of chicken you put the V you put the V in there. It's big like oh you do that's
*  My question, right? You can tell the chicks you want this Vic
*  What this vacant?
*  What is Vic you what this Vic I
*  Put the V in it take the word vegan and make something outside of it. Don't tell me that you're giving me a
*  vegan steak
*  Mmm, it ain't a steak homie steak is a particular part of the animal
*  That's why we call it a steak the ham is a particular part of the animal. That's why it's called the hair
*  What do you think about you? I don't think they care about you a professional at being a vegan
*  I don't think they care about you as much as the dumb vegan
*  They want to drop people in
*  They want the dumb mother fucker. They want somebody fresh off of a hamburger, right? You know what I mean?
*  They don't want you. You got years. Get them with that impossible burger
*  Close enough. Exactly, son. Yeah
*  You like the impossible burger? I've never had it
*  But the good if you were trying to trick someone into being a vegan that would be the way to do it
*  You give them that and go look you could just start with this, you know, it tastes a lot like a burger
*  You miss burgers just go to this when you need a burger. Have you ever had one? No, I had one
*  The problem is it's a lot of oils. It's like it's very processed
*  I think if you're gonna eat vegan you can eat you should eat whole foods, but the person but I don't want you Joe
*  They want a motherfucker like me
*  I was like you like me
*  I'm not gonna think about saturated fats. I'm not gonna think about that shit
*  You know all that like you was y'all read that shit. Yeah, but for you tell a motherfucker
*  This burger is impossible because there's no meat in it and it's close to me
*  It's like even close and I've had that burger and I know it's probably get all the facts
*  She talked about but for a person that eats
*  And you'll be like this you keep telling yourself. Hold on. Nah, that shit tastes like me to know what someone told me
*  It's like a cafeteria high school cafeteria burger
*  Joe Joe guess what that was disgusting to you. I wanted that burger so bad. I miss high school cafeteria
*  Squirt that ketchup in there
*  That's what you said it does
*  It does now that I think about it. It is like a cafeteria. Well cafeteria burgers did weren't a hundred percent meat, right?
*  Yeah, even the early even early McDonald burgers. Yeah
*  Make sure right they just try to fill you up they're trying to save money and so it was good
*  But another thing what it did for me
*  When I ate the burger, it made me feel good
*  Eating a burger that I thought was all plant-based
*  Oh shit damn I could fuck with that fruit and vegetable them fruit and vegetables
*  Fuckers right
*  House, you know, I'm saying right wife to pull out one of them motherfucking impossible burgers beyond
*  But you had to be on the beyond what's above and beyond what's better the impossible or the beyond?
*  You don't want to eat me. They're both brands, but is it the same thing? It's the same concept, but it's different titles
*  It's like what's more delicious. Is it one more delicious? You got to ask different people
*  Well, let me say to me speak on it the impossible burger is only available in restaurants
*  Right, so you can't really get it in your crib, but the beyond burger you can get it
*  They have products they got a line of shit you go to Gelson's you can get your sausage you get beyond whatever
*  What do you think about lab created meats? They're on the verge and they've already created some they're on the verge being able to mass produce
*  like full
*  Meat that has never been in an animal. Well, that's weird. That's the matrix baby. What is the meat that never been an animal?
*  It's it's it's basically they've taken all the building blocks for meat and they've somehow or another
*  Let's let's Google how they do it before I butcher the actual explanation. I'm sitting here gonna make up
*  That's the matrix remember the matrix he was like yo, I was eating a steak
*  He's like I just want to be an important person it was but it wasn't he was like it's not a real steak
*  It's just right, but this is a real steak
*  This has all the nutrition of a real steak, but it's not a real steak, right?
*  But it is actual flesh. It just was never connected to a living organism
*  No, it's actual flesh like it has the
*  Essential amino acid profile of steak, but it has nothing to do with an actual organism like it's never been alive
*  It's not like you killed it to make it
*  There's some process by which they are able to create this that I don't understand and we're trying to figure out what it is
*  Yeah, but they
*  This is it you got a good point you got a good point because we don't know what the fuck is gonna happen to people
*  I can't see Joe all that shit is man. They're doing that shit already
*  Not really this is a different thing this is a different thing and what this is is is
*  Meat without death and I don't know if it's real
*  I'm sorry. I know it's real in the sense that they they've done it, right?
*  I don't know if they can mass produce it. I don't know if it's viable and I don't know where they get it
*  I don't understand how the process starts, but I'm so motherfucking confused
*  but if you could have it with no ethical moral or health consideration if
*  if they figure out how to do it because meat
*  Essentially is a bunch of molecules. It's a bunch of particles
*  It's a bunch of things put together as people get more and more intelligent and they have more and more control over their environment
*  They're gonna get to a point where they can recreate all life
*  Right and meat is a step
*  The things we like this how much can you charge for it?
*  Well, I don't know but it's like cell phones cell phones used to be that Michael Douglas thing on the fucking beach
*  That's what I'm saying big old brick. It was probably a lot of money
*  I have now everybody's got a goddamn phone everybody. Yeah, but how much would they pay but a shitty phone now a
*  $200 phone now it was a goddamn world changer 13 years ago
*  You'd freak people the fuck out if you had the cheapest mass-produced Android phone you brought it to the past
*  You showed people they'd freak the fuck out. Yeah, I think that's the same with everything and as the talk technology to create
*  Viable options for people who are healthier when they eat meat, but don't want to be a part of animal agriculture
*  Like maybe this is about three months ago and it was big about how red meat does not
*  Digest no, no, they was reversing it. They was basically saying after all these years well
*  Scientists are figuring out bad for you. It's not bad for you. So that was it. That was a that was a
*  It goes both ways right but I say it's good for you then they say it's bad for you and then you got an individual
*  So, you know what? It's good for me. It's bad for her, right? But I will say that there's a way to
*  To
*  Create
*  Something that will save other lives. Yeah create it. Yeah, right. That's that's that's the evolution of man
*  There should be able to say yo, you know what?
*  We have to kill all these animals to get a coat, right now
*  We don't have to do that
*  We could form we have a formula to make a coat that's gonna keep you just as warm
*  Keep you just as serve the purpose in these and know nothing has to die for it, right?
*  But you gotta re-educate people then well you could do that. It's the same way with human
*  Human work, right if you know, you know, you know not to go back to historical right but machines come and replace
*  the the the the
*  mandatoryness of
*  Human physical labor in certain industries, right? Yeah. Okay, that's better
*  Right, so now you don't have to subjugate somebody to do that. It's more cost-effective, right? It's more cost-effective
*  It's better for it's more humane in all reality, right?
*  So we support that but the cast 22 if he's got to be conscious of as you know in your own lifetime, right?
*  if if somebody's telling me that look you could do this and
*  I'm still gonna have my let's say 70 years on the planet
*  Then you do it
*  But if I'm doing it and you want to turn my 70 years to 50 years
*  I don't want to make that bet, you know, I mean, I understand what you're saying
*  I think that's why we that's what we watch out for with anything even with the what even with the
*  You know the vegan diet or the
*  Pelotonian diet all these different things if it's gonna enhance your life. That's the biggest
*  Equity you got is your time of your life there than lean towards it
*  But if there's a chance it's gonna bully take away your life
*  Yeah, but hustle bully and you you was bullying me
*  You know what he just did no no, no, no, no, he did do
*  No, like I'm saying
*  I agree with you. But you you you talked to me like you already heard this a million times
*  Fuck these I'm sick of these
*  Like you know what me say this like he called it
*  Paleolithic but we're talking about Joey Diaz calling. What did he call you? Joy Diaz called me a
*  Rondale darlings
*  My dude is a great guy. I love this guy. We fucking hang around he got a special come on
*  He said he said get up for my homeboy. He said give it up for a Rondale darlings
*  20 years
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm let me know he got my sister pregnant, but he's here right now
*  And didn't hit that shit. I was like, I was like, thank you. You gave me a segue to my name
*  But I knew it was out of respect
*  I know what you're saying though about diets and here's the thing about diets is everybody's different
*  Everybody's body's different people were some people respond better to a vegan diet than others
*  Some people respond better to a carnivore diet than others. Everybody's got a different make
*  Like we're talking earlier about people being a allergic to peanuts where people have to make adjustments
*  There's some people that are allergic to certain green vegetables
*  You know, there's some people have weird reactions to kale and all kinds of other things
*  I hate motherfuckers allergic to healthy shit
*  One of my friends told me what time Joe he said yo, I'm allergic to pretty much all salads
*  I'm like, that's the first segue into being healthy
*  Like basically saying I'm allergic to vegetables that's crazy. Some people are though. Yeah, some girls are allergic to come
*  Did you know that
*  Jizz they're allergic to their man's come inside the vagina all over the place
*  And it would no matter where you carve your name on their belly
*  Breaking out or something they get red. It was what sucks told me that she that she don't like water
*  That's it
*  Like I don't like water like I don't like water she don't drink water
*  Yeah, I'm like that's not gonna but did she not like it because it makes her feel bad
*  Or did she not like it cuz she prefers flavor
*  You know what? That's a good point cuz some people like when like water some people like
*  Some people like I don't like water why cuz it tastes like water
*  Something like I don't like water because it don't taste like sugar or anything is in it. Let me tell you something man
*  I do hot yoga. I do it a couple days a week
*  I do 90 minute classes and water is delicious
*  I agree when you are sweating and it's 105 degrees in that room
*  You're holding these poses and sweat is dripping off your forehead and you got a 64 ounce
*  You know what it does to you filled with ice and water you want that water
*  It could be a diet coke or a fucking glass of milk. I wouldn't touch those things
*  They were right for that water when I'm when I'm tired. I'm from an era. I remember
*  it going from
*  Only tell you got water was that a water fountain water faucet water hose
*  Yeah, I know how to get bottled water when when when they started my mother thought it was a devil when they started charging motherfuckers for water
*  You listen when they started charging people water my mother was like
*  No, ain't no I could go right home and get water and I saw it go from charging like a McDonald's like they'd be like
*  Like extra for water I saw it I saw the change from that to
*  Bottling and having a tag said 99 cents for a bottle water. Yeah, but you pair for the bottle though
*  We're at the water, but whatever it is, but whatever it is stop having bottle water in the studio
*  Like it's so many people have complained and they're all right. Everyone's right. I listen to the good plan
*  Mike yeah, yeah, I got other things think about but do I?
*  What what can we figure out after we're done producing done else podcast?
*  Can we figure out a bottle water is this is just to bring the conundrum into a good full place?
*  Everybody's cup every time is gonna waste more water potentially than this
*  Guy works for dick Cheney
*  What I come to containers I'm thinking for cups and stuff like a glass bottle
*  Yeah, for every person that comes in that's that I'm just how many I mean we clean them clean them after every show
*  We have a giant jug glass bottle
*  What about if people know you're recycling does that make a difference makes me feel like a better person if they know you're recycling
*  What makes me feel like a better person if they think I'm a better person?
*  I'm like I'm drinking again some people just never gonna give a fuck about plastic. I'm one of them
*  You can do you can bury shit you can show me the animals
*  I
*  Want to go back to the hot yoga, I love it I did it today 90 minutes reason
*  Why I want to go back to that because the idea of how water tastes
*  Right, and I want to this goes back to me look this way
*  Who's this guy? Yeah. Oh that's really Stevens
*  He killed his hair
*  Okay, great, dude
*  I mean
*  Everybody loves it right rare dude that everybody loves everybody loves the only reason I said that case
*  You know, I don't know. I know you said you're gonna do comedy
*  But I didn't know if he's gonna crack a joke
*  So I just want to let you know if you crack the joke that that dude killed himself
*  Because you I don't know how hard you go
*  Know how hard you go sound like this
*  Before you just start beating it up. Uh-huh. Yep. No that has some information
*  I was going back to the idea of water. Yeah tasting good right and as well as
*  Any type of food and drink right all that tastes better after hard work
*  Yes
*  So after you doing your hot yoga and you sweaty and you put that hard work in now you understand you appreciate the water
*  Yes, so what I teach my children right is hard work when Adam when when the most hard-toe Adam
*  He said man shall work to the sweat of his brow now
*  We may have a job that don't make us sweat
*  You know, I mean, but if you ain't working out or doing something physical to make your body physically young
*  The reward of working out which is the nutrients that you have to be punished after you have burnt them out
*  You know, I mean then you're not gonna ever taste water you aren't gonna be able to bite into a piece of celery
*  And feel it
*  I know you don't think I respect celery. I know you don't think I respect
*  What you just said I know that's the only thing that you won't get that burst it is nothing like you get some celery
*  That got that motherfucking pop with no string or nothing attached to it just a clear bite
*  So I know you and I know you looked at me again, but the water this inside celery
*  I know you don't think I respect it. I respect this. Do you like celery or peanut butter?
*  I like celery with anything like I could just eat it like I could just eat celery
*  I like celery peanut butter like celery with hummus
*  You don't know how good a peach tastes
*  Right celery if you lift weights and then you eat a peach a juicy cold peach you bite into that fucking thing
*  You said you said you gotta
*  Do something in your life to appreciate it, right? Some people just drinking right like you
*  You don't know maybe I'll like you right now. Okay, I'm not saying right now. I'm not gonna do this with you
*  I'm not doing this
*  You talking about being nice early this is positive be nice. We're both drinking I'm drinking too
*  something has to
*  Like you've been drinking like the best time you appreciate water is at night after heavy drinking
*  Like you've been you your palates and things been industrial alcohol alcohol
*  You you had that feeling where you had some drinks one night the next day you drink some ice-cold water
*  God damn
*  But your body was like asking for asking for you right but when you're drunk and you're drinking that water you feel like an asshole
*  Like God what the fuck?
*  Even drinking you guys probably only a person can appreciate drinking only person gonna drink appreciate water
*  Drink it is a professional drinker cuz in their money like this I can do this with one glass of water
*  Yeah, the average motherfucker is drinking
*  They ain't given a fuck about that ratio a buddy of mine drank with John Claude Van Damme back in the day
*  Professional John Claude Van Damme was a pro
*  He said he would have a drink and he brought a gallon of water with exactly a gallon
*  So he would have a drink and then bam big fucking water
*  That's the only way he rolled just kept running the bathroom taking a piss and coming back when he drank he drank with
*  Gallon of water and whatever the fuck he was throwing down
*  I'm actually probably in the top
*  10
*  Master drinkers. Wow. Now if you ever if you ever really want to get a crazy night of drinking to see if you can hang
*  Hang don't I'll just put his glass down
*  I don't want to do this already. I don't want to do this
*  But but uh, you know, so that's that's that's the challenge anybody who ever catch me on the right day want to challenge me
*  But my brother DeVar says something that's really cool about drinking and smoking and everything right because at one point, you know
*  I'm hip-hop and I'm abusing it right? I'm just you know, just whatever yo bong bong bong bong bong
*  He's just listen
*  Y'all getting high y'all drinking for nothing
*  No celebration you did you said you drank after you complete something and then you celebrate
*  That's right, he said that I took that I took that is a real iteration and I strive
*  To give myself a reason. Yes, you know, I mean
*  Celebrate yeah, give yourself. That's a beautiful philosophy for life. Give yourself a reason
*  Yo, you too early, what are you celebrating?
*  Can we celebrate this so many people that are fan of yours
*  Spill over to the fans of mine's and I get so many tweets saying when are you gonna go on the Joe Rogan show?
*  Let's celebrate that and that's what we celebrate today
*  I mean, I've been I've been hearing about you reading about you listening to you with my friends and my peers
*  For some years now, you know, I mean this is your first time on the show
*  That's an honor cuz to me I've been listening to music forever. So I appreciate you guys tremendously
*  That your
*  Collaboration with Rage Against Machine Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothing to fuck with is the greatest
*  Collaboration and all of rap rock that look second place may be run DMC and Aerosmith
*  But to me my generation Rage Against the Machine and Wu-Tang Clan ain't nothing to fuck with is the ultimate workout
*  Can I have a whoo-tongue?
*  Can I have one fucking song man if you're doing deadlifts and that song whoo-tongue
*  Tiger style
*  Tom Morello's guitar
*  You're ready to lift I got one Wu-Tang question
*  Was Wu-Tang
*  Design sorry, I like the way you start the question
*  And you still a syllable
*  Okay, let me say
*  Was Wu-Tang
*  the vision and the design of Wu-Tang was it designed to
*  Fall apart and when I say fall apart was it designed?
*  Where a group of individuals that were getting
*  That equal due respect needed a bigger platform. So everybody see him at one time
*  But together you were bigger were you designed to elevate what I'm saying with profile of all the all the members and the reason
*  The reason I said is years ago years ago years ago years ago. I had a sketch group years ago
*  Years ago had a sketch group. It was 12 motherfuckers
*  Everybody had different personalities. Everybody was dope. Everybody could be a star in a different writing whatever
*  But nobody had to plan to get the people to see that everybody is nice, right?
*  No, I would say this right Wu-Tang was designed right to come together
*  for a common cause
*  right and that cause of course being to
*  Express our art to rise ourselves out of poverty and to feed our families
*  So that was that was a foundation, but it's not designed to fall apart
*  In fact Wu-Tang that's why on our second album is called Wu-Tang forever
*  Right meaning no matter what we do no matter if I go make movies or metham and make movies or you got right books
*  You come back together. Yeah, we always got to come back
*  Forever but hold on the finish last thing but now to put us all on the same
*  Like to expose it all to the world through one outlet
*  Yes, it had to be that it had to be that it had to be that and the reason why I said it
*  Cuz I had my sketch group. I had my sketch group years ago. It's called secret society when I was doing it
*  I remember that I had this manager and she came this was before the Dave Chappelle show
*  It was this thing. I was like, I'm gonna do these jokes on my watch. I'm watching you bro
*  Look, and um, and then I said, uh, I said, um, my one of the managers working with she was like
*  The name of our group was secret society. She said I had Mike Epps. I had Mark Thiel
*  I had red grandson bad my father and and she said
*  Donnie oh, I think secret society is falling apart. I said nigga. It was supposed to fall apart
*  It was supposed to fall apart
*  But what it's for where do we fall does it land somewhere you could grow something else?
*  Like I knew it was only three people that were gonna be stars
*  But it was for other people that were gonna be writers, right?
*  Right, it was two other enough motherfucker that was gonna be it was different shit, but we needed that. Okay, I got you there
*  So you know, so fall apart that word you said fall apart
*  I didn't mean it like you made more like spreaders wings
*  Yeah, and like even though like when I said that I mean it like even though like everybody for the most part
*  Everybody wanted to be a superstar
*  Everybody had the chops everybody wasn't a superstar right and it's proven to this day some people's like this
*  Guess what this motherfucker enrolled on eight different shows. We won right this dude is touring in Europe
*  We want exactly you know I'm saying it was like when I say fall apart
*  It was gonna go there and then it was just gonna be like it fall like this yo, yo, it was good
*  We all got it. No, let me so that they're strong enough could they that they could exist independently in different areas
*  But always come back together if they like to everyone that's why we called ourselves. We like we were turning forms like Voltron
*  Yeah, watch Voltron. Yes. Yes each of the lions
*  When you need the blazing sword
*  Everybody got to come together. Yeah, so so we took that philosophy
*  And we knew that within all of our crew that any one of us was first of all Wu Tang is a bunch of alphas
*  It was it wasn't like what it wasn't no sucker do that nobody Wu Tang got jeans that fit but you
*  Know
*  Double up on a belt 90s 90s baggy. Yes. Yes
*  Yo, we know back in those days, man, you may have one three pair of pants, right? Yeah and in the summer
*  Yeah, you know me but not but the man but the main thing is that to be able to you know
*  I made to to to have the alpha energy
*  Right and they come to a to us into an industry that was lacking that alpha energy
*  You had mystical philosophy behind it too, of course
*  But that was the thing about it is like Wu Tang was inextricably connected to kung fu
*  Right like there was like there was that's the rule. Yeah
*  Philosophy was a part of the music man
*  It was like there was a thing about you guys that you were spiritual
*  There was like a there was an intelligence and then of course you had odb who was off the rails
*  Which was beautiful about it is that you you guys all existed together
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  And even though you had this sort of spiritual kung fu kind of energy to it
*  You also had people just off the rails partying
*  Yo, they had New York
*  Fucking Wu Tang sightings and there wasn't even no whoopers in there
*  Who's that that was who like oh
*  Like I don't know if there's ever in a group that you could just mention that
*  Anybody from Wu Tang was there it was a whole bunch of not Wu Tang motherfuckers get a lot of pussy. Yeah
*  There was a guy
*  That was the truth
*  There's a guy that went on tour
*  I'm expecting Asian like oh shit
*  It's like my dick move all day
*  There's a guy who went on tour
*  He's stupid
*  There's a guy who went on tour
*  Yo check it out
*  A guy went on tour as the fake Cappadonna
*  Oh my god
*  He didn't get caught till he got about 70 grand or something like that
*  Where was that in Baltimore?
*  Atlanta
*  He just did a tour he just went out
*  Because you didn't because some of us so many of us you might not know how a motherfucker look
*  You're not gonna know when they start getting in and then you think about this
*  This is how Wu's so dope you think about this Wu got kids
*  Wu got kids now it's like we at the point now I'm old school Wu kids starting to have kids
*  So it's baby Wu's
*  Oh my god
*  But some people took advantage of it
*  Well the most beautiful thing though, you know, that's the beauty of art creativity
*  And being you know the spiritual aspect the alpha aspect all these aspects
*  Multiplied us to be a unique
*  Version of the American dream
*  and when you look at
*  You know
*  We did the documentary of Mike's and men on Showtime and you can see that
*  That it's more like it's like the lotus leaf grows out of mud, right?
*  But it's a symbol of Buddhism, which is all this peace and beauty but it grows out of mud
*  So we like that which grew out of the mud and then when you go and watch
*  Our hulu series the American saga, right?
*  You get to see
*  like this
*  Group of men weren't always on the same page wasn't always there's no way to translate each other
*  and I think the biggest thing that
*  I learned by putting the tv show on hulu
*  Is that there's other kids across america?
*  In a similar situation, yes, right? So so there's a scene where it's the soundtrack
*  It's the soundtrack to life, right?
*  But not just that talking about like there's other kids that are hearing this that they can resonate this makes sense or living it
*  Right. So, yes, so to get my first drum machine. I had the you know, get it by illegal means, right?
*  And think about how many you hire someone
*  But think about how many people think about how many people
*  Uh, you know need something to do something but don't have the means to get it and some may cross the line
*  You know at the end of the day the way I really got my equipment, right?
*  You know, I definitely try to do any way to get it, but I didn't get it by stealing it
*  Right. I had the hustle but you wanted it though
*  You wanted you didn't just want to get it for say I got you wanted because you wanted to do something with it
*  Use it right exactly. That's the difference. I sold apples oranges
*  Newspapers socks, I'm one of those socks guys. Have you been in new york back in the days socks?
*  Nipsey hustle was a socks. Yeah, you see dudes walking around selling socks. He was a sock
*  You buy you buy the way you said it. Yeah, he was I wanted to say he was a sock nigga
*  I love him. No, we're good socks. Yo, whatever because we're you're bombed down on 25th street
*  You get maybe uh, you can get a dozen for 30 bucks, right?
*  And then you can sell them at 10 hours a pack so you get a dozen packs for 30 bucks with six in a pack you go
*  Uptown right and you sell them for ten dollars just for the whole pack of socks
*  But you gotta find a neighborhood that needs socks. You just can't go in neighborhood. You got a lot of socks for anybody
*  You can't
*  Go to the most people
*  You can't do it
*  But the opposite but the opposite is this so usually he's stupid
*  Usually uptown right uptown usually people go uptown to buy their clothes high-end clothes. No, no
*  You go uptown to get
*  No, you get you get drugs from uptown
*  Oh drugs like although I could get a hundred dollars for drugs uptown bring it back downtown sell it for 200
*  Yeah, it's just saying like in a hotel uptown. They had the best rates or any drug you ever knew
*  But then you can buy drugs
*  Yeah, like you could buy a uh, uh, uh ounce uptown
*  Right and sell it downtown or even take it back to satin island. You're gonna triple your money easy easy
*  So satin island's three you can easily triple your money like the village is two
*  Yeah like that and you go out of state you may five times it and that's where all the new york
*  Motherfuckers coming down to dc in virginia exactly
*  but socks
*  You buy downtown
*  And take it uptown because the drug dealers are fly they gotta have clean socks
*  And so they so now they're buying the socks for ten dollars that you paid five dollars for
*  That was do you remember when they had movies remember they had vhs tapes so people would sit in the back of the movie theater
*  I don't film the movie and make a vhs. They'd set up a quarter. That was the worst the worst bootlegging shit ever
*  But you feel like terrible but if you but but then that's the same time
*  That's when um
*  Vcr just came in so it didn't matter the quality. You just had to have something to put in the fucking new technology
*  Yeah, you know what you know what you know what? Uh, uh
*  Artform or whatever um supports new technology always deal with porno whenever with your son
*  It's true. Well, no no no no what i'm saying is go go go whenever there's a new whether it's from beta to vhs
*  To cd
*  It's porno
*  That gets people to explore the new technology. They paved the way they paved the way I don't know that
*  Yeah, because there's so many people that are jerking off. There's just it's an
*  unsatisfiable quantity
*  You can't you you always can count on them people are always going to jerk off the porn
*  So how do you get it to them quicker? How do you get it to them?
*  Where you can make some money from rewinding to like cd to a leak to now?
*  All you need is tag words the only thing that's been explained to me though
*  The way we think about people stealing music or people stealing comedy like they think about stealing porn
*  So if you go to certain sites where it's just free and you just watch porn
*  Apparently the people that make it they don't get a piece of that
*  So someone's making a ton of money and the other people are stealing so you say we don't know you can't negotiate too much
*  If it puts these wide open, this is like
*  I'm just saying so it's like I know like this is how I want to do it
*  Yo, you can't be the goat like you need to get somebody in between you making your argument
*  I see what you're saying, but I mean, isn't it?
*  It's something it's a commodity. It's a thing just like a joke. Yeah. Yeah in a way
*  I mean if you create something like if it's legal if you legal if it's legal rather and you hire cameraman
*  You pay an actor you pay an actress you let them fuck you give them a certain amount you film it
*  And then that's yours
*  And then someone takes that and then they put it up on their website
*  And then you could watch it for free and they sell advertising space and they make money off something that they didn't buy
*  They didn't buy it at all. That's infringing. Yeah, it's it's no different than if they downloaded a wu tang album
*  And then they started selling it. They put it they put it on a website and then put ads connected to that wu tang album
*  So then that means they need to get better lawyers. Can you go say a better story?
*  Guys with that one album that that that drug pharmacy dude martin. What's his name?
*  Scrooge he he actually got a hold
*  Of one of your outlets an unreleased wu tang. I heard it was two of them the street city was two. What's the reality?
*  Well, we have the man
*  Yeah, the reality of it is that
*  Uh, it's now sitting in a temperature control room in the department of justice really
*  Yeah, so it's his he owns it still well
*  He's you know, he's uh, he's incarcerated right? Right, right, right
*  And so so I think a lot of his assets has been seized by the government
*  And including that album so those songs have never been released
*  Look at that fucking thing. Yeah, but is that beautiful or what that guy's got to be broke
*  Is there a way I could buy that off of him?
*  For real how how would that look right here? How dope would that look? It'd be beautiful right here, but I would release that online
*  Or or release it with you or let you really I'll buy it. You mean for free though
*  I don't give a fuck whatever you want
*  But that the sitting there makes no sense to me and that box looks dope and I know that guy's in jail
*  You figure out a way to get out martin holla at your boy
*  And you know what? That's how you work there
*  I tell you what dope right here though. It would I tell you one thing
*  I did have a conversation with the gentleman, right with martin
*  Yeah, I said listen yo because he had a you know, he had a lot of bad things going on for him. I said yo
*  If I was you I would take this chance to do philanthropy
*  And I would give this away to the public if I was him
*  Yeah based on how much he had talking from the public. Yeah, but he was he was the net like we talked about earlier
*  He wasn't a nice person he didn't want to give the impression. It was a nice person
*  He wanted to be I don't give a fuck and what you're saying was too. He was having too much fun, son
*  It was just too much like whatever bitch fuck you. I got this
*  But you know what? I don't think he understood consequences. I think he was doing that. No, of course he didn't he was he thought look
*  He's a kid. Wasn't he born into money? No
*  Where'd he make his money? No, he made his money in the pharmaceutical industry
*  He was he was immigrant parents who was like janitors, but he wasn't like born to this company
*  No, so he was a part of the company. He was part of the company
*  But I think more thing than he had he had tenacity more than anything. Oh, okay
*  But he probably never experienced a public guy like he did with this whole pharmaceutical crisis where he's overcharging for was AIDS medication
*  So what he probably did but I think that his point he wanted he wanted to be known as that guy
*  He was a smart dude
*  He wanted to be known as that guy. He didn't mind he didn't mind being a super villain. Just put it down
*  Yeah, and then it was like he wanted more relaxed luther, but he didn't want to be on a low-making money
*  He tried to be on the podcast. He did he reached out to me. Yeah, that would have been interesting
*  But I did tell him I'm interested just to you know, whatever is interesting, but I did tell him
*  I mean me i'm a type of person. I'm always going to try to say
*  Some advice in a positive form right that's just my personality. I'm like listen bro
*  They're talking shit about you in the world. It don't look good for you. Wu-Tang is good. I told him Wu-Tang forever
*  Yeah, I said if I was you
*  I'll take this opportunity to do something good. How about this? How about this?
*  Maybe he sells me the box and then we release the the music
*  I'll buy the whole thing from him and then we'll release it. I don't know Jesus. I don't
*  Okay
*  If he's got it he wants to sell it the weird thing for me he wants to sell it
*  He's locked up for how long though, he just lost his appeal so oh
*  The thing can you sell shit while you're in jail?
*  You play monopoly
*  When I play monopoly, don't you do that? Yo, I just think like this. I think like this do you do that?
*  When you play monopoly and you're in jail at your turn you still be like I want a house
*  No, it drives me crazy
*  How many songs?
*  um
*  Like 25 songs. That is ridiculous. I think me personally that needs to be released. I think I don't my personal opinion
*  Nobody
*  in the history of music
*  Has been able to make
*  An idea or so that's never heard
*  art
*  art like
*  To be quite honest, it might not even be no motherfucking songs in there
*  Yo, do you think he listens?
*  He knows
*  No, I'm not saying that but I'm saying it's the point i'm making the point i'm making is it's more
*  Valuable it's legend never been heard
*  Never been cracked, right?
*  Didn't release you release it then you set it up for people to be critical of it
*  Can't kind of give the opinion the opinion is there was something so dope that we could just break it down to one
*  In the fucking like what was the thought process behind that? Well for my point of view, right? It was just like that's how I you know
*  Hold on you got it right for my point of view
*  Music was being devalued
*  Right by streaming services by society, right?
*  How so don't do streaming of course right illegal download illegal downloads
*  Right, if you want to let's talk a little bit of business. I won't go too deep
*  I'll give me two minutes of business. All right, so let's just take napster, right?
*  Who's the founder of this type of technology, right?
*  And he takes millions of songs and gives them away and then now people are getting all these songs for free
*  Now the music industry
*  Like any other industry has a certain quota of business it does every year
*  Like every other industry right whether it's four billion hours a year or five billion hours a year
*  It's an industry of a group of people and that's their yearly quota
*  So if napster comes right and and and he takes all these songs where all these people who are waiting for their publishing checks
*  Waiting for their economics to be created from music
*  Now there's no publishing check all the numbers are now decreased because there's no physical sell of your music for us to accumulate
*  A value to send you a check but then at the end of the day after he does that
*  He gets a billion dollars
*  So now you're talking what belongs to let's say say there's a thousand artists that's worth
*  Value in far as you know that sell records that you could say accumulate money, right?
*  So we took a we took the power of a thousand and put it in one man's hand
*  Okay, so that's one of the first mistakes as an industry we make and then the second mistake we make
*  Is that now there's services going and there's illegal downloads and people won't pay
*  a dollar
*  For the record, right? Right?
*  And for an album you won't pay 10 to 12 hours for an album even this day with 20 dollars
*  You won't pay that but
*  You'll pay 300 400 for your headphones
*  Two three hundred hours for your ipod or your phone
*  And you're using it for music. Let me ask you this. What's the best way without your headphones?
*  Without music your headphones is useless, right?
*  So why would you not pay the 10 20 hours for the music because they don't have to right?
*  Because they can get it some other way, but let me ask you this. What is the best way to support artists?
*  What's the best way to buy it? Well the best way to buy it now music. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Oh, no, no now now your music well now mutang clan anybody's music
*  What's the best way that you get the most out of it?
*  Well, the best way in the past was physical but now the industry has figured out how to monetize the digital streamers
*  So now things are starting to rebalance but during this period of time, you know
*  Maybe within the last three four years it's starting to rebalance but you look at from 2000 to 2015
*  It's a total unbalanced and a lot of artists
*  Have to stop making music because there's no economics right now a group like the wu tang clan, right? So let's just say
*  Let's just say the average verse for a woo rapper, you know, let's say yo remember let me get let me get 16
*  He might be yo, yes, tell him he don't know what 16 is. Tell him. Yeah 16
*  Let's say mess say yo, don't be 20 cent for that, right?
*  Okay, 20 000 joe. Okay. So now let's just say
*  He got 10 verses on this album
*  You know, I may let's say every other room member do the same
*  So to get to get an album made it may cost a million dollars
*  A studio session a studio session is up to let's say at the cheapest level 100 bucks an hour
*  You do it to do a 12-hour blockout. That's another grand a day just to get into the studio
*  Then you got your engineer then you got so it costs money to create music
*  Right, but now you get all this done and you want to sell it and somebody just the world just takes it for free
*  So now you can't recreate again now
*  Even though the tools have gotten easier now and you could do a lot with your laptop and all that even a laptop is 2g
*  even the the download
*  just
*  Logic right which everybody use 200 dollars, man
*  And so you need a social so so it's merchandise and brand now
*  It's merchandise and brand it's merchandise and being able to take the idea of that brand
*  But if you're a fan, but if you're a fan, what's the best way to support?
*  You what's the best way to support wu-tang clan, what's the best way to support is it apple music like what is what is the best way itunes?
*  No, no now everything is found this way. Otherwise if you can stream it streaming's good. You can stream it spotify is good
*  Spotify is good. You can download it directly to your phone if you are
*  If you're gonna give directions to fans, like what's the best way to support wu-tang clan?
*  What's the best way to accumulate music or choir music? I mean if I just put it in they're all good now like streaming
*  Yeah, I think it's balanced. Let me see this tunes. I was just amazon. Look music is the second thing the catch 22 here joe is this
*  Okay
*  Now music is also made to be heard
*  Yes, so
*  While one point I try to prove a point by saying look i'm gonna put a value on it
*  So, you know, there's a value to it because there's a value to me but then on the other point
*  Right. We put I put another album out called a better tomorrow which is like yo do what you want with that
*  You know how come because I don't make music for me to listen to
*  I make it for the world to listen to it at the same time
*  So the best way to support your artist is just by listening to the music
*  All right
*  Beautiful how much it's beautiful. But so this is good though
*  This is because i've always wanted to know this because i've always i've always been like what do I do?
*  Do I do itunes? Do I do amazon? Like where do you get the most money back from?
*  Yeah, I think look I think they the system has found a way to balance itself. So okay, so it's okay now
*  Yeah, so spotify is good
*  Streaming, you know streaming look, you know, I mean I think even Taylor swift is thinking about coming over to the streaming thing
*  That dirty girl everybody's gonna come to the streaming. Yeah, because because because that's the way to listen now
*  As long as she gets a good deal, right? The only thing like you said just the whole thing at the end of the day
*  Is play fair? Yes, like you know what you can say
*  I don't want this streaming service, but somebody has to have a platform for people to even come check for you
*  Yes, 100 but the other thing is the whole thing is like fans need to know fans need to know like
*  What like if i'm a fan and uh, you know 14 dollars is not too much money for me to spend
*  I need to know where to spend it
*  I would if I could if there's one place you could tell me that's the best way to support wu-tang clan
*  This is the best way to support if I was a fan, right?
*  If I was a fan and I had the money to spend, you know, I would definitely you know
*  I would buy the vinyl right? Why because it's tangible, right?
*  Right. I don't know. It's so funny because that makes me why because it's tangible. I'm spending money, right? Okay
*  You get a physical object. Yeah physical for physical especially a record like you buy the vinyl
*  There's a commitment. That's so funny that you said it because I know people of certain
*  Blah blah blah blah
*  That blah blah blah. It's like this. Oh shit. They want audio rights to something
*  So they can put it on vinyl and then the value is the history the story like a motherfucker
*  One of vinyl wu-tang because it's art just like with the the one joint
*  It's all right brother. And and like you said we talked about it earlier
*  It's coming back. Yeah, it's coming back
*  I'm not saying it's gonna go to clubs or anything like that in a dj's like that
*  But the act of collecting something and take it take home with you. It's untagible. Remember CDs CDs is like
*  This technology is about to die. Why would I buy this CD?
*  Because
*  It has a booklet remember? Yeah
*  Albums that was a big part what albums were was the artwork. Yeah. Yeah, it was the artwork and see you can pick it
*  You can put your weed on it. Yeah
*  And those cities you bring your weed up
*  Big bamboo they gave you a giant piece of rolling paper
*  And that was the last thing and I don't see what you did, but I don't see people doing that
*  But I think it's gonna go back
*  Nobody's everybody's not gonna have 1200s in your house or whatever
*  But some people especially if it's a genre or something that you connect with they're gonna be like I want to buy that
*  Well, you know what's important though for fans. We don't know
*  Go go pee bro. I've been here for a long time. Go pee. Go pee. It's okay
*  Wait for you. It's okay. It's okay. No, you're gonna talk shit when I leave
*  You were like this. He probably wouldn't go eat some bacon
*  Fuck this
*  For a lot of fans. They don't know like they don't know what there's no clearly established
*  What's the best way to support an artist like we don't know and it's more gray now than ever
*  But like I said if you look the physical act of going somewhere, right? Right and buying something
*  You know, it's a give and take it's an act. It's like going to a restaurant you go there
*  Look, the food is three times the price of cooking at home, right? But it's a physical act
*  so if if you really love an artist, right it's just like uh,
*  I just got the um, I paid 100 hours for the soundtrack to the uh,
*  Once upon a time in hollywood soundtrack
*  Um a hundred dollars. Yeah, it was a hundred dollars for the sound. It was a collector's it was a they had like a collector's vinyl
*  Okay down at the grammy museum. I saw it. I was like i'm gonna take this
*  It's a some some, you know some great songs on there. Uh, what's the band that made Cherokee nation?
*  What's the name of that band? Uh, I won't have to go there now. But anyway point being made Cherokee people
*  Yeah, Cherokee. Yeah people
*  Cherokee pride yeah, who made that one? I don't know
*  Yeah, who the fuck made that?
*  Cherokee people
*  What is it Cherokee pride
*  Who made that
*  What is it
*  Finally a bunch of paul revere and the raiders. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Paul revere in the latest
*  Yeah, that's a bold move george washington the dudes in the boat
*  I know right but point being made is I wanted that
*  Vinyl, yes the physical thing I wanted that and I paid my hundred dollars for it, right and I walked out the store with it
*  You know, I mean, yeah, it's just like comic books, you know, I just got a first issue of the new x-men
*  I actually bought it from mef. So when I see him i'm gonna give it to him
*  But because he loves comic books and I was in uh, I was in um
*  Where was that? St. Not st. Louis after st. Louis. I was in uh,
*  Anyway, I was in that area and I had a comic book store there I went in there
*  And I was like yo, they had the first issue of the new x-men
*  Bought that in plastic put that in my bag
*  And of course you could go online and you could do it but the physical tangible thing I think is the best way to support
*  Artists and if you are and if you and nowadays the way artists actually make the most economics
*  Um is through live concerts. So
*  And only way that's going to work is if somebody hear your music, right? So I always tell fans look just listen
*  You know, I mean listen enjoy
*  You know we creating something for you to understand or for you to feel a vibe or for me to take you
*  To my location like cash rule everything around me
*  We're taking you back to new york the new york crime side, you know
*  Um, and then and then when you come down and you get that song in your dna and you come to a concert and you see
*  us perform it now we have a
*  Symbiotic relationship, you know, I mean, so that's how I see that's beautiful because you're giving them a physical object
*  Yeah, I think it's important. I think you're right man. That's why I want that goddamn box. Where are you martin get out of jail
*  Sell me that box bitch. Come on
*  How much do you think he'll sell it for if you had a guess how much do you buy it for
*  Um, he had it. I mean
*  I think they bought it for two million two million, but I think I think he had it on
*  I think he had it on ebay. I'm gonna I'm gonna release it for free
*  I'm gonna release it if that's okay with you if it's not tell me and you guys can sell it
*  But we need to have that that needs to be released
*  20 what 24 25 25 songs get the fuck out of here. Let's make this happen, man martin where you at
*  It'd be nice if you whatever he says calls you like
*  collect call
*  A jail call
*  I hear the feds listening martin martin martin when you're getting out. I need the box
*  For the desk martin. Wow, did you um, so so wow, so so now that donel is gone. I could talk about it
*  He's the best man, we finally got him to do a podcast
*  I I shamed him into doing one episode that he already did right because he didn't want to come here and tell me that
*  He hadn't done it yet. So he did one and then we're gonna take that one. Jamie's gonna produce it and edit it
*  He's over there saying is that like
*  We're gonna do it together. But we'll promote it. I'll promote it on instagram. I've just been trying to get him to do it forever
*  You know, he's a goddamn natural. He's natural. He's a natural. He's he makes me cry. You can't be stopped
*  Now now you said you do hot yoga. Are you into zen?
*  Any anything zen like what's
*  What's what's it? What's your is it all physical with yoga for you or is it something spiritual?
*  No, it's what it's it's a mind cleansing thing as much as it's a physical cleansing thing because it's all about
*  Concentrating on my breath and ignoring all the fucking ideas that keep darting in and out of my head
*  It's just like meditation in the sense that i'm trying to calm myself down and center myself and i'm trying to cleanse myself
*  So when i'm holding poses and i'm concentrating on my breathing what it does is it eliminates all
*  Of the stuff that I don't necessarily want in my head, right?
*  It allows me to manage my mind better
*  And I think that's the thing that is misunderstood about yoga because in my opinion and i've done both i've done regular meditation
*  I've done physical exercise. I think there's a benefit a great
*  Unrecognized benefit to physical meditation and I find that in yoga. I find that in martial arts
*  Yeah, I don't know if you find that as well. So definitely yeah because you you have you have still meditation
*  I'm sorry. I tried to sneak man. I'm so sorry. Those fucking stupid lights man
*  We gotta fix it. Jamie and I have been talking about it for three years. What happened to the chest son?
*  The what? The chest. Oh it got re it's being refilled with terrifying
*  Concoctions so we're talking about physical any day meditation
*  Right and still meditation. So let's just say like there's a meditation where you just sit still
*  Yeah, and you just breathe and actually Wu-Tang, right? So i'm gonna give you a little Wu-Tang law
*  so Wu-Tang
*  Uh, the story is there's a monk named Chang-Seng Fei who leaves Shaolin temple because he
*  feels that the physical
*  Exercise
*  Is not the pure way to enlightenment
*  Right. He thought that the kung fu was too external right too many complications for ego
*  And so he returned so he retreats to the to the mountain
*  And he goes for internal kung fu but in the process of doing internal kung fu such as Tai Chi
*  uh, Zen Yi
*  Uh, Bakwa
*  Right. Mm-hmm. Like these techniques like there's this thing called the ace piece brocade where you just sit
*  You know what I mean? And you just do very small movements you first you bang on the back of your ears
*  It's called banging on the heavenly drums to open up the back of your brain
*  Like if you do that right now, that makes sense if you cover your ears, right if you take the headphones off, right?
*  And you cover your ears like this you take your thumb like that and you okay
*  Of course it's louder right you hear it right? Oh, it gives you like a little rhythm, right?
*  So you do that first, right?
*  And that's just to open up your your brain like to open that up, right?
*  You do it while inhaling exhaling balancing again and yang
*  Right, that's one of the brocades
*  And so he made these eight pieces of brocade right brocade brocade means like something is blocked, right?
*  Right, right blockade, right? So you want to open it up, right? Open up these open up your your your main vessels
*  You know what I mean? Okay, of course being your ears your eyes your nose your mouth
*  You know that goes back to uh, jesus saying the seven churches
*  What is the seven churches that jesus spoke to the seven churches?
*  Well, he spoke to the two eyes the two nose two holes in your nose your mouth your two ears
*  So he's speaking to a man said out of his mouth came a double-edged sword
*  The sword of course no sword can't come out of your mouth. Your tongue is that sword double-edged exactly
*  Yeah, so shout out to all the preachers to eat pussy, but go ahead
*  Wait, that's p that's p e p you gotta you gotta you gotta make that an act for them
*  BEP
*  Right well you know a BEP
*  Well anyway before the connellingus part of it comes in right before we get to the connellingus
*  So so wu tang itself, right?
*  This guy leaves the temple goes to the mountain to meditate and he's dealing with still meditation
*  Right, but in all reality when you mix it together wu tang and shaolin you have the physical
*  And the still meditation and it takes both to actually find this
*  Level of enlightenment you're looking for
*  So when bodhidharma came to shaolin he actually came from india so bodhidharma was an indian monk
*  Who was more of a yoga student?
*  He comes to shaolin and he's trying to teach them the indian way
*  But he realized that all the monks are too weak to sit there in their still meditation
*  And so he created something called the low hands right or the 18 low hands or
*  Right and and he these forms and these steps were made so that now they could do a physical movement
*  To build their body up so now they can meditate longer because you could have a strong mind
*  What's the use of a strong mind without a strong body?
*  And what's the use of a strong body without a strong mind?
*  So that's the yin and yang must be balanced and so that's the shaolin and wu tang philosophy
*  So when we made wu tang clan
*  And i'll go back to myself with this we made wu tang clan as the name of our crew
*  We took the verse from the bible about the double s sword and jesus speaking right we said okay
*  We're going to use our words and our wisdom and our spirituality to talk to the world through our music, right?
*  But we also took that in the wu tang law. They said the wu tang martial art monks. They developed the best sword style
*  Right, so we like well, we're the wu tang. We have the best sword style, but we come from shaolin
*  because that's the
*  The well with springs forth right and so we took the physical of shaolin as our base
*  The spiritual the meditative force of wu tang and we put it together and our album starts off
*  If what you say is true the shaolin and the wu tang could be dangerous
*  Oh my god, that's
*  That's hip hop history. Ladies and gentlemen, I need a wu. I need a wu name son
*  Yo, give me a wu tang name. Will it be?
*  I don't know. I gotta you gotta you gotta go through that name generator, sir. Joe
*  Joe Jamie, can you name generate me? No, how do you do it? You can't change who you are
*  The words won't change your essence. I just want to your essence is donnell rawlings. There's just no escaping that joe
*  I respect what you're saying right now
*  I respect that and you said very white right now
*  I understand that I understand that I appreciate that yo when I did that show hollyweed with um, kevin smith
*  There was this one this wu tang generator arrogant dreamer
*  Come on man, arrogant dreamer is pretty dope. I like that. I take that listen when I was doing that
*  Um kevin smith show hollyweed. Yeah, there was a part where i'm in i'm in i'm i'm i own a dispensary
*  I'm in there right and I smoke weed and the only time I think I can spit is when I smoke weed
*  So i'm smoking weed and I just was doing these bars and at the end of everyone I said wu tang
*  At the end of everyone I say wu tang and kevin smith know me every time I text him
*  He's like wu tang forever. Well dave says that shit all the time. This is what this is what I pitched to him
*  For the hollyweed show like they know every time I write it's like yo nigga wu tang forever what wu tang forever
*  So we had I pitched a scene where all i'm saying is wu tang wu tang and i'm in a dispensary, right?
*  And then you know how they had a security security cams
*  And shit, I'd be like it'd be like am who is it and motherfuckers say it's wu tang
*  Yo actual wu tang show up to the weed spot and that's the thing I punctuate all my raps with ah shit
*  You know, you know what dave dave dave did have a lot of jokes with wu tang in it, right?
*  And I really appreciate I love him. He's a beautiful man had us on the show
*  But he did one wu tang joke, right?
*  That that fucked me up
*  What was it? Can I talk about it real quick? Yes, please. So i'm watching it. It's uh, maybe so he did the three netflix specials
*  Right. It was the first one
*  And so me and my wife we excited yo dave boom we put it on and we watching it and we dying laughing
*  and then he uh
*  He goes into the the scene where he does like he's at a party
*  And he had the transgender dude fall out and all that and everything and then he then he goes, you know
*  He don't understand
*  You know how you know how somebody do that like, you know, I mean like what what what does somebody do?
*  They just you know, they just chop the dick off wu tang bang and they just keep going
*  I was like what what the fuck was that?
*  All right
*  We both kind of didn't say nothing like for the first three minutes
*  Like, you know, I just woke this cut watch and right right, and then it was like what the fuck
*  Every part say baby what you get that one. So no, I didn't get it. No, right so we didn't get it, right?
*  Next fucking day
*  Next fucking day. I'm somewhere to meet in an elevator and boom it hits me
*  Because it stayed on my fucking mind, right? I fucking start dying laughing. What it was a punctuate
*  No
*  No, what so what was the difference with what you thought the joke did you didn't get but what made you get it?
*  Well, maybe get it was just
*  The i'm trying to because david's david's a genius yo, right?
*  His shit is crazy. All right, it's like a lyric you're gonna get the rhyme when you get the rhyme, right?
*  Right. So what he was saying he said he don't understand how a man chop his dick off
*  So what a man do a man just goes
*  The reason this is
*  Because tell me what you got. I'll tell you what I got what I got was
*  the most gangster phrase you could say
*  That describes the hardest shit you could do
*  Like it's wu-tang. You know what I'm saying? Right now cut your dick off. No taking that like like
*  That's thief now
*  Because one of your wu-tang man did that shit exactly hold on
*  So now that's what it was who did it who did it? No, so there's
*  So there's a dude there's a dude that was affiliated with us, right? Don't say affiliate motherfucker. He was a wu-tang
*  He was a wu-tang. Hold on. Listen, man. He wasn't part of the wu-tang clan. All right
*  All right. Hold on. Now. I gotta give you a test before we go further. I don't want to test. I agree with you
*  From the slumber chow land wu-tang clan strikes again the rizza the jizzer
*  The
*  Inspector deck ray kwan the chef you guard ghost face killer and
*  Method man, of course a master killer and capitano may kwan are in new york right now for the jets giants game. Yeah. Yeah, so
*  Of course capitano and master killer and a lot of mathematics and sometimes even red man in street life, but
*  But check it out
*  But this so so we had other groups we signed north star I actually signed north star I signed the black knights
*  Uh both west coast groups actually some uh, some uh some from long beach some from compton
*  You know and uh, you know made a lot of songs with them town and young brothers. So one of the members of the north star
*  Zoned out
*  He's zoned out on some crazy one of them drugs you talk about zoned out
*  And what they call it when you do it? I don't what they call it
*  Yeah
*  Oh, there's a word for it though
*  What's the what's the word when you do it castrate yourself? Yeah, I had to get the word brother. Okay, so now
*  So he castrates himself, right? So now
*  That's the punch line of his joke
*  The punch line is like because this dude for no reason it was a car back. Yeah
*  So you got it in an elevator yeah, i'm just walking on this elevator. Oh shit
*  It's a
*  Joke with the issue like 24 hours later. Oh my god that bit has a long fuse
*  Yeah, so yeah, but dave dave does got those kind of jokes
*  Oh, man, I remember when we were on the road when that actually was the news right and he was like
*  Wu-tang punctuated so much in anything whatever you do for fun anywhere for anything Wu-tang forever
*  So when a member
*  Or at least an affiliated member of the Wu-tang cuts off his dick
*  And then he doesn't think he could have been a he could have been a like a nephew a woof you
*  Did he glue up in a woo nephew or whatever? You know what's so crazy about that incident first of all that incident was very hurtful
*  You know, like, you know, yeah
*  But it was hurtful in a sense like when it happened I was in I was doing a tv show called gang related, right?
*  And so, you know like I would go like say it happened on the night it happened the next night is a cast
*  Well, the whole cast get together and this shit is the news
*  This is like on every network every tmz. This is like oh shit and i'll come in the room and everybody's like
*  What the fuck happened like you know, I mean, yeah
*  But i'm gonna tell you the thing about is like I don't know what you need to do to represent your gangster
*  But cutting your dick off is the most go hard shit a motherfucker could do right now
*  That's like next level next level now homie so so I had a buddy with me at the time paul banks from interpol
*  And we was working on the album and so he saw me. He's like damn bobby
*  You look kind of fucking depressed. I said yo, man
*  Like I don't like the way this shit sound man. It's like, you know, I mean it's like the press it feels
*  You don't feel right. That's first of all
*  I don't think I found in the history of me of my study. I never heard of a man chopping his own shit off
*  This shit is biblical
*  Yeah, so so i'm already even though some people may have done it
*  You don't know about it. This shit is this shit is biblical
*  Doing it to yourself, right? So maha barata and we said to what he said. He's like listen
*  He probably was really fucked up probably
*  He said he was probably
*  He was fucked up he said he's probably he's probably really fucked up. I said yeah, I said but then
*  You know what i'm saying? Then they say he jumped out the window out of a two-story. Uh, he jumped over the balcony of a two-story
*  uh
*  Apartment building but didn't die. They got up and they said he jumped after he cut his dick off
*  Yeah after no not no, so no this is back to him
*  Cut your dick off jumping over and didn't hit full stride when he hit down. No, no, so so so my man paul said this he said
*  I think he was sober when he jumped
*  Um, how can you get that check it out? He said I think he was sober
*  When he jumped and he went on to give me this whole story by one of his friends
*  That would had a problem. He had it because he had to console me right right now. I'm kind of puzzled
*  So he's like he's trying to fuck up. He's trying to console me and he told me
*  I said yeah, but he didn't die. He said yeah, he didn't die
*  Because he wasn't gonna die
*  Like you know, I mean so gave me a little metaphor in my head
*  So he said
*  I had a friend who used to drink and shit and one night he had a problem with he in one night
*  He was in a hotel and he and he laid on the fucking the the balcony of a window, right?
*  And then it said and everybody said yo get the fuck off that and the windows open said if he fall this way
*  He's going down 10 stories, but if you go this way, he just hit the floor
*  He's in the room and that's the that's the whole thing. Right? He said that
*  He went this way
*  He went down every 10 stories 10 stories, but during the fall
*  He sobered up, but when he hit the ground he didn't die
*  He became quadriplegic
*  The dick cut off motherfucker. No, no, no
*  This is this is this the alcohol dude that fell down point being made is that you ain't going to go until it's time to go
*  Right or 100 so you think you're killing yourself. It ain't happen
*  But if you cut your dick off and you survive that that's the time to go. Hold on. Hold on
*  But so so the idea is was he sober when he jumped and so and I had the chance to speak to him
*  Right. Uh, I sent him a quran, you know, I mean I was like, I think you know
*  you know you might have to get into some studies brother because
*  And you know, it's so so so so anyway sending the quran. Can't nobody hold you down off of that
*  And then I said, uh, I said let me ask you a question
*  And the question was, you know, did you you know when you jumped?
*  You know what you said? Yeah
*  He's like
*  For that moment like it was everything else was whatever it was and you know, you can read his story and he says why he says
*  What happened in the story?
*  But when he jumped he that was the moment of sobriety
*  And and for me that was like now that's the
*  When he jumped when he cut his dick off that wasn't the moment of sobriety. It's it's after
*  Okay, you know when you ever do some shit you ever been fucked up? Yeah, and you do some shit and oh
*  Like like I I had a really bad
*  Uh sexual thing mad mad it was one of those sex nights
*  You know, I was I was I was covered up
*  I kind of I kind of had like a blanket over me and was going to room the room fucking girls
*  It was like it was one of them like bad
*  Sex drug in your system. I'm fucking everybody tonight
*  And you just going
*  Hard against the grain against the grain, but then there's that moment
*  Like oh shit, I fucked up right. I knew I fucked up right and you and you get sober for about
*  30 seconds
*  And then the hot kid back in you go knock
*  Where those loads went
*  Anyway, uh, yeah, anyway, that's my that's that's it. But so he jumped bang, but didn't he glue his dick back on?
*  He stitched it back on right? Did he? He fixed it. It's all good
*  Bro, is that true? Yeah, I I stopped following the story after that
*  Yeah, that was after but jake. I hope he's okay that joke. I was like that that was just thank god for surgeons
*  Thank god for scientists. Thank thank god for
*  That's like forever will be the most gangsta shit you can do
*  Shove your dick off and say wu-tang
*  That dude they should pose don't say that because he's gonna film it now
*  They're gonna world star at hoping that dave season so i'm getting i'm getting the track today i'm getting the track today
*  Uh getting the track and you may get it to me right now son
*  You about to disappear man. Oh you are no no give me
*  You guilt you
*  Say nothing
*  I went there and you said the thing about donald guilted me into producing his show
*  He guilted jamey into being the technical advisor
*  He guilted you in the music and then he tried to pretend like you were trying to run out of here
*  When you clearly know that's not what I said what I said was like i'm sick of you talking shit to me
*  Here it is
*  Could you just produce the first episode 100% and get off the track and jamey wasn't fucked with me at all
*  He didn't know what to do. No, he knew what to do. He knew to get the me the fuck out of here
*  So he would make eye contact
*  I knew I had another show to do right now. I didn't know he needed me to do it
*  And I didn't know he does five shows a week. Listen

*  James gonna beep over. Okay, so
*  description of his email
*  People are mad right now. What the fuck it was better when it was live. I could send out a picture of my dick
*  so the hulu show was um
*  Created by me my partner alexi
*  Uh exactly the producer brian grazer
*  I love brian. Yeah, he was just here last week. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's great. That's right. He's an interesting guy, man
*  Yeah, very very I really like talking to him. Yeah, and he uh, well he's he's he's a
*  Entertainment icon and genius and what he do and he had uh, he actually read my book the dow of wool
*  and
*  um
*  That led to him having an interest in making this into a tv series, you know what I mean?
*  um, and so we uh
*  we partnered with alexi francy caffo and we
*  Voted episodes of this with you know, got to write his room
*  Uh pitted on hulu. It's called wu tang in the american saga an american saga
*  and uh
*  It follows you know us
*  you know pre
*  Wu tang days in all reality, right?
*  so you get to see some of the things that happened in our neighborhoods and
*  and some of the things that molded us to the men that we became and it's not only because of like uh
*  Like you know, we you know, we have the liberty to fictionalize some things right? So for instance, there could be a character
*  You know you think about
*  eric garner
*  Right, that's like popular within the last three to five years, right? Maybe a little longer, right? But for us
*  that
*  Same thing happened when we was kids in our neighborhood and the same neighborhood mind you of course, okay
*  So that's that happened on stan nyan, you know what I mean? And and and and we was able to
*  do the show
*  Kind of go back and look at some of the same problems
*  That we have as american citizens
*  In our communities that we're still facing today for instance in episode three
*  one of my favorite episodes
*  You see a black mother
*  addressing a funeral
*  about how
*  so many
*  Of these kids are dying from gun violence over things
*  That's not even valuable things that could be replaced whether sneakers or gold chain, but the life can't be replaced
*  And she goes on to say something that uh
*  You know as a mother
*  The pain of labor you hear how painful that is, right? I've seen how painful it is
*  So imagine the pain a woman feels when their child is killed in cold blood
*  I can't even imagine that and she goes on to say we never see our children as
*  Thieves gangsters
*  You know
*  Criminals we see them as our babies
*  You know what I mean? And we're turning our community into a war zone
*  And we gotta realize that this is our community and these are our
*  Babies so the so the show gets a chance to tap into all that because these things happen
*  And I was talking about earlier. We're talking about the same thing. Yeah, we're talking about we're talking about guns
*  I was like a black person perspective and their views and how they look at gun is totally different from someone
*  That grew around where the nra was strong what grew around where they had gun laws
*  You know i'm saying what average black person when you think about a gun you think about something that could take somebody's life
*  Yeah, you know i'm saying and you and not only that you also think about
*  A gun in certain cases what took a life of somebody that was innocent. It was somebody with an authority
*  You know i'm saying so like most black people their connection with guns is totally different from just like
*  Hunting and I want to protect my household. Yeah, because
*  And and in our show, we know we tap into that
*  But at the same time we also tap into that feeling when when the kid gets a a new drum machine, right?
*  Without the instruction manual
*  And he's gonna stay up all night trying to figure it out
*  You know I mean and play on it and and make something and eventually make something
*  You know like for the case of me
*  That sp 1200 I made that beat for brain the pain
*  Which is one of method man's first videos and one of his first chart and songs
*  And you did think to think about
*  Me trying to figure this thing out and figure it out and then make and getting excited every time you figure it out
*  And then and then make something that the world appreciates, right?
*  So you get that that angle as well
*  But then you also you know you get you know at the time my mother was uh working for a man named fat larry
*  And fat larry was a ass you learn cousin
*  He actually was an italian guy who ran the number spots on statin ireland
*  You know, I used to go to italian restaurants. I can't remember it was so it felt so illegal and fucked up
*  But it was so good stand out. Yeah, man. It was like oh shit. I ain't telling nobody i'm out here. Yeah, so
*  So we tap into we tap into that culture
*  As well, so so anyway, so it was an honor to work with imagined tv
*  You know brian grazer of ron howard also blessed us running as well and uh my partner alex c who uh
*  Just a good writer, you know, he votes superfly, right the new superfly
*  And uh, he's just a good writer and our partnership led to these episodes and uh, it's a valuable right now
*  Feel to be respected
*  As a hip-hop pioneer as someone that started some different shit and like you could rock with wu-tang
*  forever
*  But you still been able to
*  like be
*  identified like you
*  You know what i'm saying, how does it feel to be go through the hip-hop thing and then being respected
*  In the film world in a writing world like you are now
*  I mean, it's a blessing of course, right you can say that without no joke. No, no strings attached. That wasn't a joke
*  It's a blessing and the beauty of it all for me for the rizza
*  Is that every step that I take and every foot point I leave I leave before hip-hop, right?
*  So you think about you know, of course, you know, dr. Dre is in front of me. He's ahead of me, you know
*  um, and so
*  You know I had his records before I had a record
*  Uh, and so I watched the nwa movie and I'm like wow, it's a movie now. It was an album. Now. It's a movie and now
*  You know, how do I take it to another level? Well now it's not a movie. It's a tv series. Wow
*  You see and now somebody else in hip-hop could take a look at that and they can say wow
*  What can we do now to take it to another level? So the biggest blessing
*  For me the biggest reward
*  Is knowing that there's footprints being left by the abbot if they call me the avid
*  But the avid is leaving footprints. So i'm showing people in hip-hop. You don't have to be
*  Crabs in the barrel or trying to say a rhyme or trying to make a beat
*  I mean you could you could you know, you could take your art
*  And put it in many forms because there's many outlets of art even an editor there's many outlets of hip-hop too
*  Yeah, even a good editor hip-hop video editor. It's a certain style to his editing, right?
*  So because he has a he has the hip-hop in him, you know, I mean, so even there's an outlet a lot of young people
*  Uh, you know in many fields we all sometimes strive towards the same
*  Goal not realizing how many people it takes to achieve the goal and through film and with this
*  Through film being one of the most collaborative art forms there is if you watch a movie you'll see
*  You know hundreds of names go by when I did my movie man with the iron fist. I had was that tarantino?
*  Yeah, yeah, yo, you know the weird thing about it like
*  man
*  Like me being on the outside and seeing you create everything man that connection felt so like
*  It was it made so much sense son. Thank you. It made so it's like
*  Duh
*  And the baddest man alive is like number two right behind the rage against machine wu-tang collaboration
*  God damn, that's a good song. God damn. Thank you. Well point being made that
*  500 people was employed. Yeah, a lot of people a lot of moving parts
*  So think about the young people out there who's trying to figure out whether their art feeling
*  Fitting whether their talent fit in and I'll say to them look it took 500 people to make that. Okay, and you never know
*  Where your talent gonna fall so we could like he told you to spit the spit 16. You gotta spit 16
*  No, no, he gotta spit 16
*  No, no, no
*  But his talking listen his talking
*  Attract millions just like
*  Yo, man only reason I did only reason this is why I wanted him to spit 16 because I knew he was going to say
*  Where's the fuck is your podcast, right?
*  I was like this before he get to the podcast. He wanted to keep you defensive already know
*  This motherfucker's voice is the voice of this whole shit
*  And a motherfucker can just sit there and talk to somebody forever
*  And not only just talking about forever that's after doing comedy
*  I was a comedy and then I got time to talk to somebody forever and I don't have to talk about none of the shit
*  I did last night. That's some crazy shit. You could do it too
*  I want y'all started 44 minutes with nobody

*  Listen, you're on the road man. You got no worries. Yeah, we're just gonna leave with a verse. Okay, hit me with it
*  What's the logistics?
*  Is my egotistic personality part of my coexistence or is it just a dangerous stranger paying me an uninvited visit?
*  Like an unwanted christmas guest or is it just a fragment of my lower self envy greed and lust
*  Or my higher self goodwill love and trust is this therapy too?
*  untherapeutic to discuss
*  I was dangling in the dirt like a pair of loose shoestrings
*  But I was born in the usa
*  Like bruce springsteen torn between the temptation of bringing the ruckus to maintaining the structure to keeping girls on my payroll that cuts
*  Your nuts off after they fuck you before you rupture
*  They try to put me in a quiet place where the words stop
*  Or put me in a closed pen space ruin life through a bird box
*  But close the windows shut the doors scatter dirt on the floor so the sound of my footsteps are dampened and absorbed
*  That's a metaphor to kill the noise
*  While they walk around we look blindfolded as they kill our boys and these crazy races roam with cold steel and they kill for joy
*  Blood spills inside the church and outside the shopping store inside the movie theater school campus and church or the synagogues
*  No location is omitted
*  Most cases get acquitted by mental illness and no guns are prohibited
*  Is it rational to think this is a national problem?
*  Therefore it's a threat to national security and the national guards needs to solve it or is it visible?
*  It's a problem of individuals who are not in court with the principle of one nation under god indivisible
*  respect to my veterans
*  Ladies and gentlemen, that's it. That's it. That's the way to end a fucking podcast
*  Whoo an honor sir. Thank you. Thank you
*  Bye everybody
*  You
