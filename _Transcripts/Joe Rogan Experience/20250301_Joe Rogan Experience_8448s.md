*  Well, you're an interesting other people are concerned for me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Oh, really? Legitimately? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=64.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if it's the I don't know why it's a weightlifter thing, because I have no I have no predisposed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=67.0s)]
*  I have no premonitions. But when I walk in here and I see. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=72.0s)]
*  I got to look at that. What is that green? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=78.0s)]
*  I think that's the local racetrack. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=81.0s)]
*  That's the Circuit of the Americas where Formula One races. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=83.0s)]
*  OK, that's my friend's place. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=86.0s)]
*  So he gave me that. OK. Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=88.0s)]
*  I walked in. I saw these Hunter Thompson things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=91.0s)]
*  I felt automatically like, OK, well, this guy can't be a complete disaster. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=93.0s)]
*  And then I walked down the hall and there's Hunter wearing a hat that I gave him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=98.0s)]
*  Oh, that hat with the gun. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=103.0s)]
*  Yeah. The one where he's in a cockpit. It looks like. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=105.0s)]
*  That's a dog hair hat. That's dog hair. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=107.0s)]
*  It's made out of dog hair. Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=109.0s)]
*  And he got such a kick out of it because when it rains on you or snows on you like it would in Woody Creek, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=111.0s)]
*  you come in the house and you smell like a wet dog. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=118.0s)]
*  And he loved like doing that to people. The people go, what in the hell? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=121.0s)]
*  Oh, that's the dog. You know, that's the dog right there. Yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=126.0s)]
*  Oh, so this is are you filming this too? This is whatever you do. Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=131.0s)]
*  Yeah. So yeah, there he is. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=135.0s)]
*  There's that dog. It's got the head like big like tie things. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=138.0s)]
*  You could tie it under your chin. What year was this? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=141.0s)]
*  This is. Oh, wow. Look at that one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=145.0s)]
*  Lawyers, guns and money. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=151.0s)]
*  Yes, those are later ones. Yeah. He did scopes for a long time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=153.0s)]
*  That was a hearing protection then, too. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=158.0s)]
*  He was learning. Well, no, we're all really something about maybe what that one there is 86 with the dog. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=162.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's probably. Yeah, it was earlier. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=171.0s)]
*  Blind, blind bat. Where's that? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=175.0s)]
*  That's funny. It's a replica. It's a historic piece, I guess. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=178.0s)]
*  When did you meet him? I met him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=182.0s)]

*  I met him. It was one of those years. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=191.0s)]
*  Maybe it was after my first real year on Saturday Night Live. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=194.0s)]
*  Maybe it was 1970. Seven like the spring summer of 77. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=197.0s)]
*  I was asked by Lorne Michaels, the producer Saturday Night Live, if I would. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=208.0s)]
*  I had to go to our season was head ended. I'd gone to California. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=212.0s)]
*  And he asked if I would drive his Volkswagen convertible bug back cross country for him. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=217.0s)]
*  I like, yeah, sure. Well, you know, a week or two later, it's like, where's my car? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=223.0s)]
*  I'm like, you didn't give me a time limit. You know, I visited people on the way. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=228.0s)]
*  So I made some stops. I never I visited my friend, John Thompson in Reno, biggest little city in the world. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=233.0s)]
*  And we were, you know, threw our cups out the roof and stuff like that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=239.0s)]
*  Had a really nice time there. And then I wanted to go to Aspen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=243.0s)]
*  I'd never been to Aspen before. And so I went to Aspen and stayed at the Jerome Hotel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=246.0s)]
*  I can talk like this because the show is like endless. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=252.0s)]
*  So I went to the Jerome Hotel, which was like the place to go back then. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=257.0s)]
*  It was off season, which is the best time of year to go to any resort town is like when all the tourists are gone [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=264.0s)]
*  and the citizens regain control of their town for a while. Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=270.0s)]
*  So the Jerome Hotel, which would have been full of like knucklehead skiers from anywhere, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=274.0s)]
*  was only full of like the people that work the town and lived in the town. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=278.0s)]
*  And they took over the bar and they took over the swimming pool, which was outside. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=282.0s)]
*  So that's I was there and it was just I remember being there and they were like beautiful girls and this really funny guy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=286.0s)]
*  And I didn't know who he was. And we just had the most fun, you know, making girls laugh. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=295.0s)]
*  That's kind of what may or may not have been the reason I was brought here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=300.0s)]
*  But, you know, that's so we just had the most fun doing it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=305.0s)]
*  And then we had this sort of episode where, you know, we did an escape act and it was that had consequences. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=309.0s)]
*  You may have started talking about an escape act, underwater escape act. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=316.0s)]
*  And I felt like I could do any really good escape underwater. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=322.0s)]
*  Oh, no. And I said, yeah, I think I could do it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=326.0s)]
*  I think I could do it because you just so we agreed to I agreed to be a subject. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=328.0s)]
*  And you have to know, I did not know who this guy was. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=336.0s)]
*  I just thought he was like a funny guy. So and we would like showing off for girls and stuff and being stupid. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=340.0s)]
*  And it was fun. We were just having fun. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=347.0s)]
*  So I was tied with socks to a lawn chair and and lowered into the pool. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=350.0s)]
*  But just before I went, I said, hey, just in case I want to take a breath while I'm untying my sock knots. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=355.0s)]
*  I would move me over here to where it's like six feet, you know. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=362.0s)]
*  So if I have to stand up, you know, I can take a breath and go back down and continue my untying. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=366.0s)]
*  So I went in and, you know, I was untying and I could tie some knots, you know, even with socks. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=374.0s)]
*  So after a little bit, I thought earlier, you know, maybe I'll just take a quick breath and go back down. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=381.0s)]
*  Well, I stood up. Well, try it, Joe. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=386.0s)]
*  Lash yourself to a chair and try to stand up. Yeah, it's hard. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=390.0s)]
*  Well, I'm I'm a little over six feet. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=393.0s)]
*  But if you're tied to a chair, you don't get to fully extend your calves any more than that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=395.0s)]
*  So tied to a chair, I'm only like five. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=402.0s)]
*  You couldn't get out of it or something like that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=406.0s)]
*  And I just it was funny to see like that camera shot of like there are people up there and I can't reach them or speak to them because I'm still underwater. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=409.0s)]
*  So that's when I started to work more fervently on the note feverishly on the on the knots. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=416.0s)]
*  And I kind of was going, hey, hey, you know, this is, you know, I'm kind of leaning with my head like push me down to five feet instead of six feet. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=423.0s)]
*  You know, so but he was strong enough. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=431.0s)]
*  And because I was buoyant in the water, he just picked up the chair out of the water. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=433.0s)]
*  So I lived through it. But it was it was a funny way to meet someone. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=437.0s)]
*  And the next day I found out that this was a Hunter S. Thompson. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=442.0s)]
*  He never asked of his name. No, he never asked me my name. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=446.0s)]
*  I don't know that he knew I was either. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=452.0s)]
*  You know, I think he thought I was just a funny guy and we were kind of like holding court and being funny. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=455.0s)]
*  Everything starts with good health. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=461.0s)]

*  You probably don't even have email, do you? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=543.0s)]

*  But if you have children, you have to have a you have to get a cell phone, right, because they will not answer a telephone, but they will answer a text. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=546.0s)]
*  So that's right. I had a breakdown. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=554.0s)]
*  Yeah. But you've managed to stay blissfully detached in some sort of way. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=556.0s)]
*  Yeah. My email is AOL dot com. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=562.0s)]
*  Is it really? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=564.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that's that's that was my concession to it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=565.0s)]
*  But one of my favorite things you did with Hunter was when it was a feeling of some sort of a documentary or something or is in a documentary, the footages. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=570.0s)]
*  And you're going around trying to convince people that Nixon got a bad rap. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=578.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that was good. We were trying to we were trying to write something funny. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=581.0s)]
*  I was with my friend Dick Plasucci on that one. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=585.0s)]
*  And I can't remember. They like two or three of us. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=588.0s)]
*  They were trying to write this thing. And we rented a like a Klieg light, you know, like a big Hollywood premiere kind of one of those giant lights that they flash up in the sky. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=591.0s)]
*  You know, you don't even see him very much anymore. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=601.0s)]
*  But and we were just outside the Chateau of Marmont where Hunter had a room at that moment. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=603.0s)]
*  And and we were doing we were excited because Nixon's back, you know, and we were interviewing alleged people on the street, men on the street saying, what do you think about this? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=608.0s)]
*  Because it was after Watergate and Nixon had basically burrowed down and and Hunter had a look of powerful hatred of Nixon really didn't like Nixon, of course. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=618.0s)]
*  But I just remember Dick Plasucci saying, I'm excited. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=630.0s)]
*  He's tanned. He's rested and he's ready. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=635.0s)]
*  I still I still say it all the time. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=639.0s)]
*  I just I say it about myself all the time because I think it's funny. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=641.0s)]
*  How are you, Bill? I'm tanned. I'm rested and I'm ready. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=644.0s)]
*  But saying it about Richard Nixon, I thought was a really brilliant thing to say. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=646.0s)]
*  Well, anyway, it became a common phrase. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=650.0s)]
*  Yeah. People use it all the time. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=652.0s)]
*  They probably not even knowing the origin. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=654.0s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=656.0s)]
*  And it's Dick Plasucci who did it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=657.0s)]
*  And and we weren't there for like 45 minutes before like I work in the industry and I know you have to have a permit to have that light on. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=659.0s)]
*  I mean, there were people they came at us. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=669.0s)]
*  We were we were going concerned for about one hour tops. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=671.0s)]
*  And that was with like professional argumentative people like Hunter, myself going, that is a fabulous watch you're wearing. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=675.0s)]
*  Where'd you get that? You know, just anything to keep this thing going and to keep the cameras rolling on our super stuff. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=683.0s)]
*  But and demands. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=689.0s)]
*  But yeah, that's that was one of the things I had a lot of fun with the guy. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=693.0s)]
*  Really. He really was a lot of fun. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=697.0s)]
*  He really can make a lot of fun. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=700.0s)]
*  I really wish I met him. He's one of those people that just really wish I met him. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=702.0s)]
*  Well, you can still read it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=706.0s)]
*  There's still so much more stuff that I didn't had name and read then. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=708.0s)]
*  It just keeps appearing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=711.0s)]
*  There are things are so beautiful that he wrote that that are good. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=713.0s)]
*  And, you know, people text me things and say, you know, what's going on, how suppression he was about things a long time ago. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=718.0s)]
*  Yeah, dead on about so many things. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=726.0s)]
*  I mean, you could take a lot of his commentary on politics from 1976 and apply it easily to today. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=728.0s)]
*  You know, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail is one of the best books ever on the American political system, just like what it's like when people are running for office. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=735.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's to me, it's a better book than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which is really fun. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=742.0s)]
*  But the Campaign Trail book is so insightful about America and and about Americans. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=749.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's great reading. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=755.0s)]
*  The movie was fun. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=757.0s)]
*  Fear and Loathing was fun. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=758.0s)]
*  It was just it was a great introduction to a lot of people maybe that weren't aware of Hunter. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=759.0s)]
*  Like maybe then you'll start reading his stuff. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=764.0s)]
*  But it's it wasn't all, you know, chaos and acid and seeing lizard people in the in the bar. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=767.0s)]
*  It was there was even there's moments in Fear and Loathing, the movie where, you know, he there's this one thing where Johnny Depp is at the typewriter. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=773.0s)]
*  Or is that in the movie or is that in the documentary? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=782.0s)]
*  Where is that? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=786.0s)]
*  The typewriter is talking about how the 1960s there was this great wave of change. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=787.0s)]
*  And then the high water market. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=794.0s)]
*  You see it on the mountains. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=796.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful, beautiful piece of writing. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=797.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=799.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=800.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=801.0s)]
*  And when Johnny Depp is saying the way saying it, it's like it's so beautiful and melodic. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=802.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=808.0s)]
*  Why don't you do it? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=809.0s)]
*  It's about the most famous. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=810.0s)]
*  It's the most famous line in the world. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=811.0s)]
*  Let's take this. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=813.0s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=814.0s)]
*  Six. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=815.0s)]
*  Grab the headphones. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=816.0s)]
*  Let's take this. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=817.0s)]
*  Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=818.0s)]
*  Has it been five years? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=822.0s)]
*  Six. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=825.0s)]
*  It seems like a lifetime. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=827.0s)]
*  The kind of peak that never comes again. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=830.0s)]
*  San Francisco in the middle 60s was a very special time and place to be a part of. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=835.0s)]
*  But no explanation. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=842.0s)]
*  No mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=844.0s)]
*  Whatever it meant. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=853.0s)]
*  There was madness in any direction. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=861.0s)]
*  At any hour. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=865.0s)]
*  You could strike sparks anywhere. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=867.0s)]
*  There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=870.0s)]
*  That we were winning. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=875.0s)]
*  And that, I think, was the handle. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=877.0s)]
*  That sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=880.0s)]
*  Not in any mean or military sense. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=885.0s)]
*  We didn't need that. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=888.0s)]
*  Our energy would simply prevail. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=891.0s)]
*  We had all the momentum. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=894.0s)]
*  We were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=897.0s)]
*  So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=902.0s)]
*  And with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high watermark. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=910.0s)]
*  That place where the wave finally broke and rolled back. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=916.0s)]
*  God damn, that's good. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=927.0s)]
*  That is just an amazing piece of writing that so perfectly captured that very strange moment in time where the anti-war, the peace love movement just got drowned out by the Nixon administration. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=930.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful piece. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=946.0s)]
*  It glistens your eyes to see it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=949.0s)]
*  Not just the thing of Hunter and the words that he said, but seeing Johnny and how close Johnny and Hunter became. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=952.0s)]
*  How much they loved each other and how much they shared with each other. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=961.0s)]
*  It's really a beautiful piece. Thank you. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=965.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is a beautiful piece. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=967.0s)]
*  And it's just so fucking perfect. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=969.0s)]
*  He got it. He really got it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=973.0s)]
*  Yeah, it just encapsulates that time. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=975.0s)]
*  And it's just, thank God there was a guy like him around to document it from that perspective. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=979.0s)]
*  To give you this insight in that the way he did it with gonzo journalism where he just would have real facts mixed in with fiction. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=986.0s)]
*  You couldn't tell what was what and you had to be in on it to understand what he was doing. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=995.0s)]
*  Yeah, you had to enter the event. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=999.0s)]
*  Yeah, you had to enter the event to comment on it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1001.0s)]
*  You had to be a part of it. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  You played him. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1008.0s)]
*  I did play him. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  We were talking about it before. I loved it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1010.0s)]
*  We were in the Buffalo Room. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were in the Buffalo Room. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1013.0s)]
*  Was that weird to play your friend? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1015.0s)]
*  It was a lot of responsibility. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1017.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  It was any actor that has to play either a living person, especially a living person, or a famous person has a real responsibility to that person. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1021.0s)]
*  You can't just be that person for 90 minutes. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1036.0s)]
*  You have to realize that person was that person for 60 some odd years or 70 or however many years a person was. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1039.0s)]
*  You've got to try to get all that into your hour and a half or two hours. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1046.0s)]
*  You've got to try to take in as much as you can so you're not lying. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1051.0s)]
*  At least you're given the best you can to say this is who I think he was. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1054.0s)]
*  This is who I think that person was. She was. He was. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1058.0s)]
*  Did you run any of it by him? Did you try to talk to him as him? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1061.0s)]
*  Well, he was living in the guest house. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  So you were around him all the time? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I would go to work and I would come home and then we would stay up and sort of just an hour or so before, maybe an hour and a half before, two hours before dawn, he'd have a Nyquil and Scotch. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  A Nyquil and Scotch in a hot tub and then go to sleep. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1097.0s)]
*  And then I had to get about 90 minutes and then the teamster was knocking on the window saying, Bill, Billy. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1103.0s)]
*  And then I'd have to go to work. That's what it was like while we were shooting the movie. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1112.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he appears in the movie briefly. He appears in the movie briefly. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1117.0s)]
*  I can't remember all of it, but he appears in the movie briefly and we did together. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1123.0s)]
*  We wrote a scene where I was always constantly changing. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  John K wrote the script, but I was always playing with it because I was always being informed more. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1131.0s)]
*  You know, and I that's what I did anyway. I just pretty much, you know, I felt the freedom to change anything. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1137.0s)]
*  But we did write a scene. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1145.0s)]
*  Hunter and I wrote a scene that was late in the movie. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  Pardon me. They gave me these beautiful, massive things. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1151.0s)]
*  Cough drops? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1157.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  Yeah. So he was in on a lot of it and the editing of it, you know, we can secretly say that too. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1165.0s)]
*  And the, and the, you know, it was a lot of, there was a lot, he was really involved. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1173.0s)]
*  Very nice. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1181.0s)]
*  So. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1182.0s)]
*  Good shot. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  So you're saying he wrote a scene? You guys wrote a scene together? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1186.0s)]
*  Yeah, we wrote a scene together, yeah. Which was encountering Nixon in a urinal. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1188.0s)]
*  Because he did have a moment with Nixon where. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1194.0s)]
*  Yes. In the limo. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  Remember, yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1198.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  Well, he could not speak politics. They could only talk NFL football. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1200.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1203.0s)]
*  Which Nixon was rather, you know, knowledgeable about. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1204.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1208.0s)]
*  Hunter Copter was like, yeah, the guy really studied it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1209.0s)]
*  And George Allen, he, it's in the book, you know, but. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1212.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1215.0s)]
*  He, Nixon even wrote a, designed a play that he gave to George Allen, who was the coach of the Washington Redskins back then. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1216.0s)]
*  And it was like, it was a, they lost like 10 yards or something on the play, but Allen actually played, ran the play. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1224.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1231.0s)]
*  Nixon's play. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1232.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1233.0s)]
*  It's just also insane that they would let Hunter get in a limousine with the president. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  Like just that alone. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1240.0s)]
*  Like who, you know, who greenlit that? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1242.0s)]
*  Who thought that was a good idea? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1246.0s)]
*  Well, he was, he'd been on the, I mean, he was on the campaign trail. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1248.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1251.0s)]
*  For whatever he was, the people who knew, and you know, like Secret Service guys, you ever run into them, they like read people for a living. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1252.0s)]
*  This is what they do, you know. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1260.0s)]
*  They read people and they can really burn a hole through your head and your body just looking at you. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1262.0s)]
*  And they'll give you this one, you know, they'll just really burn you. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1269.0s)]
*  And, you know, he'd been on the tour, the tour, he'd been on the road with them. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1272.0s)]
*  They knew who he was. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1277.0s)]
*  They knew what he was after hours and they knew what he was during hours where the people who were really smart knew this guy's really smart. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1279.0s)]
*  This guy's really smart. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1286.0s)]
*  He knows politics. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1287.0s)]
*  And you can't try to dumb down. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1290.0s)]
*  You can't try to like big time him because he'll kill you. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1292.0s)]
*  He'll chop you. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1295.0s)]
*  He's got the words to answer and he has the intelligence. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1296.0s)]
*  So he was, he was a force. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1301.0s)]
*  People knew who he was, you know, even the, you know, to get information. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1303.0s)]
*  You got to go into the people who work for the guy, you know. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1308.0s)]
*  So the people that work for the guy know who he is and they've already established that they have a relationship with him. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1312.0s)]
*  They can speak with him. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1318.0s)]
*  He's talking a certain way. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1319.0s)]
*  There's a reality check. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1321.0s)]
*  You know, if you're running someone's political campaign, you have the best jokes about the campaign, you know, not Hunter Thompson, maybe. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1322.0s)]
*  You have the best jokes because you've seen it all. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1329.0s)]
*  You know how stupid things get. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1331.0s)]
*  And, you know, if you can be realistic and savvy about those things and people trust you. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1333.0s)]
*  Well, it's still pretty extraordinary that they also got him to agree or at least thought he would agree that he would only talk about football. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1338.0s)]
*  Well, he knew if he blew it, that was it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1348.0s)]
*  And that was going to be the end of it. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1350.0s)]
*  And it was only, you know, I don't know what month it was, but there's more coffee in this. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1351.0s)]
*  Oh, is that your stuff? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1356.0s)]
*  No, that's everybody's. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1357.0s)]
*  OK, well, we'll try to finish it off. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1359.0s)]
*  It's hot. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1361.0s)]
*  I just feel like yours is probably doesn't have to be super. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1362.0s)]
*  I keep coffee for days, at least two days. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1365.0s)]
*  If it's not hot, it's got ice. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1368.0s)]
*  You just keep drinking? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1370.0s)]
*  I just keep drinking. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1371.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1372.0s)]
*  That smells good. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1373.0s)]
*  What kind is that? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1374.0s)]
*  Black rifle coffee. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1375.0s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  It's an American company, veteran owned company that made by real coffee nuts that travel around the world and find different blends and different. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1378.0s)]
*  It smells good. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1388.0s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1389.0s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1390.0s)]
*  Very good coffee. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1391.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just that that meeting in the limousine is like one of my favorite meetings because it just you could feel how weird it must have been for Hunter to be sitting in a limo, getting a ride with Nixon. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1392.0s)]
*  And they're just talking about football and that they can find common ground. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1407.0s)]
*  This is happening. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1410.0s)]
*  This has been happening in my life anyway, and I'm sure it's having in everyone's life for the last got to be 10 years where you meet people. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1411.0s)]
*  We have something in common. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1420.0s)]
*  We've got a we've got a something we got to get done. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1421.0s)]
*  You know, but if we talk politics, we're leaving the rails. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1425.0s)]
*  You know, all hell's going to, you know, we're not going to get along. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1430.0s)]
*  We're not going to get anything done. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1433.0s)]
*  We're never going to be friends. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1435.0s)]
*  And and, you know, it could get be worse than that. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1437.0s)]
*  We could be we could be adversaries or even enemies or right. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1440.0s)]
*  You know, so that I mean, it's you mentioned it's like I go places where I'm sure you do too, where you just can't talk. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1444.0s)]
*  You just don't want to talk politics with people because there are people that are, you know, whose politics can be the exact opposite of yours completely. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1454.0s)]
*  12 to 6. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  And yet there are people that have lived lives that are so extraordinary and so enormous in terms of what they give to the world and the planet. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1464.0s)]
*  And you think, well, how, you know, why would I like ever want to get how it's a mystery? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1475.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of a mystery, but it's. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  If you don't like value that first, instead of your kind of political, you know, handkerchief, you know, you're you're making more of a mess. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1486.0s)]
*  You know, that's kind of what's. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  You know, that's that's what I feel a lot about what's going on in anywhere, everywhere, you know, that people are leading with their their handkerchief and not their not with their whole self, you know, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1499.0s)]
*  what they understand about what living is. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1511.0s)]
*  I agree 100 percent. I think that we're just too tribally divided and people look at it like it's us versus them. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1514.0s)]
*  They enjoy the comfort of being a part of a tribe. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1521.0s)]
*  They lock on to whatever ideologies the tribe support. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1524.0s)]
*  And then anybody who opposes that is somehow another of the enemy. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  And it's just a it's a division tactic that's been used by the people that actually run the government, the actual world itself. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1531.0s)]
*  The real people of this world, especially the people of this country, have mostly share the same common core needs. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1539.0s)]
*  You want to be healthy. You want to have a good family. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1547.0s)]
*  You want to be able to make a living. You want to live in a safe place. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1550.0s)]
*  You want your kids to be able to go to a good school. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1553.0s)]
*  You want everybody to prosper and have a good time. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1556.0s)]
*  That's most of what life is. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1558.0s)]
*  All this other shit that people get so goddamn caught up in. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1560.0s)]
*  Most of it has very little to do with you. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1565.0s)]
*  And you get locked into it like it's 100 percent of your identity. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1567.0s)]
*  And the next thing you know, anybody who opposes you is Hitler. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1571.0s)]
*  And it just gets. That's true. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1574.0s)]
*  It gets so toxic. His name gets me into a lot lately, doesn't it? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1577.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good one. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1581.0s)]
*  But you sort of started it by saying by bringing up that quotation of hunters, which is so and I think about that all the time. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1582.0s)]
*  I can not but I think about it regularly. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1589.0s)]
*  Like what was that that force that that movement had that antiwar movement, whatever that was, you know, it wasn't perfect. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1594.0s)]
*  You know, it wasn't perfect. I think the thing that if if if I had regret anything or anyone regrets anything about it was the sort of hostility that was shown towards the actual servicemen. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1604.0s)]
*  Right. Most of whom were drafted. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1615.0s)]
*  Right. You know, right. To fight, you know, so that those service people had an experience that I will never have. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1617.0s)]
*  I was in a military movie. That's as good as it ever got for me. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1624.0s)]
*  But there's the thing about being in war together with people is everybody hates war. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1627.0s)]
*  And who could hate it more than someone that was there? Right. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1633.0s)]
*  But the sort of camaraderie that you had is an experience. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1636.0s)]
*  I'll never have that. I'll never have that thing that Rambo had. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1639.0s)]
*  You know, I'll never have that thing. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  And I don't think that I think that the sort of there could have been more vision about who's who we're talking to or who we're talking to about whatever kind of change you want to make. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1647.0s)]
*  And so that the agents of it are not necessarily the architects, like you say, the people who are making this tribal thing. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1660.0s)]
*  They're not the agents of it. You know, they're the architects of it. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1668.0s)]
*  And how do you get how do you jump over or how do you, you know, excuse or not excuses in the word, but how do you unite miss the people that are the agents who are just people that have a job or whatever it is. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1671.0s)]
*  They're they're they're doing their work to survive and live, whatever it is. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1688.0s)]
*  How do you get to the architects with whatever you feel is, is that what could be a shared experience and get them to like sort of dissolve the creation of the tribal tribal world. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1694.0s)]
*  I think it's you. You asked a great question. You know, you have people on here, I guess, that know, you know, or think about those things and have the ability to do something about it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1707.0s)]
*  I don't think I have the ability to do anything more than something for myself, mostly. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1717.0s)]
*  You do, because you have the ability to express yourself and you're an example. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1723.0s)]
*  And a lot of times when someone is a very reasonable, intelligent person like you and you express yourself, other people get inspired to maybe reexamine the way they're looking at things. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1727.0s)]
*  Well, that's that's a nice hope. I hope that maybe that'll happen. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1736.0s)]
*  I think that's maybe one of the right back at you then. OK. Thank you. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1740.0s)]
*  Because part of our problem in this country is that we're in competition every two years. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1743.0s)]
*  Every two years you have midterms. It is crazy. Elections every four years. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1748.0s)]
*  So we don't get a break. No, we don't get a break. We don't get a break from these people. No, we don't get a break. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1751.0s)]
*  We don't get a break from division. We don't get a break from propaganda. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1755.0s)]
*  We don't get a break from new threats. We don't get a break. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1759.0s)]
*  It's like every day it's a new thing and it keeps us completely in this constant state of stress and anxiety and also this fear of being overcome. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1763.0s)]
*  Like your side's going to lose the bad people. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1776.0s)]
*  We're going to lose the Internet. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1779.0s)]
*  We're supposed to be on watch or something. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1783.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very, very stressful and it's not healthy for human beings to be constantly in this state of competition and stress. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1785.0s)]
*  It's bad for us. And then on top of that, you have most people are addicted to social media. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1792.0s)]
*  So you're constantly getting inundated with the worst fucking things in the world all day long. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1796.0s)]
*  And you're freaking out. It's terrible for you. It's fucking terrible for you. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1801.0s)]
*  I mean, that footage made me cry. Now you're going to make me cry. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1806.0s)]
*  OK, no, it's but it's it's true. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1808.0s)]
*  It's someone's got to there has to be some sort of a new I don't know if it has to be a club, but you know, there's got to be some sort of new. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1810.0s)]
*  You know, it used to be music. I think music played such a big part of of whatever that movement was, whatever you call the peace movement or the hippies or, you know, whatever it was. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1818.0s)]
*  It was a it was an extraordinary moment in time. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1830.0s)]
*  And the music was part of the part of the experience and part of the it brought the message. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1833.0s)]
*  And it sort of it crashed through everybody's brain. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1840.0s)]
*  You know, it wasn't there wasn't a side to it. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1843.0s)]
*  Right. It's like, what were the soldiers listening to in Vietnam? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1845.0s)]
*  Jimi Hendrix. Yeah. You know, you know, we're all listening to the same stuff no matter where you were. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1849.0s)]
*  Yeah. No matter where you were, you were listening to the same music, no matter what your politic thing was. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1855.0s)]
*  The music sort of told a story and sort of said suggested a possibility. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1860.0s)]
*  So and the music was so much different than the music of the past. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1866.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it was like you go from nineteen fifty nine to nineteen sixty nine. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1870.0s)]
*  You're dealing with a completely different dimension. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1874.0s)]
*  And it's because it was all psychedelically inspired. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1877.0s)]
*  And that was another thing that the Nixon administration did. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1880.0s)]
*  They passed that sweeping Schedule One psychedelics act, made everything illegal and just threw water on the whole movement. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1882.0s)]
*  And then everything changes. Then you have the 70s. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1890.0s)]
*  Music starts getting weird in the 80s. It completely falls apart. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1892.0s)]
*  Cars start looking like shit. People start dressing stupid. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1895.0s)]
*  Now you're talking. Yeah. Now you're talking. It got weird. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1899.0s)]
*  It's a real language. You know, it's like when I never tied at all to the sweeping thing. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1901.0s)]
*  But when you revisit that, you realize how much harm that did that kind of lawmaking. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1909.0s)]
*  But let's all agree that the cars don't look as good as they used to. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1917.0s)]
*  OK, let's let's who is who are those people that say they're the really good problem solvers? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1921.0s)]
*  I see them every once in a while and they go like, how does he do it? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1925.0s)]
*  Well, first I say, what can we agree on? OK, so we can agree that cars don't look so good no more. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1928.0s)]
*  You know, well, they look good. It used to be that every single year, every single car looked different. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1935.0s)]
*  Yes. And it looked the year before. Yes. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1941.0s)]
*  And that's mind boggling nowadays to think about that. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1943.0s)]
*  And even now with the cars are made of plastic. What are they made of? They're made of shit. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  They're made of nothing. They're not made of steel. They did it with steel back then. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1951.0s)]
*  Right. And now they're made with some sort of carbon something or other. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1954.0s)]
*  And you would think they would be able to like I don't know what a 3D printer is. I have to confess. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1959.0s)]
*  I have no idea. We actually talked about it yesterday. I have no idea. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1964.0s)]
*  The biggest one is four feet long. The biggest one is four feet long. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1969.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what Elon was saying. They're not so good. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1972.0s)]
*  You can't make giant things. You can't make anything bigger than four feet. I don't think so. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1974.0s)]
*  I mean maybe there's some like super. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1979.0s)]
*  I mean if you have a car, if you have a fender bender, there's like seven parts that you have to replace. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1981.0s)]
*  Panels and panels and panels. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1987.0s)]
*  But that's also because they're better structurally to withstand impact. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1989.0s)]
*  They have these crumple layers and they're designed in a way that makes it safer for you. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1992.0s)]
*  They're a lot safer than old cars. I fucking love old cars. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1996.0s)]
*  And the sound systems are better. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=1999.0s)]
*  But new cars look great. New cars are awesome. There's a lot of like really good looking American cars. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2001.0s)]
*  A lot of really good looking German cars. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2008.0s)]
*  What happened in the 1970s and the 1980s was a drop off. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2010.0s)]
*  A significant drop off in the 60s. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2013.0s)]
*  The 60s cars were some of the best looking cars of all time. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2015.0s)]
*  Like a 65 Corvette. What a greatest looking car the world's ever designed. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2018.0s)]
*  I think that was a 62 Corvette. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2023.0s)]
*  Oh, those are beautiful too. Model 1. The first one. Generation 1. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2024.0s)]
*  But like you know, Camaros and Barracudas. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2028.0s)]
*  Like they made beautiful wild looking cars back then. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2032.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of that had to do with just the way creativity was encouraged in the 1960s. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2035.0s)]
*  It was more free flowing. The music was completely radical and different. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2045.0s)]
*  Politics was radical and different. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2049.0s)]
*  And that's why they passed those laws. They passed those laws to stop the anti-war movement. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2051.0s)]
*  It was the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2056.0s)]
*  And the guy they put in charge was a man who had absolutely no qualifications. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2058.0s)]
*  Who had no qualifications to do any of that. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2061.0s)]
*  I've got someone, a friend, that's been trying to get me to do a movie about it. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2064.0s)]
*  But the person responsible for making all the laws was someone who had absolutely no background in any of the fields. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2072.0s)]
*  No knowledge whatsoever. Just a total huckster that got himself out in front. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2079.0s)]
*  Well, they probably had a mandate. They gave them a mandate. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2083.0s)]
*  This is what we're going to do. This is the plan. We're going to lock up all these hippies. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2085.0s)]
*  I'll carry the flag. I'll carry the flag. Whatever it is. I'll run up the hill. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2089.0s)]
*  I'll run up the hill. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2093.0s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2094.0s)]
*  Well, I heard that Buick is going to make a car. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  And this could be wrong. But I heard they're going to make a car next year that's not going to look like any car ever. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2104.0s)]
*  It's going to be like a brand new, whatever the hell, 25 or 26 Buick. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2110.0s)]
*  And it's not going to look like the 24 or 25. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2116.0s)]
*  It's going to look like its own individual thing that they're going to try to read to read to recommence the idea of making a new car every year. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2119.0s)]
*  You didn't hear this? No. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2129.0s)]
*  Like a completely new kind of model. Yeah. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2130.0s)]
*  Like the idea that you would make a car that didn't look like every I mean, like you can look at a car and go like that's a Volvo. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2132.0s)]
*  But that part of it looks like a Mercedes. That part of it looks like an Infiniti. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2139.0s)]
*  That part of the car looks like, you know, a Toyota. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2143.0s)]
*  You've heard probably the story about the what's that car called? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2146.0s)]
*  The Ford that's got a animal name. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2151.0s)]
*  Mustang? Taurus. Taurus. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2154.0s)]
*  Now there's a story. Now it could be apocryphal. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2156.0s)]
*  That the Ford Taurus. You never heard this one? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2158.0s)]
*  I thought you were like this guy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2161.0s)]
*  Taurus is a piece of shit. I don't care about Taurus's. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2163.0s)]
*  Well, the Taurus. Yeah. The Taurus is like it's not the most beautiful car in the world. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2165.0s)]
*  But it was a huge seller for Ford. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2169.0s)]
*  They sold a lot of them. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2173.0s)]
*  And the story is that these guys at Ford designed a car and they took the rear quarter panel from this automobile, the fender from this, the back fender from this, the rear windows from this, and just did a composite of all these different cars. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2175.0s)]
*  And the car was, this car is bullshit. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  And we'll call it the Taurus. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2198.0s)]
*  And they presented it to Ford who went, we love it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2200.0s)]
*  And then proceeded to sell hundreds of thousands of them. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2203.0s)]
*  And this is a story. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2207.0s)]
*  Where's your phone calls here? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2209.0s)]
*  Faye, caller number one. You heard about this? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2211.0s)]
*  No one's ever heard this story? You've never heard this one? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2213.0s)]
*  I've never heard that. No. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2215.0s)]
*  But I believe it. It makes sense. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2217.0s)]
*  You can believe it if you look at the cars that are put in now. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2218.0s)]
*  That they are absolutely like, look at that damn Volvo. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2221.0s)]
*  It looks exactly like a three year ago Mercedes or something like that. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2224.0s)]
*  They just really just steal. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2228.0s)]
*  Jamie, pull up 2024 Shelby Mustang Super Snake. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2231.0s)]
*  So there's still some cars. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2237.0s)]
*  Better yet, Jamie, roll it in here. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2239.0s)]
*  Just check out what this looks like. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2240.0s)]
*  There's cars that they make today that are unique looking and look badass. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2242.0s)]
*  I wish I'd bought a Shelby back when I first had a paycheck. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2246.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. They're such beautiful cars. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2249.0s)]
*  Look at that. Come on. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2251.0s)]
*  Well that kind of funny, funny when I first look at it, it looks a little Chevy to me. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2252.0s)]
*  It does a little bit. It could be like a Camaro. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2256.0s)]
*  I mean look at that. That looks like Chevy. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2258.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a beautiful car though, right? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2260.0s)]
*  Well, you know, you could photograph either of us from a certain angle. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2263.0s)]
*  No, no. I've seen that one in real life. That's a beautiful car. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  That's a beautiful car. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2270.0s)]
*  That's better. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2272.0s)]
*  Oh, and it sounds amazing. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2273.0s)]
*  But I'd hate to hit anything with that thing. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2275.0s)]
*  In what way? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2276.0s)]
*  I would hate to bump into anything. It looks like I'd have to... [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2277.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have to replace a lot of shit. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2280.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2282.0s)]
*  Can you big up that picture there? What's the rear look like? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2283.0s)]
*  Oh, it's got a spoiler? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2288.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2289.0s)]
*  How do you feel about spoilers? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2290.0s)]
*  That looks fucking badass. That thing looks awesome. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2292.0s)]
*  That looks amazing. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2295.0s)]
*  Well, I think the original one is like the super coolest car. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2297.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Oh, no doubt. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2301.0s)]
*  I mean, if you go back and look at like, pull up a Boss 429, 1969, Boss 429. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2303.0s)]
*  This to me is the pinnacle of muscle car design, is the Boss 429. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2310.0s)]
*  Like that is just spectacular. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2315.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2318.0s)]
*  Well, that's pretty close. Well, that's got that scoop in the front. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2319.0s)]
*  That's pretty close to the Bullitt year, right? The Bullitt car? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2322.0s)]
*  68, yeah. Bullitt was 68. I actually have a recreation of that. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2325.0s)]
*  I was watching it. Did you know they found the original Bullitt car? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2329.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2332.0s)]
*  I was reading about that this week. So it was on TV last week. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2333.0s)]
*  And I've watched it a lot of times, that movie, because, you know, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2336.0s)]
*  I think Stephen Crain is pretty damn good. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2341.0s)]
*  But when you watch the movie, it's obviously the roaring through San Francisco [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2344.0s)]
*  and all that sort of stuff it's famous for. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2349.0s)]
*  And then there's the ending where there's, the sort of story ends with kind of a flaming crash. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2351.0s)]
*  You know, it's kind of not really kind of an ending in a way. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2356.0s)]
*  But watching it this particular time, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2360.0s)]
*  it was all the moments in between all that that really make the movie. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2364.0s)]
*  Yes. All the quiet in between where he's in the grocery store, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2368.0s)]
*  he's with the girl, he's at the mailbox, he's seeing these people and these people. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2372.0s)]
*  And he has this very quiet inner self that's dealing with people very respectfully. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2376.0s)]
*  And his blood pressure only moves, the needle only starts to move when he gets with the bad guy, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2382.0s)]
*  Chalmers, who's obviously a fraud of some sort. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2388.0s)]
*  And he's got him like, you see him like, not just as an actor keeping his cool, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2392.0s)]
*  but as like a cop keeping his cool with like a person he knows is trying to use him. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2397.0s)]
*  And just watching that part of the performance and that part of the story was much more interesting. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2402.0s)]
*  The first time I saw all that as its own weave through it, you know. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2408.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2412.0s)]
*  The car stuff had very little to do with what I was getting from the people. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2413.0s)]
*  The car stuff was nothing. And his boss was a great actor, Simon Oakland, I think his name is. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2418.0s)]
*  He was great as his boss who said, I'm going to hold this till Monday morning. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2424.0s)]
*  You know, that kind of guy. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2429.0s)]
*  There was some great acting in that. It's a really beautiful American movie like that. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2432.0s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought that up because it's one of the things that I love about that movie [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2437.0s)]
*  and Lamont's another great Steve McQueen movie is that he had these moments [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2442.0s)]
*  and you could do that in a movie back then where no one was talking for minutes and minutes at a time. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2448.0s)]
*  There's a lot of quiet in Bullet, a lot of quiet. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2453.0s)]
*  Yes. It's just you're taking in this story, but it's very compelling. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2456.0s)]
*  And sometimes there's not even any music, right? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2461.0s)]
*  Like in Lamont's the whole first part of it, there's no talking at all for quite a while. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2464.0s)]
*  It's just like you're getting the sounds and the feeling of being this race car driver [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2470.0s)]
*  and he's driving his 911 down this country road. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2475.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's it's it engrosses you in a different way. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2479.0s)]
*  It pulls you into the story. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2483.0s)]
*  Bullet worries, right? And what movie is he driving like a dune buggy? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2485.0s)]
*  Is that bullet two or is that no, that's the other one. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2489.0s)]
*  The one in Boston. That's a pretty good movie, too. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2493.0s)]
*  Which one's that? Oh, come on. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2496.0s)]
*  They remade it. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2498.0s)]
*  Prasit Thomas Crown Affair. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2500.0s)]
*  Yeah. And obviously he's having time. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2503.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, we shoot some stuff in a dune buggy and basically they had like a whole day. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2505.0s)]
*  Yeah, this. Yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2509.0s)]
*  And he's having a time. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2512.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, he's got Faye Dunaway and they're going, I hope that's Faye Dunaway anyway. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2515.0s)]
*  Roaring around and he could really drive, right? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2521.0s)]
*  He got a really dry car. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2524.0s)]
*  He could really drive like you could really flip one of these fucking things if you're driving like for sure. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2526.0s)]
*  I don't know what you're sure. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2530.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's going sideways. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2532.0s)]
*  She is she is having the time of her life. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2534.0s)]
*  Look at that spinning it out in the water with a movie star who doesn't even have a seatbelt on probably. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2536.0s)]
*  No, they didn't have seatbelts back then. Jesus Christ. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2542.0s)]
*  Well, she might have a seatbelt. She looks like she's built. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2545.0s)]
*  But that was cool. He was like the archetypal archetypal movie star. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2547.0s)]
*  He was a movie star like that. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2552.0s)]
*  That guy was a movie star. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2553.0s)]
*  You know, there was something about him that was compelling. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2555.0s)]
*  He lived his life in this sort of wild renegade way and drove race cars and he was a man's man. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2558.0s)]
*  And when you saw him in a movie, you believed it. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2564.0s)]
*  Well, I've been watching. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2566.0s)]
*  I've come to be watching all the old cowboy shows on the satellite. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2568.0s)]
*  I watch all the old cowboy shows and wanted dinner. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2573.0s)]
*  Dead or Alive was always a super cool show. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2576.0s)]
*  And I've been watching it just to see what the hell is he up to? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2578.0s)]
*  I mean, he is just no one was getting away with that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2581.0s)]
*  No one was doing what he was doing, which was so small and so slight. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2585.0s)]
*  He was really preparing himself to be a movie actor, you know, because his his performances is so controlled. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2590.0s)]
*  He's so in his skin, you know, and he's always got like a piece of business to do. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2598.0s)]
*  He always had a piece of business to do like something to do. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2603.0s)]
*  Like the way he like strapped on his goofy sawed off rifle and stuff. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2607.0s)]
*  You know, you keep thinking it's a sort of shotgun. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2612.0s)]
*  It's a sawed off rifle. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2614.0s)]
*  You know, so just all his moves were very little. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2616.0s)]
*  His face gave very, very little away. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2621.0s)]
*  He would pout, do a half pout kind of stuff. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2624.0s)]
*  And it's just fun to watch him see how little he could do and get it done. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2627.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2631.0s)]
*  And get it across. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2632.0s)]
*  I like that about him. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2633.0s)]
*  But he always had like he kind of challenged himself to do something physical. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2635.0s)]
*  Like, so if he'd be talking to you, he'd be he'd have just even that even something like that to be like, you know, come in here. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2640.0s)]
*  He would just the way he did it was a guy who had a real natural way with his body. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2647.0s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2652.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he would just draw you in and in all of his films and just it's like in a way that was it was just different. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2653.0s)]
*  It's like it was a different presence on screen. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2660.0s)]
*  What is that guy? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2662.0s)]
*  Sawed off rifle. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2663.0s)]
*  See, it's a sawed off. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2665.0s)]
*  It's not a shotgun. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2666.0s)]
*  It's a rifle. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2667.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2668.0s)]
*  When he had see that little shtick he's got he's got it so it locks in and then swings back. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2671.0s)]
*  So he could actually if he wished to, I better hope you better not wish to against you two. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2675.0s)]
*  He could just sort of swivel it and fire while it's still attached to his waistband. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2680.0s)]
*  I never saw this show. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2685.0s)]

*  But there were some Lone Rangers. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2767.0s)]
*  The Lone Ranger came on and then the guy I didn't realize it because there's some Lone [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2769.0s)]
*  Rangers where it's not our Lone Ranger being the Lone Ranger and who wasn't as good as our Lone Ranger. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2774.0s)]
*  And then our Lone Ranger comes back and it turns out I finally figured out that he he sort of went on strike. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2779.0s)]
*  He said he wanted a contract raise after the first season or something. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2784.0s)]
*  They like said, no, they went ahead and made a season with this other guy and people went, when are you going to kill off the Lone Ranger? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2787.0s)]
*  You know, no offense to that man's family. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=2794.0s)]

*  OK, we can do it. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3182.44s)]
*  I wasn't there you go. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3183.44s)]
*  Slap some headphones on. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3187.84s)]
*  Oh, no slim jumps. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3188.84s)]
*  Past two hours, you've been passing gas like a very sick infant. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3189.84s)]
*  I got to breathe all day. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3195.2s)]
*  Sorry, I had a lot of coffee. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3196.2s)]
*  OK, sorry. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3197.2s)]
*  And then you use my name. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3198.2s)]
*  Jesus Christ, Lonnie. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3199.2s)]
*  You catch our names, why any chance? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3200.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, he called you Lefty and you called him Lonnie. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3203.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, I overreacted. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3207.72s)]
*  OK. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3210.72s)]
*  Son, we got to talk about Lefty. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3211.72s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3216.72s)]
*  Stop it! [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3219.72s)]
*  You killed my mom. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3222.72s)]
*  Stop it! [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3226.24s)]
*  You killed his son. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3229.24s)]
*  You're gonna kill us. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3231.24s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3234.24s)]
*  I get horny when I'm scared. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3235.24s)]
*  I'm married. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3236.24s)]
*  Oh, gas. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3237.24s)]
*  It's just us in this shitty wildlife, you know? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3238.24s)]
*  This is our son. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3241.24s)]
*  We're too young to be grandparents. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3244.24s)]
*  All because your son couldn't pull out in time. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3246.24s)]
*  We've got houseguests. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3249.24s)]
*  I would categorize these as a must kill. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3252.7599999999998s)]
*  What are we? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3257.7599999999998s)]
*  Family. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3258.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3259.7599999999998s)]
*  Can I get you anything? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3260.7599999999998s)]
*  I'd sell my left tit for an Advil and a cup of coffee. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3262.7599999999998s)]
*  You said what? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3266.7599999999998s)]
*  Who was first? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3272.7599999999998s)]
*  There was this food incident, Rocko, with pubes and my wonton soup. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3273.7599999999998s)]
*  If it's OK, I would just really like to torture him a little bit if it's OK. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3276.7599999999998s)]
*  Shouldn't have done that, Rocko. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3282.28s)]
*  Yeah, knock yourself out. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3284.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3285.28s)]
*  Are we all gonna die? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3286.28s)]
*  We don't have all night! [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3292.28s)]
*  Wait for me before you two start hitting each other. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3296.28s)]
*  You know, once you start killing it, it sort of becomes your de facto solution for every problem. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3304.28s)]
*  What? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3308.28s)]
*  Get off of me! [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3312.28s)]
*  Gosh. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3313.28s)]
*  I'm not gonna. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3314.28s)]
*  Come on. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3315.28s)]
*  I'm not gonna, Ruth. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3316.28s)]
*  What's that? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3317.28s)]
*  Shame. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3318.28s)]
*  You were gonna put something that hard to waste. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3319.28s)]
*  Huh? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3324.28s)]
*  That looks fun. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3327.28s)]
*  Uh, yeah. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3328.28s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's... [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3329.28s)]
*  They gave you too much as far as I'm concerned, but... [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3332.28s)]
*  They always do though, right? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3335.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3336.28s)]
*  Sometimes... [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3337.28s)]
*  Not always. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3338.28s)]
*  Not always. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3339.28s)]
*  But it's... [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3340.28s)]
*  It's kind of nicer to see as a surprise. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3341.8s)]
*  Oh, should we not have seen the trailer? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3343.8s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3345.8s)]
*  I mean, what are we gonna do? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3346.8s)]
*  But some people will think, I must see that, but I guarantee you this movie is really, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3347.8s)]
*  really funny. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3353.2000000000003s)]
*  I love a movie where I don't get to see the trailer. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3354.2000000000003s)]
*  I really do. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3356.0s)]
*  I would say, yeah, you could say... [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3357.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could not show the trailer. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3359.0s)]
*  That would be OK. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3360.5600000000004s)]
*  There was one... [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3362.1600000000003s)]
*  I saw one that was just the first part of that, and then they just added this... [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3363.1600000000003s)]
*  And I was hoping that was what it was, but... [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3367.8s)]
*  This kind of makes it seem like a little bit... [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3370.32s)]
*  Pustaneska. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3373.32s)]
*  It's just a little bit too much stuff in it. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3376.32s)]
*  A little bit too much stuff for me. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3378.32s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3380.32s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3381.32s)]
*  Yeah, we can think about it. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3382.32s)]
*  But anyway, it's good. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3383.32s)]
*  It looks great. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3386.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3387.32s)]
*  So, Jennifer Coolidge has got some unbelievable things to say in the movie. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3388.32s)]
*  She's got some amazing things to say. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3391.32s)]
*  And Ed Harris is really, really good in the movie. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3393.32s)]
*  I had no idea about... [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3396.84s)]
*  We were sidekicks in the movie, and we had a very good time, did some good stuff. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3398.96s)]
*  This Louis Pullman, who's Bill Pullman's son, is really good. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3404.88s)]
*  And Emanuela, she got an Italian, Pustacchini, like that. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3410.88s)]
*  She's just wonderful and beautiful. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3415.52s)]
*  And Gabby Union. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3418.84s)]
*  I call her Gabby. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3420.2000000000003s)]
*  Gabrielle Union. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3421.2000000000003s)]
*  And Miles, whose last name I can't remember, because I just want to call him Miles Davis, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3423.08s)]
*  but that little kid in there. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3426.68s)]
*  He plays the voice of the Electric Junior Bunny show or something like that on Nickelodeon [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3431.2799999999997s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3439.3199999999997s)]
*  He does like weird cartoon voices. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3440.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3442.2799999999997s)]
*  So, if you watch a lot of Nickelodeon cartoons... [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3443.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't anymore. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3446.08s)]
*  My kids are teenagers now. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3447.08s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3448.48s)]
*  I used to. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3449.48s)]
*  I used to. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3450.48s)]
*  I can tell you all about Nehow Kylan. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3452.88s)]
*  Oh, see, I don't know that one. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3453.88s)]
*  I guess SpongeBob. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3456.44s)]
*  My brother plays the Flying Dutchman on SpongeBob. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3458.72s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3462.52s)]
*  So, I watched a lot of that, but that's about it. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3463.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3466.04s)]
*  I'm way behind. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3467.04s)]
*  How do you decide what projects to pick? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3468.04s)]
*  It's really just what... [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3471.4s)]
*  Well, there are certain people, like with people that I've worked with before, there [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3473.04s)]
*  are some, like Wes Anderson is one, and Jim Jarmusch and Sofia Coppola are others. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3478.76s)]
*  And those three people call and say, I got something. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3486.36s)]
*  I just say, okay, when? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3488.76s)]
*  Because I know that they're... [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3491.7200000000003s)]
*  I know they know what I can do, and they know they look out for me, and they treat people [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3495.44s)]
*  well. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3502.1200000000003s)]
*  I love them as people, and I love them as artists. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3503.1200000000003s)]
*  So, that's just a thing. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3504.96s)]
*  The other ones are more like... [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3507.16s)]
*  You have to read the script, because people... [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3513.2400000000002s)]
*  The script is pretty much... [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3516.28s)]
*  If the script's not there, I mean, I can always help improve a script, but if the basic thing [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3517.56s)]
*  isn't there, it's like... [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3524.44s)]
*  I was scratching it one the other day, and I'm writing, and I'm going, what the hell [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3525.44s)]
*  am I doing this for? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3529.96s)]
*  This is just terrible. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3530.96s)]
*  Every page is like... [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3531.96s)]
*  But if it's not good, and usually, you know in like five pages, whether or not to even [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3534.92s)]
*  continue reading the script at all. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3542.48s)]
*  So a lot of it's based on relationships and people that you trust and know. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3546.56s)]
*  Those are very few. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3549.84s)]
*  There's only very few people that I have those kinds of relationships with, and I've done [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3550.92s)]
*  like multiple jobs with them, and they kill every time. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3554.84s)]
*  They're good. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3558.88s)]
*  They're really good. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3559.88s)]
*  So when they call, it's like, you don't have to waste my time telling me the story. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3561.4s)]
*  Just send me the thing. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3565.56s)]
*  You don't have to waste any time I'm in. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3566.56s)]
*  You can count on me. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3568.76s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3569.76s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3570.76s)]
*  I love that. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3571.76s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3572.76s)]
*  God, that's such a great feeling when you trust someone that much, and you're so enthusiastic [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3573.76s)]
*  about working with them. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3577.04s)]
*  Yeah, it means like great. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3578.04s)]
*  And people make the making of a movie part of their living. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3579.64s)]
*  This is probably the most extreme example in that we all live in a quasi dormitory. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3586.52s)]
*  We take over a small hotel in some small city, and all the actors and the key crew live in [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3594.2s)]
*  the hotel. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3601.6s)]
*  And you come down for breakfast in the morning, and people pad down in their slippers and [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3602.6s)]
*  their jammies, and they have coffee and stuff, and they look at the newspaper and say, what [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3607.28s)]
*  are we doing today? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3611.16s)]
*  Then they pad back up the stairs and get on their clothes and they go to work. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3612.7999999999997s)]
*  That's cool. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3617.2799999999997s)]
*  It's really nice. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3618.2799999999997s)]
*  It really is like what you always thought it would be in the old days. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3619.2799999999997s)]
*  What if we all lived in a dorm and we were just being funny all day? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3622.3199999999997s)]
*  Like that. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3625.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3626.92s)]
*  What was it like working on Kingpin? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3627.92s)]
*  Well those guys have more fun making movies than anyone. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3630.64s)]
*  They really make it fun. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3636.56s)]
*  I remember in between shots on Kingpin, we'd be on the side of a road somewhere, and it [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3639.24s)]
*  would be like everybody's got to pick up a rock, and we got thrown at that telephone [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3645.9199999999996s)]
*  pole. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3651.04s)]
*  Who's going to hit the telephone pole with a rock? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3652.04s)]
*  So we would sit there and like, I don't know, a dollar, $10, $100, whatever it was, we're [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3653.48s)]
*  throwing it, and somebody's got to hit the rock. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3659.08s)]
*  Then people pull out cash and pay. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3661.3199999999997s)]
*  Because it's just like, we just got to keep this thing going. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3663.8399999999997s)]
*  We're not going to let the energy of this thing drop. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3667.12s)]
*  Just fun. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3669.3199999999997s)]
*  Keep the fun rolling. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3670.3199999999997s)]
*  Just fun, yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3671.3199999999997s)]
*  Just creativity and always being loose and always being physical, always being connected, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3672.58s)]
*  attached, not just attached but connected, and entertaining. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3680.0s)]
*  Entertaining each other. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3686.2799999999997s)]
*  Really making this fun. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3687.66s)]
*  God damn it, we are going to have fun or else. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3688.96s)]
*  If you don't have fun making a comedy, you've just made a bad movie that's not funny. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3692.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3697.36s)]
*  Well, it comes off in the film. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3698.36s)]
*  The film is so fucking funny. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3699.96s)]
*  It's so good, and it's one of those films, like if you tried making that today, it would [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3702.1s)]
*  be an uphill trudge. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3705.44s)]
*  Well, you know, and that's like one of those things. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3708.12s)]
*  They had a moment on Saturday Night Live, an in-memoriam thing. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3712.14s)]
*  They said, oh, I was there the week of the thing, and they said, yeah, so-and-so's working [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3714.84s)]
*  on the in-memoriam, and I'm thinking, well, who's gone? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3719.38s)]
*  Which reminds me. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3722.2s)]
*  Who's gone? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3724.08s)]
*  And no, it's not who's passed away. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3725.08s)]
*  It's what we can't do anymore to be funny. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3729.12s)]
*  All these kinds of jokes. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3733.2799999999997s)]
*  And so it was just a whole clip. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3734.52s)]
*  I didn't even see it, but I saw a little bit of it being assembled, but it could be 40 [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3736.04s)]
*  minutes long. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3741.16s)]
*  Just all the sketches that you, people would, you would get internet responses like, we're [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3742.16s)]
*  going to burn down the city in New York. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3749.56s)]
*  It could be hours long today. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3750.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3752.64s)]
*  Hours long. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3753.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm short with 45. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3754.64s)]
*  But it's, but some of the funniest things ever done, you know, like head wound Harry, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3755.64s)]
*  you know, which was one that not many people think about. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3760.52s)]
*  But how, you know, like somebody would eject a dog eating a brain wound, you know, like [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3763.4s)]
*  licking, like the blood coming out of someone's skeletal wound, you know. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3768.52s)]
*  But someone told me on the way here, a friend of mine, a musician named Mike Zito, who said [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3773.26s)]
*  he listens to your show. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3780.4s)]
*  He said that you knew Phil Hartman. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3781.76s)]
*  Yeah, very well. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3783.8s)]
*  What did you do with Phil Hartman? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3784.84s)]
*  News radio was a sitcom we did together. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3786.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3788.1200000000003s)]
*  I didn't really watch much in news radio, but it was a 94 to 99. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3789.1200000000003s)]
*  I played the sort of like the maintenance guy in this radio station and Phil was the [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3792.88s)]
*  like the lead anchor. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3798.1200000000003s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3799.32s)]
*  Did you resent him because you were doing maintenance and he was the lead anchor? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3801.8s)]
*  No, so no, I'm just joking. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3804.92s)]
*  So and where was it? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3807.48s)]
*  Was it on CBS? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3808.96s)]
*  NBC? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3809.96s)]
*  NBC. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3810.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3811.96s)]
*  And so he was the news anchor. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3812.96s)]
*  Well, he's got that crazy voice. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3813.96s)]
*  He was great. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3815.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3816.76s)]
*  He was we became really good friends. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3817.76s)]
*  He was wonderful guy. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3819.2400000000002s)]
*  We actually played one of his clips the other day. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3821.52s)]
*  We had to take it out of the show, but it was a clip from SNL that you could never play [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3822.84s)]
*  today about a doctor who decided that every child was female and he had to do operations [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3826.16s)]
*  on all of them. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3831.2400000000002s)]
*  And we're like, holy shit. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3832.2400000000002s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3837.16s)]
*  And it's like, you know, 90 percent of his his births involved an operation that turned [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3840.04s)]
*  turned into a girl. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3844.56s)]
*  They were all girls. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3845.56s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3846.56s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3847.56s)]
*  But he was great. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3848.56s)]
*  Yeah, he was really good. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3849.7599999999998s)]
*  He was I worked with him. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3851.24s)]
*  I mean, I did set an alvegus when he was there, but he was in the movie we made called Quick [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3852.68s)]
*  Change and he was like sterling silver. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3856.44s)]
*  It was like every single take was just like perfect. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3862.92s)]
*  And it was so much fun. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3866.96s)]
*  And you just go, Phil, that was so great. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3869.0s)]
*  And you go like he was so kind of modestly proud of like, yeah, I felt pretty good about [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3870.56s)]
*  that. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3876.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's really nice. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3877.6s)]
*  He had real, real modesty. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3878.44s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3880.12s)]

*  So he was before he was an artist. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3885.24s)]
*  We have one of his albums out there in the the other room. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3887.4s)]
*  He was a musician. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3890.64s)]

*  He was a musician as well. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3893.44s)]
*  He did. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3894.64s)]
*  Why did I say musician? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3895.04s)]
*  But he did one of his albums. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3896.12s)]
*  I was I was looking at vinyl today. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3897.56s)]

*  I love to see that. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3909.12s)]
*  And then he was on Pee Wee's Playhouse. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=3912.84s)]

*  Like you'd make me feel like I wasn't doing enough. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4022.96s)]
*  Like he had have like all of his scripts would have tabs for all the scenes that he [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4025.48s)]
*  was in and they'd have notes underneath each thing and everything would be organized. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4029.04s)]
*  He had a three ring binder. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4033.2s)]
*  He would put the script in. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4034.52s)]
*  Well, that's going too far. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4035.64s)]
*  Who would hole punch the moment he got the script, put it in the three ring binder. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4036.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4040.36s)]
*  No, he was. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4041.16s)]
*  See, I didn't have that much face in the scripts. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4041.44s)]
*  I knew they were going to change a lot from Wednesday to Friday. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4043.12s)]
*  If it was a, if it was a big scene, I knew they would rewrite it the next two days. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4046.48s)]
*  Well, there was a lot. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4050.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't try it because it's hard to unlearn. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4051.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4053.68s)]
*  So I would not learn. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4054.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4056.04s)]
*  Cause if unlearning is really hard. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4056.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4058.84s)]
*  Like if you have a sketch that's this long and all of a sudden it's this long, you got [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4059.2s)]
*  problems. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4062.12s)]
*  Have you ever met Dave Foley? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4063.0s)]

*  Right. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4084.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4088.8s)]
*  I mean, there's, you know, I knew they were, I knew they were going to kill. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4089.08s)]
*  Cause I know how good my brother is as an improviser. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4093.2s)]
*  He can, you know, if you, if you get good at it and my brother is really good at it, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4096.24s)]
*  far better than I, I ever was or what could hope to be. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4099.88s)]
*  Cause he's really kept at it. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4104.84s)]
*  And so he really goes and goes hard at it. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4106.4s)]
*  He's really good at it. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4110.36s)]
*  I knew that they would kill. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4111.32s)]
*  I didn't realize how much fun the show would be from an audience perspective. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4112.44s)]
*  Like they drag a lot of people up on the stage and I think, well, that can go any [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4115.76s)]
*  old way at all. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4120.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4121.32s)]
*  And they managed to get, I mean, the show I saw, they had people in the audience [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4122.12s)]
*  that probably should have been hired. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4126.360000000001s)]
*  They were that funny. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4129.8s)]
*  That by the, there's something about the uncertainty of bringing up someone from [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4130.84s)]
*  the audience that raises the energy level and the expectation and the possibility. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4135.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4141.04s)]

*  And the, and the actors, the performers go crazy too. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4143.24s)]
*  Cause it's like, God damn, they just killed us. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4145.84s)]

*  So they're, they're, they're enjoying themselves. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4153.599999999999s)]
*  Well, it's a tight show. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4156.599999999999s)]
*  They've been doing that show for so long. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4157.719999999999s)]
*  Like their muscles are like very developed, you know, their comedy improvisation [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4159.4s)]
*  muscles, they're just so sharp. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4163.08s)]

*  world. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4446.0s)]
*  And he came up with this idea somehow to, to, if he could somehow get an interview [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4446.759999999999s)]
*  with Richard Nixon and it's a pretty well-made movie, it's very well-made movie [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4450.599999999999s)]
*  about it and they paint Frost pretty much as like maybe what he was like, sort of [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4457.5199999999995s)]
*  what the perception, my perception is kind of what he was like. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4464.36s)]
*  Not a perfect person, but, uh, certainly not, uh, you know, but certainly got some [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4467.96s)]
*  juice, certainly has some, some sort of idea of some, something going on. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4475.44s)]
*  I should, that sounds very small, but, uh, he, he was complicated. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4480.759999999999s)]
*  That's the cheating word and Nixon too. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4484.96s)]
*  And I just want to say that Frank Langella, who I only know from like doing, he kind of [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4488.5199999999995s)]
*  like a Broadway guy and he did some horror movies. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4493.88s)]
*  He's really good as Nixon. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4496.24s)]
*  Very, very, uh, very, uh, very good as Nixon. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4498.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's just a really well-made movie. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4501.88s)]
*  And I was, I was up in New York and I thought, you know, I'm going to find Frank [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4503.88s)]
*  Langella and tell him so there's the guy who I can't don't know what this man's [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4506.96s)]
*  name was who plays Frost. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4511.6s)]
*  I can't recall anything, but he's good. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4512.6s)]
*  And there's Langella playing Nixon and Langella is really good as Nixon. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4514.76s)]
*  And Nixon's not easy to do. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4519.2s)]
*  Does he do the voice well? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4521.24s)]
*  He does him well. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4522.88s)]
*  And you know, when you try too hard, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4523.88s)]
*  your personal lawyer came to Washington. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4527.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4529.12s)]
*  There you go. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4530.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4530.599999999999s)]
*  But you see it's good. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4530.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4532.5599999999995s)]
*  He's really good. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4532.799999999999s)]
*  So I never got around to finding out who, where Franklin Joe lived in New York or [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4533.5599999999995s)]
*  calling him up, but maybe someone who knows him listens to your show will say, Hey [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4538.36s)]
*  Frank, you got a shout out today in Texas. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4542.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4545.84s)]
*  That's great. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4546.08s)]
*  He was great as Dracula too. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4546.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4547.719999999999s)]
*  That whole Nixon Watergate story, I used to think about it very differently until [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4548.48s)]
*  Tucker Carlson broke it down for me. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4554.2s)]
*  Bob Woodward was an intelligence agent and the first time he ever gets a job as a [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4556.28s)]
*  journalist, he's covering Watergate. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4560.44s)]
*  The FBI, all the people that were involved in the break in FBI people, like it was, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4562.48s)]
*  it was a complete intelligence operation. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4567.08s)]
*  Nixon definitely did the things they accused him of, but the whole thing was sort [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4569.44s)]
*  of coordinated by the intelligence agents to get Nixon out of office. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4573.88s)]
*  Apparently what the story was, according to, I can play you the Tucker thing if [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4578.08s)]
*  you'd like to see it, but apparently what the story was, it sounds crazy. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4582.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, it sounds. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4586.6s)]
*  But the story was that Nixon was digging into who killed JFK. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4587.8s)]
*  One of the, one of the things that they wanted to set up when he was running for [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4594.6s)]
*  presidents to make sure that Gerald Ford was his vice president, Gerald Ford was [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4598.36s)]
*  also on the Warren commission that they were, he was digging into it and they [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4601.6s)]
*  wanted to remove him from office. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4605.8s)]
*  They set this up. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4607.599999999999s)]
*  They framed him. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4609.2s)]
*  He did it. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4610.16s)]
*  They got him out of office. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4611.32s)]
*  Gerald Ford gets in. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4612.959999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4614.12s)]
*  I got a shorter version. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4614.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4615.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4615.879999999999s)]
*  I don't, you're going to take me down to the Kennedy road and I, you know, where [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4616.12s)]
*  are we going there with that one? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4619.719999999999s)]
*  I got Richard Belzer tapes. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4620.879999999999s)]
*  I can play for you. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4622.12s)]
*  Oh, I'm a fan of Belzer. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4622.879999999999s)]
*  I've met Belzer. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4624.879999999999s)]
*  Belzer and I talked UFOs. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4626.759999999999s)]
*  The new guy is going to, the renew guy is going to bring out all the, all the [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4628.36s)]
*  Warren commission stuff, supposedly release all this stuff that was supposed to be. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4632.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4636.32s)]
*  But my question is what the fuck is going to be in there? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4636.8s)]
*  Calling. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4638.96s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4639.4400000000005s)]
*  I like that. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4640.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4640.72s)]
*  It's not going to be, Hey, this guy did it. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4640.88s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4642.92s)]
*  No, here's the way I see the Bob Woodward story. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4643.64s)]
*  See, you said, you said, I don't know. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4647.52s)]
*  What did you say first about Nixon? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4649.56s)]
*  You, about your way of looking at Nixon, the way I look at Nixon and part of it [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4650.88s)]
*  is seeing this, I like this way that I will love the way Langella did this. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4655.96s)]
*  I thought it was really well done. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4661.120000000001s)]
*  And, and, and it made a character of them, you know, written by a person of them. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4662.92s)]
*  Um, but to me, uh, I feel, here's what I feel about Nixon is like, you know, he [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4667.76s)]
*  was hard to care for it. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4678.2s)]
*  He ran against JFK who was everybody's, you know, my hero. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4679.2s)]
*  And my father actually pushed me into John F. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4682.04s)]
*  Kennedy at 1960, you know, just pushed me into the crowd and just pushed me up. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4684.72s)]
*  So I bounced up against him. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4689.96s)]
*  You know, now I, now it had been wrestled to the ground, but back then you could do [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4691.599999999999s)]
*  that anyway. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4695.32s)]
*  Uh, I, you know, I felt like Nixon was, you know, and certainly knowing [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4696.639999999999s)]
*  Hunter and knowing all of the history of Nixon and whatever, I, Nixon wasn't my guy. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4705.2s)]
*  Oh, agreed. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4710.04s)]
*  He was not my guy. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4710.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I'm not defending Nixon in any way, shape or form. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4711.32s)]
*  In fact, I talked about Nixon before that. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4713.28s)]
*  I think he's the problem with the whole psychedelics drug legalization act. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4715.12s)]
*  So, so, but however, when I read Wired, the book written by what's his name? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4720.280000000001s)]
*  Woodward about Belushi. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4726.08s)]
*  I read like five pages of Wired and I went, Oh my God, they frame Nixon. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4728.16s)]
*  All of a sudden I went, Oh my God, if this is what he writes about my friend that [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4738.0s)]
*  I've known, you know, for half of my adult life, which is completely inaccurate [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4741.52s)]
*  talking to like the people of the outer, outer circle, getting the story. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4747.48s)]
*  What the hell did that? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4752.2s)]
*  Could they have done to Nixon? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4753.16s)]
*  I just felt like if he did this to my friend like this, and I acknowledge [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4755.48s)]
*  I only read five pages, but the five pages I read, you know, maybe one, I [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4762.16s)]
*  like set fire to the whole thing. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4765.879999999999s)]
*  Jamie, see if you can find it. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4767.5599999999995s)]
*  Those five pages I went, if they, if he did this to Belushi, what he did in [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4768.08s)]
*  Nixon's is probably soiled for me too. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4772.639999999999s)]
*  I can't, I can't take it. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4776.04s)]
*  And I know you say, well, you could have two sources and everything like that. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4778.16s)]
*  But the two sources that he had, if he had them for the Wired book were so far [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4781.48s)]
*  outside the inner circle that it was, it was criminal, cruel. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4786.16s)]
*  And the reasoning for it is that the most famous person ever to come from [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4790.96s)]
*  Wheaton, Illinois is John Belushi. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4796.72s)]
*  The second most famous person to come from Wheaton, Illinois is Harold [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4799.879999999999s)]
*  Red Grange, the football player. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4806.04s)]
*  And the third most famous person to come from Wheaton, Illinois is Bob Woodward. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4809.32s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4816.759999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4820.599999999999s)]
*  So there's all my controversy for today. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4821.759999999999s)]

*  He broke into New York. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4858.64s)]

*  know, to New York. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4865.68s)]
*  He's the one that got everyone there. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4866.92s)]
*  And there are musicians and lots of them that will thank Belushi for the [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4869.08s)]
*  creation of, you know, the revivification of the blues and for like the fact [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4873.64s)]
*  that there's like a house of blues chain that blues players can go and play [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4879.32s)]
*  and there are all these venues that wouldn't have existed without Belushi. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4884.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4887.84s)]

*  He did a lot of, there's a lot of people that slept on John Belushi's couch. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4890.4800000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of people that stayed for free at his house until they made it in [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4894.360000000001s)]
*  New York and I'm one and, and any, and any, you know, you know, he died in an [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4898.360000000001s)]
*  unfortunate way, but the man, when he was, he was the, still the best stage [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4904.08s)]
*  actor I ever saw. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4909.72s)]
*  He was absolutely magnetic. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4911.68s)]
*  You couldn't take your eyes off him. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4913.24s)]
*  And he did a lot of wonderful things for each other. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4915.24s)]
*  He was a short hitter guy could only drink like four beers and he was drunk. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4917.2s)]
*  So the idea that he died of an overdose is hilarious. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4920.84s)]
*  Like that's what my brother said. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4923.36s)]
*  He said, what do you have four beers? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4924.48s)]
*  You know, he's John's dad. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4926.0s)]
*  What do you have four beers? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4927.48s)]
*  Cause he was not really much of a drinker, but. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4928.599999999999s)]

*  It was a speed ball. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4934.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4935.12s)]

*  What was his version? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4947.4s)]
*  Oh, it was just, he was just, he was talking to people like, wait a minute. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4948.5199999999995s)]

*  the center of things is telling you the facts about John Belushi, that guy way [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4955.88s)]

*  And he didn't contact any of you guys? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4965.08s)]
*  Well, I didn't, I didn't want to have anything to do with it. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4966.719999999999s)]

*  going and it wasn't exactly where I thought it was going. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4981.96s)]
*  I, it was even worse than where I thought it was going. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4985.92s)]
*  It was just the title alone. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4988.599999999999s)]
*  You know, it was just, it was cold. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4990.28s)]
*  So it was just exploitation of his death. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4993.36s)]
*  You know, I, I, you would have to hold me down and burn my feet to make me read [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=4996.68s)]
*  more of it so I couldn't say that it's exploitation of his death, but you know, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5002.320000000001s)]

*  in the five I read and maybe, maybe I was unlucky, but if that much was, to me was [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5036.799999999999s)]
*  disturbingly ugly and like irresponsible to report. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5047.12s)]
*  And then I can't imagine that I got so that I only found by, you know, and I'm [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5052.16s)]

*  as well, you know, so there's no other venues for people to express themselves. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5079.68s)]
*  Back then it was like, he writes the book, he does the interviews for the book. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5085.36s)]
*  This is the narrative. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5088.88s)]

*  Um, there was a lot more freedom. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5114.28s)]
*  Uh, and it was, when I got there, you know, the town was broke, you know, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5118.08s)]

*  subways were rough and, you know, people, you know, to me, it was exciting. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5127.68s)]
*  I didn't, what the hell I know. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5133.08s)]

*  You know, there was some more hazard and where I lived in Chicago was more [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5145.64s)]
*  dangerous than where I lived in, in, in New York ever, but, but the city was, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5149.28s)]
*  you know, the, the economic part of it and the infrastructure was, you know, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5154.68s)]
*  like the subways were, you know, people complain about the subways now. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5159.24s)]

*  These subways are air conditioned and the windows close those windows. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5165.08s)]
*  Those windows were open summer and winter, and you either froze or you had [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5168.96s)]
*  like metal shavings dust flying through in the summer with no heat, with no [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5174.719999999999s)]

*  Sort of, I don't know why there's tambourines and stuff on it. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5602.08s)]
*  I have no idea, but there's always a glass of beer for some reason. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5605.12s)]
*  There's a drum. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5608.4800000000005s)]
*  But there's a bunch of references to people we know and things we did [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5609.68s)]
*  in Chicago and I see there's like the names of some character in the movie I [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5613.6s)]
*  played and then there's Slew's place. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5618.280000000001s)]

*  Way to go high for that one. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5635.88s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5637.0s)]
*  When you stomp Tony Hinchcliffe in this inevitable match, you'll wear that. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5637.72s)]
*  Be perfect. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5642.280000000001s)]
*  There's that. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5643.2s)]
*  How long you been golfing for? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5644.92s)]
*  Well, the question is how long was I haven't been caddying for. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5646.88s)]
*  So I started caddying when I was very young. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5650.16s)]
*  My, our eldest brother Edwards started caddying. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5654.4800000000005s)]
*  So Caddyshack must've been a lot of fun for you then. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5657.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5660.16s)]
*  Well, Caddyshack came, you know, my brother Brian was the, wrote the, Brian [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5660.44s)]
*  wrote it with Doug Kenny, one of the really great funny guys from National [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5667.0s)]
*  Ampoon and Harold Ramis who ended up directing the movie. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5670.5199999999995s)]
*  But all the golf stuff is all Brian's, you know, memories of caddying. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5673.5599999999995s)]
*  And the whole golf story comes from Brian, sort of. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5678.599999999999s)]
*  The joke, I mean, they all write jokes, but Doug was in charge of all the [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5681.2s)]
*  fancy lad stuff, his dad was some sort of tennis pro, sometime brother in Ohio. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5685.639999999999s)]
*  And Harold wrote the jokes that were left and shaped it and directed it. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5691.4s)]
*  So you started off caddying. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5696.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5698.719999999999s)]
*  I started as a shag boy, which doesn't even exist anymore. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5699.2s)]
*  What is that? [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5701.8s)]
*  There's a thing called a jam boy, which I don't know if it really exists. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5702.2s)]
*  My friend Duff insists that back in the day, there was a thing called a [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5705.44s)]
*  jam boy who walked around, I think it was a slave or something like it, who [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5710.32s)]
*  walked around covered with jam to draw the insects away from the golfers. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5716.0s)]
*  Now, I don't know if that's true or not. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5719.92s)]
*  We should ask your listeners. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5721.08s)]
*  But I was, I was, I didn't have it that bad, of course, but, um, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5723.84s)]
*  a shag boy was, golfers had what they call a shag bag, which was like a small [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5727.28s)]
*  bag of golf balls, like a hundred golf balls or something like that. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5732.16s)]
*  And they would dump them out on the practice tee and you would run out there [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5735.5199999999995s)]
*  with the bag and they would, you would be the target. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5738.639999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5742.84s)]
*  Go out about 70 yards, 60 yards, you know, and then they'd start hitting. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5743.16s)]
*  See? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5747.04s)]
*  No, but see that would be safer than what I was wearing. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5747.96s)]
*  We didn't have that, but I was just out there. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5750.96s)]
*  See, can you, yeah. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5753.84s)]
*  But I was definitely out there and they would aim at you. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5755.36s)]
*  And the thing was it would last for an hour or so. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5758.16s)]
*  And you know, you're only, I was 10 when I started doing this. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5761.04s)]
*  So, um, you sort of, your mind would wander and occasionally you'd hear [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5764.5599999999995s)]
*  like a ball land next to you or really close. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5769.0s)]
*  I never got conked exactly on the head, but I definitely got hit on one [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5771.84s)]
*  bounce on any number of times, but, um, you were just the target. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5775.719999999999s)]
*  And then you, they, he wavin the next club and you go like seven aren't. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5780.24s)]
*  So you'd have to back up a little farther and then farther. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5783.28s)]
*  And the bigger the club, the wider the dispersion of the, of the ball. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5785.36s)]
*  So you had to run back. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5789.88s)]
*  You really had to run to catch up to where this bad golfer was hitting the golf [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5790.92s)]
*  balls. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5795.96s)]
*  So that's what that was when I was 10. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5796.719999999999s)]
*  And then like a year or so later, I became like a caddy and then I [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5798.04s)]
*  caddied all the way through high school, paid my way through high school. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5801.5199999999995s)]
*  When did you start playing? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5804.84s)]
*  Well, if you, if you showed up to caddy on Sunday, you were allowed to play [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5806.88s)]
*  golf on Monday morning. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5810.48s)]
*  So probably I didn't really play golf golf like that until really 12, maybe, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5811.12s)]
*  um, maybe a little sooner or later, but we used to play golf across the street [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5817.599999999999s)]
*  from our house. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5822.0s)]
*  There were phone, it was like a, a line of telephone poles planted in grass, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5822.639999999999s)]
*  you know, and we would play from phone pole to phone pole. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5828.16s)]
*  And that was the, that was the pin. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5831.48s)]
*  So, but, so that's it. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5834.759999999999s)]
*  And then I did a little bit of golf, but I didn't play golf. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5836.5199999999995s)]
*  But so that's it. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5839.04s)]
*  And then I didn't really play. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5840.0s)]
*  I mean, once I sort of, you know, made it through high school and didn't play for [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5841.36s)]
*  a long time until I made some money. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5845.68s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you can play golf again, cause golf, if you're not [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5848.44s)]
*  caddying, it takes money to play. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5852.08s)]
*  You got to at least play and be organized and have a set of clubs and stuff. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5853.84s)]
*  So I, um, I picked it up then and, uh, and now I like it, you know, I was going to [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5857.56s)]
*  give it up a few years ago, but then, you know, all of a sudden my son started [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5864.44s)]
*  playing golf and was like, well, that's what you got to do, you know? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5868.8s)]
*  I, so now I'm having more fun playing and I've gotten smarter. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5872.04s)]
*  Do you ever play golf? [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5877.2s)]
*  No, never, no, never. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5878.04s)]
*  No, I'm scared of it. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5881.6s)]
*  Cause I think it'll eat up all my time because I get addicted to games. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5883.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5887.76s)]
*  I play pool a lot. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5888.84s)]
*  Do you have a pool table here? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5891.16s)]
*  I got a couple of pool tables here. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5892.28s)]
*  I got one at home. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5894.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5895.16s)]
*  And what games do you play? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5896.400000000001s)]
*  Do you play like straight pool? [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5897.4400000000005s)]
*  Nine ball, 10 ball. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5898.88s)]

*  The thing about it is I know everybody who plays golf gets fully [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5906.72s)]
*  addicted to it and loves it to death. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5909.200000000001s)]
*  And I just don't have the time to get fully addicted to another thing. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5910.76s)]
*  And, you know, just being friends with Jamie and seeing Jamie's addiction. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5914.160000000001s)]
*  See what's happened over the last few years. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5917.84s)]
*  He's become a maniac. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5919.52s)]
*  He's got a golfing simulator in the back and really drives balls and, oh yeah. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5920.6s)]
*  A track man. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5925.56s)]
*  A track man. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5926.200000000001s)]
*  It's in here. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5927.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5928.400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5929.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5929.68s)]
*  He has it set up in the garage and whenever I come here, he drives balls. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5929.88s)]
*  Do you guys live in this building? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5934.04s)]
*  No, we don't. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5935.0s)]
*  It's a big building, but we don't live here. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5935.88s)]
*  We could. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5937.92s)]
*  We definitely could. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5938.6s)]
*  Maybe that's the next one. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5939.96s)]
*  Maybe the next one will set up dorms. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5940.92s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5942.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5943.080000000001s)]
*  There's always the rooftop. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5943.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5945.360000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, I guess I'm okay. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5946.76s)]
*  Well, I don't want you to get addicted. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5949.240000000001s)]
*  Well, I just, I've heard you're a very good golfer. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5950.8s)]
*  That's why I'm asking. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5952.8s)]
*  Well, just keep that light going. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5953.4800000000005s)]
*  But it's, but I can play okay. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5955.36s)]
*  You know, I've played, I've hit a lot of golf shots. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5958.32s)]
*  What's like your handicap? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5960.08s)]
*  Jamie will know what that means. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5961.2s)]
*  No, it's, now it's about 12. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5962.2s)]
*  The lowest I ever was, was about seven. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5963.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5966.44s)]
*  It means I can play a little bit. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5967.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5968.32s)]
*  And now it's actually, it's, what's the word diminishing? [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5968.48s)]
*  It's going lower. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5972.04s)]
*  Cause I've, I've figured something out. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5973.64s)]
*  There's a, I went to, there's a great book. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5975.32s)]
*  These ladies, I got Pia Nielsen and Lynn. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5977.88s)]
*  Pia Nielsen is an easy one to remember, but Lynn's, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5985.5599999999995s)]
*  what's whatever Lynn's last time. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5987.96s)]
*  They wrote a great book called Every Shot Must Have a Purpose. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5989.12s)]
*  Do you ever read that one? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5991.6s)]
*  Well, I should talk about them because they're, they're, they really are onto [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5993.44s)]
*  something and it's about quieting your brain when you play, which I always [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=5996.88s)]
*  thought I'd get better when my, as my brain softened, it seemed to be happening. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6001.5599999999995s)]
*  My brain was softening. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6005.96s)]
*  It was maybe getting better, but not fast enough for me. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6006.96s)]
*  And then I got started following what these ladies had to write. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6010.16s)]
*  They were Annika's teachers at one time and Annika Sorenstam. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6014.120000000001s)]
*  She's a famous golfer. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6017.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6019.080000000001s)]
*  Swedish. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6019.4400000000005s)]
*  Every Shot Must Have a Purpose. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6020.120000000001s)]
*  And there's the forward by Annika. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6021.76s)]
*  Anyway, Lynn Marriott. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6023.72s)]
*  How can see I'm blocking that cause it's a hotel name. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6024.84s)]
*  But I, and I, and I, I didn't used to be a member of the Marriott club, but okay. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6028.8s)]
*  So that's a great book and they've written a bunch of stuff that they, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6034.120000000001s)]
*  they're, they know some stuff. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6037.56s)]
*  So what is that one, Jamie? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6038.76s)]
*  What does it change? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6040.0s)]
*  It made me enjoy. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6041.5599999999995s)]
*  I enjoy golf. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6042.76s)]
*  I've always had a lot of fun, but that made me enjoy golf even more. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6043.5199999999995s)]
*  How so? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6047.44s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6048.0s)]
*  You know, it just, it's decluttering, you know, it's like when you do it in your [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6049.0s)]
*  life and you, um, you know, you talk about, you know, you mentioned distractions [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6053.32s)]
*  at the very beginning, you know, you think about all the things that can [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6060.5199999999995s)]
*  catch you, you know, to distract you. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6063.6s)]
*  And if you're trying to do something that's pretty straightforward, whether [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6071.44s)]
*  it's, um, stir grits or, uh, sew a line of something or, or play a game of [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6078.24s)]
*  golf, which ideally you only have to swing, hit the ball like 75 times. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6089.32s)]
*  If you're, you know, if you, everything that distracts you from that is a, is, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6094.48s)]
*  is a problem. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6100.52s)]
*  So it's the ability to like sort of just pull the weeds out of your head. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6101.28s)]
*  As I read a Japanese man say once and, and, and attend to it when you attend to [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6105.28s)]
*  it, it's, you know, it's a few hours to play a run of golf. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6112.72s)]
*  Like you say, it takes a little time, but the actual playing of the game is only. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6115.56s)]
*  Minutes the actual hitting of the ball is only minutes. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6120.24s)]
*  Like an NFL game can take like three hours on TV, but it's like 20 minutes of [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6123.64s)]
*  action, right? [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6129.36s)]
*  So it's similar to that in golf that or anything that you have to sort of [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6131.08s)]
*  return to yourself to hit the ball. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6138.839999999999s)]
*  You got to come back, get it back together to hit the ball or do anything. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6140.92s)]
*  And so you set your, you have the freedom in between the shots to move and to speak [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6147.4s)]
*  and tell jokes and smoke cigars and what not you want to do, but when you want to [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6153.679999999999s)]
*  hit the ball, this is about you got to, you're going to think, make a little plan [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6158.36s)]
*  and you separate that you sort of inculcate that you take it in and then you [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6163.16s)]
*  separate that and you step up and you hit the, hit the thing and hitting the thing [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6170.04s)]
*  is only hitting the thing and that if you can do that, then you start having real [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6173.2s)]
*  success with the actual hitting and the sort of joy of the sort of mind body [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6179.719999999999s)]
*  connection and all this sort of aesthetic, all the kind of like, you know, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6185.96s)]
*  almost spiritual things about a mind, body exercise, a game come to you, you know, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6192.52s)]
*  like, you know, when you're a great athlete, say they're in a zone, they're not in a [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6198.32s)]
*  zone. They're really conscious. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6202.76s)]
*  They're really connected. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6205.28s)]
*  They're really aware. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6206.32s)]
*  It is, it's more than a zone. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6207.72s)]
*  It's, it's like the ideal place to be. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6209.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6212.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6213.68s)]
*  And what is it about their writing that helped you? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6214.44s)]
*  Like, what is their philosophy that helped like steer you more towards being able to [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6217.24s)]
*  do that? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6221.76s)]
*  Well, for an example, it's like something that can keep you in your body because you [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6222.4s)]
*  have to stay in your body. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6227.12s)]
*  I believe that anyway. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6228.68s)]
*  I'd already believed that. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6230.12s)]
*  But I'd say, so you've got this dreidel here, right? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6231.08s)]
*  So imagine it's a golf ball. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6233.8s)]
*  One thing that they sort of say was like you would, you would just in between shots, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6235.16s)]
*  you would just take your golf ball if you're on a putting green or if you have a spare [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6241.12s)]
*  in your pocket and you just. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6244.4s)]
*  Toss it up and catch it, toss it up and catch it. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6248.4s)]
*  That keeps. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6251.6s)]
*  Keeps you like physically aware of I've got to do this and this and that. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6254.44s)]
*  I've got to do these two things, so I've got to have my attention in my body. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6260.92s)]
*  I've got to stay home, you know. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6264.96s)]
*  So if you can stay in your body, it all begins in the body, everything we are, everything [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6267.52s)]
*  we hope to be, everything we dream about, it's all within the skin. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6272.4800000000005s)]
*  So you've got to stay within the skin. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6276.8s)]
*  So if you can make yourself come back, if you can get yourself back inside. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6279.040000000001s)]
*  You don't have so far to go to achieve your intended goal. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6285.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6290.6s)]
*  You don't have to, you don't have to like drag yourself back from outer space. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6291.040000000001s)]
*  You're not dreaming over there. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6294.52s)]
*  I'm in my body already, so I'm close. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6296.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, does that make sense? [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6299.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6299.92s)]
*  So and. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6301.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, I've had some discussions with Pia and she says, well, that's what the [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6303.52s)]
*  great golfers are doing. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6307.320000000001s)]
*  They are pulling themselves back into this thing. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6308.64s)]
*  That's why they hit so many good shots is because they. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6311.92s)]
*  They're home, you know, they're home. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6316.64s)]
*  You know, and so that's that's sort of what I got out of her. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6319.0s)]
*  And I, I sort of learn and believe that from other venues, but I never had it put [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6322.24s)]
*  in with practical applications like, like she gives, they give for golf. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6328.679999999999s)]
*  You know, you think of golf is like, oh, I can be Willy nilly out here. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6335.4s)]
*  I can be fun or I can be aggressive or I can be competitive or whatever the hell. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6338.76s)]
*  All that stuff is real. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6343.04s)]
*  That's emotion kind of thing. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6345.92s)]
*  But if you're not in the body, good luck. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6347.679999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6351.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, and it's only luck. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6351.96s)]
*  Well, there's, there's a great joy in things that take you away from the rest of the world [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6353.84s)]
*  because they require so much of your attention. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6359.12s)]
*  That's what I get out of pool. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6361.56s)]
*  And that's what I get out of archery too. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6363.16s)]
*  I practice archery, but there's things that require so much focus while you're doing [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6364.84s)]
*  them and you have to be in your body. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6370.36s)]
*  You have to, you have to be synchronized. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6372.12s)]
*  I would imagine archery would be one of the more challenging, very challenging. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6375.08s)]
*  It's very challenging because it's you have, you're supposed to have as little movement as [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6379.0s)]
*  possible upon the execution of the shot. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6384.12s)]
*  And so there's all these strategies. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6386.4800000000005s)]
*  They started televising it lately. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6388.400000000001s)]
*  It's really cool to watch. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6389.84s)]
*  Oh, it's very cool to watch. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6391.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6392.52s)]
*  And they've got them cameras are right on their face and just the torso, just like this. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6392.84s)]
*  And you're like, God dang, that's beautiful. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6397.240000000001s)]
*  That's as good a close up as any Robin Hood movie ever had. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6399.68s)]
*  It's just great. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6402.84s)]
*  No, I love watching it. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6404.04s)]
*  I watch it on YouTube all the time. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6405.400000000001s)]
*  There's these Las Vegas shootouts where they have three targets and they have 30 different [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6406.88s)]
*  shots. So they have they're trying to get an X 30 different times and they're standing next to [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6413.32s)]
*  the best archers in the world. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6419.28s)]
*  Everyone's at probably like 20 meters and they're all just focusing like dead still, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6421.24s)]
*  completely calm, focusing, focusing. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6427.16s)]
*  What's that? Where do you find that? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6429.56s)]
*  Oh, you can find it. Like go to Lancaster archery, Vegas. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6431.52s)]
*  And they have what they call a Vegas face. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6437.84s)]
*  So a Vegas face is three targets. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6440.84s)]
*  Do people watch that live? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6442.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6443.2s)]
*  But they've got to have like big screens because you can't see the faces from a distance, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6444.12s)]
*  right? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6448.12s)]
*  No. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6448.360000000001s)]
*  You don't want to get between the arrows, of course. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6448.76s)]
*  No, you definitely don't. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6450.28s)]
*  People bring binoculars. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6451.24s)]
*  All the archers have binoculars and they'll pull them up after each shot because they're [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6452.64s)]
*  looking for precise distances and then they'll make slight adjustments on their scope and [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6457.4400000000005s)]
*  their sight and move and then they'll take a breath. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6462.68s)]
*  But it's just do you have one of those Massivo? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6465.96s)]
*  Yes, this is exactly what it's like. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6468.8s)]
*  Those things don't even look fair. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6470.4400000000005s)]
*  So these guys are all on this line and they're all firing. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6471.92s)]
*  And the amount of pressure is insane because really the guy who makes money out of this [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6476.12s)]
*  thing is the guy who wins first place. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6480.88s)]
*  Everything else is not so good. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6482.64s)]
*  It's not a lot of money in archery. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6484.64s)]
*  Look at the audience. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6486.320000000001s)]
*  It's like about 60 guys. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6487.12s)]
*  Yeah, not a lot of audience, right? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6488.12s)]
*  It's not a crowd pleaser. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6489.72s)]
*  So this is just for real complete archery fanatics who are absolutely lost in this connection [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6490.64s)]
*  between your mind, your body and the flight of the arrow, the mystical flight of the arrow. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6498.4800000000005s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6504.04s)]
*  Can you go back and freeze that there? [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6504.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6507.4800000000005s)]
*  Can you lose the line on the bottom? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6507.88s)]
*  So that's just interesting to me to look at. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6510.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6513.08s)]
*  Like their weight balance, just to look at like who's on his sort of half his front foot. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6513.52s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6520.0s)]
*  They have a little bit more weight on their back foot. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6520.84s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6522.8s)]
*  Well, we're catching this in mid draw. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6523.36s)]
*  So he might settle. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6526.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6527.68s)]
*  See that guy that you were looking at who was like that. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6527.88s)]
*  That's got brazier on his back. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6530.36s)]
*  Watch. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6531.6s)]
*  He'll settle. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6532.16s)]
*  So he'll draw and as he draws, he arches back and now watch, he'll settle forward. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6533.08s)]
*  So he's settled. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6538.0s)]
*  He was settling as the angle changed of the camera shot, but they want to ideally be about [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6538.64s)]
*  50, 50 and you're just staying calm, keeping it as steady as possible. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6544.12s)]
*  And the wheelchair shooting too. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6550.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6551.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6552.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a guy that shoots with just his feet, the guy who doesn't have arms and he's [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6553.08s)]
*  unbelievably accurate. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6558.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6560.08s)]
*  He shoots with his toes. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6560.28s)]
*  So what these guys are doing is it's just a perfect balance of technique and focus and [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6562.04s)]
*  attention and they're actually trying to get what's called a surprise shot. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6569.56s)]
*  They're not executing the shot like you would like a rifle trigger. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6574.68s)]
*  Most of these guys use what's called a hinge. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6579.080000000001s)]
*  And so that's what they're going for. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6582.080000000001s)]
*  They're looking for it. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6583.240000000001s)]
*  So with a hinge, you don't, you don't make the hinge, you don't make the release go off [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6583.92s)]
*  like with a button where you press a button. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6590.280000000001s)]
*  It's just a rotation of the handle and you don't know when it's going to go off. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6592.52s)]
*  So you draw it back. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6597.120000000001s)]
*  You're not like letting go with your fingers. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6598.24s)]
*  No, no. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6600.2s)]
*  You have a metal release in your hand that has a hook and the hook is attached to a sear. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6601.4s)]
*  By just twerking your wrist, rotating it, it breaks. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6607.36s)]
*  And so the hook breaks. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6611.32s)]
*  And so see the, or some of them use a thumb like that guy with the yellow and black, that [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6613.12s)]
*  guy. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6619.04s)]
*  So he's got a thumb trigger. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6619.48s)]
*  So what he's doing is he's setting the trigger, the barrel, the trigger right where his [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6620.76s)]
*  thumb is. And he's just using the pulling of his arm to make it go off. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6625.56s)]
*  He's not executing it with his thumb. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6629.76s)]
*  Now there's a small, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6631.84s)]
*  So that's why they all look different when they're on the release. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6633.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6635.92s)]
*  But they all, their arms all fly backwards. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6636.84s)]
*  If you watch, see how their arm moves backwards, that's indicative of a surprise shot. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6641.200000000001s)]
*  That means they're executing it perfectly. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6645.84s)]
*  So as they're pulling back, they don't know when it's going to go. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6648.040000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6650.6s)]
*  They're just executing the technique, which is the pull with the back muscles. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6651.44s)]
*  You're pulling with your rhomboids and then it slowly goes off. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6655.5599999999995s)]
*  See that guy with the hat, the black hat. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6659.36s)]
*  Watch, see his fingers, how it's curling. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6661.639999999999s)]
*  See how it goes off. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6663.48s)]
*  So that's just from his hand curling that's making the shot go off. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6664.599999999999s)]
*  But they get it to the position or the area where it's going to go. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6668.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6672.639999999999s)]
*  And they've got to be right. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6673.36s)]
*  They've got to be poised forward. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6674.48s)]
*  But the idea is if you think about it going off and you make it go off, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6677.2s)]
*  there's some sort of a recoil. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6682.599999999999s)]
*  So there's some sort of an anticipation of that recoil. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6684.68s)]
*  And when you're shooting that precisely, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6687.44s)]
*  that anticipation of that recoil might make a difference of an inch or two left or right. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6689.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, that tension. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6693.68s)]
*  So you try to not anticipate, so it really does surprise you. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6694.88s)]
*  When you are doing that, you do not think about anything else. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6698.5199999999995s)]
*  It clears your mind. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6704.12s)]
*  When you are just concentrating on that target, you cannot think about your build. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6706.12s)]
*  And so you do it. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6711.400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6712.400000000001s)]
*  And when you when a thought does come into your head, you don't hit the target. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6712.84s)]
*  Yes, but it doesn't come in your head. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6716.4400000000005s)]
*  It can't. It's too hard. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6718.2s)]
*  The process of aiming is so engrossing when you lock in place and you're aiming [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6720.400000000001s)]
*  and then you're pulling back with the shot like you're all in. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6727.6s)]
*  You're all there, especially if you're good. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6731.320000000001s)]
*  If you're good, that is the only thing you're thinking of. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6734.12s)]
*  And there's a moving meditation aspect to it, a cleansing of your mind. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6737.0s)]
*  Your worries go away. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6742.28s)]
*  Your thoughts, the things that are bugging you and I got to do this and I got to call that guy back. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6744.12s)]
*  And all that goes away because it's so engrossing. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6748.96s)]
*  It requires so much. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6752.68s)]
*  So how do you affect that yourself? [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6753.92s)]
*  How do you how do you move that away from the. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6755.88s)]
*  Incidental thoughts that pop in. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6760.8s)]
*  Well, it's just the difficulty of it. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6762.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's the difficulty of it actually sort of facilitates your meditative mindset [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6765.92s)]
*  because if you're going to do it right, there's no other way to do it. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6772.400000000001s)]
*  You literally can't be thinking about other things while you're doing it. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6775.08s)]
*  Well, it's it's not unlike golf. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6778.4800000000005s)]
*  Like if you're thinking about what you got to pick up on the way home. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6780.56s)]
*  Exactly. You're not going to go. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6783.52s)]
*  Same as pool. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6784.88s)]
*  When I play pool at a pretty high level, like I bet that book would be very beneficial to me. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6786.24s)]
*  I bet there's some techniques and strategies of how to focus yourself [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6791.64s)]
*  and completely remove yourself from the rest of the world and just think about this [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6796.200000000001s)]
*  mind, body connection and this the execution of this thing that you're trying to do. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6800.04s)]
*  All right, I'm going to try to do that. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6807.08s)]
*  I know I I I, you know, I don't play enough pool. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6810.360000000001s)]
*  And but I did. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6815.04s)]
*  I had to I had to shoot some pool in Groundhog Day. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6816.52s)]
*  So I got with like a guy who's a pool expert and he just gave me drills to do. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6819.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you remember his name? No. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6824.2s)]
*  But if he remembers, he should say hi. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6826.12s)]
*  Anyway, he taught me a bunch of things. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6828.16s)]
*  And I was very I'm still very disappointed because when we actually shot the scene, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6830.44s)]
*  I think I made I think I sank. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6835.08s)]
*  I think I shot I think I think like nine balls and seven balls, eight balls [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6839.84s)]
*  in three shots. And I went. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6844.08s)]
*  We got that and the and the and the center of tower was like. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6846.04s)]
*  Well, let's let's set it up. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6850.96s)]
*  I'll set up a different. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6852.4s)]
*  I said, what are you talking about? [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6853.84s)]
*  He had half of the table. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6855.04s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6857.96s)]
*  All right. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6861.64s)]
*  I didn't take a leak. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6862.28s)]
*  OK, you want to wrap it up? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6862.96s)]
*  We can wrap it up. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6864.16s)]
*  No, that's OK. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6864.96s)]
*  OK, all right. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6865.6s)]
*  Take a leak and come back. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6866.44s)]
*  All right. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6867.44s)]
*  I keep asking him any suggestions. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6868.92s)]
*  They say, well, tell some stories. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6870.44s)]
*  OK. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6872.12s)]
*  You should never ask me that. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6873.6s)]
*  You should never ask. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6875.24s)]
*  So where do you come from? [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6876.72s)]
*  I was born in New Jersey, went to high school in Boston, lived all over the country, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6878.4400000000005s)]
*  lived in San Francisco for a while when I was a kid. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6882.92s)]
*  Florida. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6886.0s)]
*  Were you military or something? [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6887.2s)]
*  No. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6888.24s)]
*  Mother got divorced, married my stepfather. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6889.84s)]
*  He was going to school, went to San Francisco for that and then Florida. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6892.6s)]
*  And then eventually Boston. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6897.96s)]
*  Well, that's pretty good. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6900.64s)]
*  I mean, I think I always want to live in San Francisco. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6901.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, I was in San Francisco during the Vietnam War and the height of the hippie [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6904.36s)]
*  days when I was a little kid. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6907.599999999999s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6908.8s)]
*  It was a very interesting time to be there. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6910.599999999999s)]
*  You know, it was a crazy place. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6913.12s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's what I was talking about. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6915.72s)]
*  I think, yeah, my brother was there, too. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6917.4s)]
*  He went to school out there at St. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6919.96s)]
*  Mary's in Morocco. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6921.24s)]
*  OK. And so but it turned out he was spending a lot of time in Berkeley. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6922.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he wasn't doing that much studying. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6926.32s)]
*  But he but what a life he had out there. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6929.32s)]
*  What a fantastic time to have been there. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6932.2s)]
*  And my other friend went to high school at that time somewhere around there. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6934.48s)]
*  And I envied that. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6938.32s)]
*  And I I I really like San Francisco. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6940.28s)]
*  And I I was there recently. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6943.08s)]
*  I saw Dr. Not Dr. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6946.48s)]
*  Father Guido Sarducci. Oh, wow. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6948.88s)]
*  And had had had dinner with he and with him and Roman Coppola. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6951.72s)]
*  And we went to an old place called Macaroni or something like that. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6957.16s)]
*  Old Italian place. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6961.64s)]
*  And it was really delightful. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6962.6s)]
*  What a I just love San Francisco. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6964.72s)]
*  And I have friends who were like [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6967.0s)]
*  and we started talking about politics a long time ago, like for political reasons, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6970.120000000001s)]
*  they all have San Francisco, they've ruined San Francisco. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6973.96s)]
*  I said, well, and so I was there. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6975.92s)]
*  And I know there's homeless people in San Francisco now, lots of them. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6978.08s)]
*  And they're and there's homeless people in Los Angeles and Santa Monica [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6981.96s)]
*  and anywhere that is warm. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6985.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Especially in California is the most popular state. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6987.04s)]
*  But I don't think it's a I don't think it's a political choice. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6989.88s)]
*  I mean, I think isn't it? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6993.88s)]
*  I don't know the stats, but these people don't. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=6995.92s)]
*  It's more of a mental health thing. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7000.4400000000005s)]
*  It's definitely a mental issue. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7002.04s)]
*  It's not anybody's politics that are making people crazy. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7003.68s)]
*  And well, it's but it's not making people live on the street. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7006.4800000000005s)]
*  But I know I just I'm sticking up for San Francisco saying it's still [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7009.68s)]

*  It survived the hippies. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7017.84s)]
*  It survived the earthquake. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7019.28s)]
*  It survived AIDS. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7021.32s)]
*  It survived everything. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7022.88s)]
*  It's like a resilient, extraordinary place. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7024.84s)]
*  You know, it's still got a lot of extraordinary aspects to it. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7027.88s)]
*  The problem is they kind of encourage people to sleep on the streets [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7030.92s)]
*  and shit anywhere they want. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7034.719999999999s)]
*  And they didn't do anything about it. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7036.12s)]
*  And it just really think they encourage people. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7037.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, they definitely make it financially viable for them to do it. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7039.5599999999995s)]
*  They give them money to do it. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7042.32s)]
*  They they they they well, that sounds like they're paying in the shit on the street. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7043.88s)]
*  No, they're paying them so that they don't have to be poor or homeless. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7047.28s)]
*  I mean, they have a tent and they they'll help them to subsidize this. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7052.04s)]
*  This existence, what they need is more mental health. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7055.48s)]
*  Is it? But it's a second girl. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7057.44s)]
*  We've drawn addiction and mental health. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7059.4s)]
*  That's that's the real problem. Yeah. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7060.92s)]
*  And when you don't address it and then you just allow people to camp [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7062.88s)]
*  anyway you want, you're almost sort of encouraging mental health problems [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7066.48s)]
*  to be everywhere all throughout and just be throughout the entire city. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7070.96s)]
*  It's just a lack of empathy for the people. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7074.92s)]
*  If you're empathetic for them, you don't let them just camp out and shit on the street. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7078.0s)]
*  What you do is you try to say, obviously, a real problem. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7081.88s)]
*  This needs to be addressed for the greater good of the city and for these people. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7085.080000000001s)]
*  They need mental health care. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7088.8s)]
*  They need addiction care. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7090.04s)]
*  They need it's a real problem that needs to be addressed. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7091.400000000001s)]
*  You can't just leave them out in the street and let them do whatever they want [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7094.68s)]
*  and become a hazard for everybody else. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7098.84s)]
*  Then it makes the city kind of fucked up. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7100.320000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't know what the I mean. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7102.320000000001s)]
*  You know, when you talk, when you speak, it's it sounds like more of a political choice. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7104.96s)]
*  No, someone's saying, well, it sounds like you're saying they're being, [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7109.6s)]
*  you know, paid to shit on the streets and become mentally ill. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7114.0s)]
*  I should on the streets. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7117.240000000001s)]
*  They are mentally ill. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7118.360000000001s)]
*  Illness happened first before living on the street. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7119.4400000000005s)]
*  Unquestionably. It's all during the Reagan administration, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7122.200000000001s)]
*  when they opened up the mental health institutes and just let people out in the streets. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7124.360000000001s)]
*  Well, it started before that in New York. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7127.8s)]
*  And that was my experience in New York was [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7129.68s)]
*  like Rockefeller way back when. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7132.4400000000005s)]
*  And I could be wrong, but this is how I was attributed. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7136.4s)]
*  Sort of opened up the mental closed up the mental health hospitals and pushed [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7139.04s)]
*  these many, many, many people out on the streets. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7143.68s)]
*  Yeah. That had nowhere to nowhere to go. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7146.16s)]
*  And it wasn't like it wasn't a poverty situation, although it looks like it. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7149.84s)]
*  When you look at it, it's really a mental health situation. And [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7154.0s)]
*  a great number of these people have no interest in going into a place. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7157.92s)]
*  They would just as soon live on the street. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7163.4400000000005s)]
*  Their life is like an interior monologue that they can't control. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7164.96s)]
*  And and living in a home is no different than living on the street. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7169.16s)]
*  The thing is still going on. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7173.28s)]
*  The conversation is still going on inside the brain. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7174.4800000000005s)]
*  But it has to be a solution for it. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7177.360000000001s)]
*  Well, OK. So I don't disagree that there has to be a solution. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7179.2s)]
*  But I don't I don't think that people are. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7184.12s)]
*  This is sort of like where, you know, I'd like to think about, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7186.599999999999s)]
*  let's not talk politics, let's agree on what we can agree on. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7189.639999999999s)]
*  So that solution is like this is where the great minds [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7194.2s)]
*  of California or the United States need to come together and say, OK, these are [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7198.28s)]
*  why don't we solve these problems that are common to every [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7203.679999999999s)]
*  every state has a city that has [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7208.12s)]
*  X number of people living on the street, whether it's Yankton [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7211.92s)]
*  you know, whether it's, you know, Minneapolis, whether it's, you know, Louisville, whatever. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7216.96s)]
*  Everyone's got like a street scene situation that's rough like that. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7222.879999999999s)]
*  And it's it's hard to say, let's, you know, you say there's got to be a solution. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7227.2s)]
*  Where is it where is that going to come from and who's going to believe it [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7232.32s)]
*  from if it comes from this direction or that direction or this side or that side? [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7236.44s)]
*  How do you how do you like [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7240.92s)]
*  evaporate the walls of separation and say, like, how do we get [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7243.52s)]
*  how do we get the right people with the right minds to solve these questions? [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7247.64s)]
*  You know, these are these are real things. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7253.88s)]
*  And and people argue about them when I mean, you and I are, [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7255.88s)]
*  you know, arguing what we're talking about. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7259.56s)]
*  Yeah. And neither one of us are sleeping on the street. Right. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7261.200000000001s)]
*  We both feel compassion for it, you know, empathy for it. But. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7264.8s)]
*  But how do you get people that are far removed? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7268.84s)]
*  And we could say we're far removed from it to, like, [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7272.679999999999s)]
*  allow the solution to take place from one side or the other. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7276.92s)]
*  From one side. Yeah. Any side who gives a damn who's got it right. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7280.5199999999995s)]
*  What has to be a completely bipartisan thing? [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7283.28s)]
*  We have to look at it in terms of the health of human beings in our community. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7286.36s)]
*  Right. This country is supposed to be our community. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7290.2s)]
*  These people that are on the street, they are sad, sick people in our community. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7292.4s)]
*  And some real effort has to be taken to try to change that [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7296.92s)]
*  instead of just enable them to keep doing it. That's all I'm saying. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7300.08s)]
*  I just don't think that the solution is let them camp wherever they want. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7303.36s)]
*  Let them shit in the streets. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7306.04s)]

*  you know, people call it a platform or a place where [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7315.12s)]
*  you invite people to come here that are that can speak to a lot of people. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7320.4s)]

*  when there's people that make sense, you hear it. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7334.4s)]

*  I wish I knew the answer to to to solving these things. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7340.88s)]
*  And occasionally, like I say, you see people with these problem solvers. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7344.88s)]
*  And the problem solvers come. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7349.16s)]
*  But, you know, people want to choose their own problem solver. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7352.36s)]
*  You know, it's like money and being a problem solver. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7354.84s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7358.28s)]
*  One of the parts of the big parts of the problem in California, in particular, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7359.400000000001s)]
*  is that there's an enormous budget to deal with the homeless. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7363.64s)]
*  So you have these people that work in these departments [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7366.360000000001s)]
*  that are making quarter million dollars a year that are just work on the homeless [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7370.72s)]
*  problem, which keeps getting worse every year. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7375.2s)]
*  There's no incentive to fix anything or change anything. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7377.12s)]
*  And it's a bunch of bureaucracy. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7380.360000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of bullshit that gets involved in the business. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7381.76s)]
*  I have a buddy of mine who's a lawyer who went to San Francisco and he was [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7385.04s)]
*  disturbed by it all. He's like, this is so crazy. Like, what is missing? [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7388.64s)]
*  Do we need more funding? [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7391.68s)]
*  And they're like, no, you know, this guy explained to him, no, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7393.0s)]
*  they literally have an incentive to keep the homeless problem. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7395.8s)]
*  There's an enormous number of people that are making a fantastic living [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7399.6s)]
*  and dealing with the homeless issue. Money on the homeless. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7403.2s)]
*  There's a giant list of people we could pull it up if you want to say, well, [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7406.52s)]
*  we don't need to call them out. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7409.400000000001s)]
*  But there's a bunch of people. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7410.44s)]
*  Who makes money on the homeless? [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7412.4s)]
*  The people that are involved in these organizations that are dealing [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7414.36s)]
*  with the homeless, whether it's in Los Angeles or in San Francisco. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7419.2s)]
*  You mean, are they like government? [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7421.839999999999s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, they're all government jobs. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7424.0s)]
*  Yes. It's all funded by the state. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7425.839999999999s)]
*  And there's real jobs, like real money. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7428.12s)]
*  And nothing gets done. Nothing changes. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7430.799999999999s)]
*  In fact, it gets worse every year. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7432.599999999999s)]
*  Something needs to be done that shows results. What is that? [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7434.2s)]
*  I think it's got to be compassionate. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7437.28s)]
*  It's got to be something that both the left and the right can agree to. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7439.28s)]
*  So here's so I'm trying to follow you. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7441.88s)]
*  OK, God knows I'm trying. So I have an art. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7444.08s)]
*  So no, no, I think we were talking earlier about [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7446.48s)]
*  the agents versus the architects or something like that. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7452.32s)]
*  Used a word that explained like the people who are like [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7455.639999999999s)]
*  coming up with the sort of thing. It's like. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7458.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was watching something and I've really tried to avoid watching the news [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7461.12s)]
*  lately, but I saw someone talking about and it was someone that works [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7464.88s)]
*  and you say the word bureaucracy and it's it's a loaded word. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7469.08s)]
*  And everyone and we all hate bureaucracy. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7472.16s)]
*  There's just a word of it. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7475.0s)]
*  Yeah. Gives you like a creepy feeling. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7476.08s)]
*  Frustrating word. Yeah. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7477.96s)]
*  And so, you know, it's like being on hold for Amtrak or whatever the hell it is. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7479.56s)]
*  You know, you know, there's someone, you know. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7483.12s)]
*  Oh, please, God, come back. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7489.56s)]
*  OK, so please, God, come back. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7491.400000000001s)]
*  So the idea that and so there's this person was talking about [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7494.88s)]
*  the cuts that are going to come and to talk about eliminating the bureaucracy. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7498.96s)]
*  And I don't know what particular department this person was. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7503.0s)]
*  No, that's not what this person was talking about. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7505.84s)]
*  But you are going to be a different person. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7508.24s)]
*  It's just a different person. I don't know what your person is. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7509.56s)]
*  This is my person. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7511.320000000001s)]
*  My person is saying. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7512.6s)]
*  The bureaucracy is like the bureaucracy gets sort of like [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7514.92s)]
*  fed from above somehow or other. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7519.52s)]
*  It's fed by these people that are the architects of one side or the other. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7521.68s)]
*  But the actual bureaucracy includes the people that can [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7525.24s)]
*  solve the problem like encased in this bureaucracy [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7529.0s)]
*  are people that can solve the problems. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7533.24s)]
*  And that if you just sort of. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7535.8s)]
*  You know, I'm not saying this is the case, but if you sort of just like [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7538.360000000001s)]
*  zip a bunch of the bureaucracy out, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7541.64s)]
*  you run the risk of zipping out some of the people [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7544.52s)]
*  that actually have the brains to do the solutions. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7547.96s)]
*  And that and what this person said was [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7551.28s)]
*  the solution to the bureaucracy is within the bureaucracy that [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7554.400000000001s)]
*  is is is finding the people that know what they can what can be done, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7559.12s)]
*  because they really do have the data. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7564.400000000001s)]
*  They really do work. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7567.12s)]
*  They actually do show up for work. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7568.84s)]
*  And they actually have the data on how to do this thing. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7571.16s)]
*  But because it keeps being fed from above all the time, there's just all this. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7573.56s)]
*  Extra debris and noise that keeps coming down, that [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7580.24s)]
*  causes more clutter and more splitting and more something. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7584.28s)]
*  Yeah. So. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7588.96s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to suggest that I could solve the question of bureaucracy [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7592.8s)]
*  today, but I think there's something about what we have. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7596.400000000001s)]
*  We we have the people. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7600.04s)]
*  You know, I'm going to go off on tangents now, but [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7602.400000000001s)]
*  I always kind of had an objection to Tom Brokaw's book, The Greatest Generation, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7606.04s)]
*  because I thought, why, damn it, that's not my generation. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7610.320000000001s)]
*  Why? How do they get that? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7613.04s)]
*  You know, but I did start reading some of it recently. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7614.76s)]
*  And he's to his credit, he's finding people [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7617.32s)]
*  that are very singular in that generation. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7620.84s)]
*  That which generation is he referring to? [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7625.04s)]
*  He's talking about the generation that won World War Two. OK. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7626.92s)]
*  And that generation was formed by the Great Depression. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7631.12s)]
*  You know, it was that was part of what they had. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7635.24s)]
*  And then they had a world war that lasted five years. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7637.599999999999s)]
*  And it's really hard for people of a certain age to understand, [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7641.12s)]
*  you know, like you think you have problems with your relationship. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7644.76s)]
*  Have your have your your lover go away for five years [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7647.5599999999995s)]
*  and see how well you're doing upon that person's return. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7651.36s)]
*  Right. See what the hell that's like for five years. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7655.24s)]
*  And like you didn't answer my letter, you know, my letter. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7657.599999999999s)]
*  Right. Oh, your letter. What letter? [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7661.08s)]
*  You know, that your letter never came. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7663.679999999999s)]
*  I was under fire, whatever it was. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7665.84s)]
*  And then they come back shell shocked. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7667.8s)]
*  And then you come back with shell shock on top of it. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7668.88s)]
*  And then back then, the sort of kind of I don't want to say it a macho thing. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7671.16s)]
*  But back then, people just didn't want to talk about it, [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7674.72s)]
*  which to me was there. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7677.68s)]
*  What is part of what created the hippie generation was [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7679.04s)]
*  kids couldn't get their parents to talk about anything that they thought mattered. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7684.2s)]
*  Right. They what their parents were talking about was like, huh? [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7689.360000000001s)]
*  Wait, what about peace? [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7692.88s)]
*  Love it. What's so wrong about peace, love and understand? Right. Right. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7694.76s)]
*  So and they couldn't get to that because even the idea of peace [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7698.400000000001s)]
*  was a completely different concept to someone that lived through a world war. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7703.4s)]
*  Yeah. Or lived through a depression. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7708.68s)]
*  So these kids were like, I don't even understand who these people are. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7710.64s)]
*  I know I'm their flesh and blood, but I don't know that. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7714.28s)]
*  I don't know what the hell they know and why they're this way. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7717.96s)]
*  But he chose people that very that lived a very intentional [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7720.72s)]
*  purpose in during that very, very difficult, challenging time [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7726.44s)]
*  where they just went, I don't know what I don't know. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7730.759999999999s)]
*  I don't know what all this is. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7733.759999999999s)]
*  But I do what I do know. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7735.04s)]
*  I do know what I do know and stay through that. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7736.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's I guess that I don't know how this relates me to this idea of bureaucracy. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7739.799999999999s)]
*  But people that do know the facts have got to stay with the facts, [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7745.16s)]
*  even in the face of like all the blunderbussing above about, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7749.92s)]
*  you know, there's this and there's that. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7754.879999999999s)]
*  You've got to be really dedicated to [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7756.6s)]
*  what you do know and and realize that there's [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7760.88s)]
*  lots that you don't know. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7765.160000000001s)]
*  But if you give up what you know in the name of. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7766.160000000001s)]
*  You know, jostling over here. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7770.6s)]
*  You know, then there's even more lost. Yeah. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7775.120000000001s)]
*  No, I agree. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7779.92s)]
*  And I think most people get involved, particularly if they get involved [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7781.400000000001s)]
*  in something like homeless or, you know, any any charitable organization. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7784.52s)]
*  Most of the people get involved aren't doing it cynically. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7790.0s)]
*  They're not doing it to get that big paycheck. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7792.6s)]
*  Their initial reason for being involved in something like that is to help. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7794.4800000000005s)]
*  The problem is sometimes when they realize it's just a big clog [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7798.160000000001s)]
*  and you're not going to be able to do any meaningful good, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7803.080000000001s)]
*  then things get weird and then you just sort of exist off of this system [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7806.320000000001s)]
*  that's not doing anybody any good. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7810.6s)]
*  This is his argument about why so many people are working on this. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7812.44s)]
*  Nothing's getting better. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7815.759999999999s)]
*  So who's this one? My friend, Colion Noir. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7816.92s)]
*  This is my friend who's a lawyer who went to San Francisco and and saw this. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7819.4s)]
*  And so and had a conversation with someone who is actually [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7824.96s)]
*  in government in San Francisco is explaining what the problem actually is. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7829.08s)]
*  And the government, people say it's just it's the government. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7834.04s)]
*  Now they just say there's no incentive. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7836.759999999999s)]
*  There's no incentive for them to do a better job. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7839.2s)]
*  And there's a very compassionate perspective in the city. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7842.48s)]
*  They're very kind people, and they don't want to take these homeless people [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7847.0s)]
*  and remove them. And that this sort of suicidal empathy [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7850.759999999999s)]
*  that they have for the people in their city is causing this rash of tents [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7855.4s)]
*  everywhere and crime. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7860.28s)]
*  And, you know, you can't have to leave your fucking car unlocked, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7861.759999999999s)]
*  otherwise they're going to smash your windows. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7864.679999999999s)]
*  And it's just that's what his perspective is. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7866.16s)]
*  It's that there's no real incentive to do anything different [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7869.32s)]
*  because these people are still getting paid to keep it the way it is. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7873.759999999999s)]
*  It's not the amount of money they make is not based on how much good they do. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7876.759999999999s)]
*  So like if if they're financially, if they're incentivized to like [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7881.88s)]
*  you get paid more, if more people clean up, seek treatment, [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7886.48s)]
*  get get on medication, get to a mental health institution, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7890.88s)]
*  if you can show some sort of progress, it'll affect how much money you get. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7894.96s)]
*  And vice versa, if you do, if you have no progress and nothing gets done [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7899.639999999999s)]
*  and the problem actually gets worse, perhaps you're not doing a good job. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7903.92s)]
*  Well, that sort of makes sense, doesn't it? [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7907.84s)]
*  It does. You get results. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7909.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. You know, you get encouraged by getting more money. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7910.88s)]
*  But yeah. So does this remind you of anything? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7913.599999999999s)]
*  It reminds me of everything. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7917.2s)]
*  Minds of the government itself. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7918.639999999999s)]
*  What does it remind you of? [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7920.719999999999s)]
*  Well, I feel like there's something hanging over our heads here. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7922.36s)]
*  That's like this situation. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7925.48s)]
*  And maybe it's just a continuous situation of of like a world [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7927.679999999999s)]
*  that gets more and more people all the time. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7931.959999999999s)]
*  And then more people want to have a voice. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7934.5599999999995s)]
*  And there's just more people shouting all at once. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7936.919999999999s)]
*  And there's there's we don't there's not quite the same kind of agreement. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7940.08s)]
*  We don't have like an ideal that we're all working for. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7944.24s)]
*  You know, I guess not that like cheap, but, you know, that the greatest generation, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7947.959999999999s)]
*  they had to fight a war to maybe save the sort of structure of Western civilization. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7953.84s)]
*  Right. And there is that argument, you know, right, that if the Nazi Party had done [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7960.8s)]
*  had defeated England and, you know, you know, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7965.52s)]
*  you know, life would be different. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7971.28s)]
*  Life would have been different, you know, and if and if that kind of dictatorship [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7972.76s)]
*  kind of world had gone further, you know, that we'd have been [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7976.76s)]
*  it would have been a different world. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7981.879999999999s)]
*  It wouldn't have grown the way it is. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7984.16s)]
*  But now it's grown. It's there's this freedom. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7986.16s)]
*  The war was fought. I believe. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7988.879999999999s)]
*  There was a great quote, one of those books like [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7993.04s)]
*  there's no such thing as a bad piece or something like that. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7996.879999999999s)]
*  There's all kinds of different. But [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=7999.32s)]
*  I feel like this [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8002.919999999999s)]
*  like there's no no sort of idea that we can agree that people can agree on. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8005.0s)]
*  That's the source of like a reason for being. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8010.04s)]
*  Well, it's a very uniting thing to be altogether against a common enemy [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8013.56s)]
*  that is real, like World War Two. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8020.32s)]
*  Like there's a real purpose to life. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8022.96s)]
*  People understand that this is a very important mission. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8025.32s)]
*  This is something that unfortunately, it's one of the best ways to unite. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8028.44s)]
*  People is a threat from the outside. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8032.88s)]
*  That's what we've come up with. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8035.76s)]
*  Well, that's what happened after 9-11. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8036.72s)]
*  Remember 9-11 everywhere in L.A. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8039.4s)]
*  People driving around with American flags on their car. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8041.68s)]
*  I forget 9-11, what it was like to walk down the streets in New York after 9-11. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8044.28s)]
*  There was nothing like it I've ever experienced in my whole life. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8048.08s)]
*  It was bizarre. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8051.64s)]
*  And but it was also very united, like people were together. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8052.5599999999995s)]
*  People looked into each other's eyes. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8054.88s)]
*  You walk by someone on the street. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8057.0s)]
*  Yeah. And every person on the street looked right in your eyes. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8058.36s)]
*  Yeah. And that lasted for weeks. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8061.72s)]
*  I never I mean, people in New York walk with their head down. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8064.48s)]
*  They look right. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8067.04s)]
*  They're reading a paper. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8069.04s)]
*  But people just looking by like, OK, we're in this. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8070.16s)]
*  Yeah. Together. Yeah. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8073.0s)]
*  And I think some people actually obviously hated the act of what happened, [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8074.5199999999995s)]
*  but loved the way people reacted and how people felt with each other. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8080.48s)]
*  It did feel different. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8085.24s)]
*  New York City felt friendly. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8086.6s)]
*  It felt united. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8088.48s)]
*  It felt like people were proud to be American. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8089.88s)]
*  We were all together. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8092.0s)]
*  There's bad people out there. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8093.68s)]
*  They did this to us. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8094.88s)]
*  But we're all together. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8095.96s)]
*  Well, OK, so what we have here with the situation of like [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8097.44s)]
*  just using San Francisco as the idea is like it's just a gentler [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8100.64s)]
*  version of something that we could all say this is something that we have to. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8105.12s)]
*  Yes. Go to war about. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8108.84s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's a tax. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8110.92s)]
*  Yeah. Any any kind of a problem that we have as a group [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8112.84s)]
*  that we all are affected by. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8116.4s)]
*  Yes. Care about. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8118.44s)]
*  Well, it's too easy to ignore. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8120.2s)]
*  It's too easy to just say, oh, there's the tents. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8121.84s)]
*  Let's go this way. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8123.72s)]
*  And the reality is the health of the community, [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8124.76s)]
*  it's dependent upon the health of the lowest members of the community [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8128.4800000000005s)]
*  on the social rung. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8132.68s)]
*  The lowest members of the people that are sick. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8133.64s)]
*  And if you don't take care of them, if you don't take care [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8136.0s)]
*  of the people that are mentally ill, that are homeless, [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8138.4400000000005s)]
*  that are addicted to drugs, that are on the street, that are desolate, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8140.2s)]
*  that don't have friends, don't have love, don't have structure, [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8142.56s)]
*  don't have anything that they can call upon. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8144.92s)]
*  Horrible childhood, the whole deal. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8146.76s)]
*  If you don't if you don't look at them, then your society's sick [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8148.6s)]
*  because this is the foundation of the society is the people. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8151.919999999999s)]
*  If you've got a group of people that are part of your community [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8154.799999999999s)]
*  and you're completely ignoring their plight, that's not good for anybody. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8157.5599999999995s)]
*  That's not good for big business. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8161.16s)]
*  That's not good for the common folk. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8162.44s)]
*  That's not good for people in the neighborhood. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8164.679999999999s)]
*  It's not good for anybody. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8166.44s)]
*  And it's gotten so far because it's so big now. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8167.879999999999s)]
*  The problem is so enormous. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8171.04s)]
*  It's almost too big to tackle. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8172.32s)]
*  It's almost like, OK, you're dealing with L.A. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8174.08s)]
*  You're dealing with a hundred thousand people living on the street. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8175.879999999999s)]
*  That's so many fucking people. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8179.28s)]
*  That's the entire population of Boulder. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8180.76s)]
*  That's Boulder, Colorado, intense on the street in L.A. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8183.320000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. It's almost too big. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_fM6v64-NQ&t=8187.04s)]
