# JRE MMA Show #133 with Sean O'Malley
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=0.0s)]
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6.0s)]
*  I don't know why that doesn't make sense. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10.0s)]
*  Well for a fight I know I'm prepared. I know I have 8 to 10 weeks to prepare for that moment. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=18.0s)]
*  I guess you could prepare for comedy if you know you're making people laugh and you know you have a good bit. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=24.0s)]
*  That might make it easier, but to go up there and freestyle it would be hard. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=30.0s)]
*  That would be impossible pretty much for a newbie. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=34.0s)]
*  Well you could, it depends on your personality. There's people who could freestyle it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=36.0s)]
*  I'm sure Joey Diaz could freestyle it his first time on stage. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=40.0s)]
*  It's just all in who you are. I can't. I prepared my shit for months in advance. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=44.0s)]
*  I even recorded it on a little tape recorder and played it back and listened to it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=50.0s)]
*  You still do that? Record and listen to it? No. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=54.0s)]
*  I record sets, but I don't just talk into my tape recorder and then listen to that like it's a bit and rehearse it like it's a bit. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah comedy would, I can watch it, I just don't know if I can ever do it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=66.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm a funny person. When I'm around my group of friends, around comfortable people, I feel like I can make people laugh. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=72.0s)]
*  Sometimes when I get really high I feel like I have good bits. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=78.0s)]
*  And then I'll tell someone after I'm not high, I'm like yeah that was not it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=82.0s)]
*  But when you're in the moment maybe you could have figured out how to translate it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=86.0s)]
*  The problem is when you're sober then you're reading like what the fuck was I saying? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=91.0s)]
*  I do that all the time. I have notes on my phone so if I'm out and I just have a crazy idea I'll write it down on my phone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=95.0s)]
*  And then I'll go look at them the next day to see if I mined any gold. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=103.0s)]
*  I'm like what do I got, what do I got? But so many times it's like what the fuck are you saying? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah I like the way you talk about it though. I think it was even one of the recent podcasts you were saying it's just like such an infant when you have an idea. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=111.0s)]
*  And then you slowly kind of add to it, add to it, add to it until it's like the whole bit. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=118.0s)]
*  But you never know because sometimes they come out like full grown. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah. Sometimes they just pop out of your head and you just have an idea. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=127.0s)]
*  It's fucking funny. It's like a full grown idea. But not always. They're all different. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=130.0s)]
*  It's a tough job. I have a weird theory about ideas. It's not substantiated nor do I expect it to be taken seriously. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=134.0s)]
*  But I think ideas might be life forms. I think we're very limited in the way we think about life forms. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=142.0s)]
*  You know we think of life forms as something that breeds and something that grows in the ground or whatever. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=149.0s)]
*  That's what we think of life forms. But if you think about every fucking thing on earth, everything, this microphone I'm talking to, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=155.0s)]
*  the airplane that got you here, the sneakers that are on your feet, every fucking thing came out of an idea. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=162.0s)]
*  An idea got into a person's mind and then that person made that idea. And we're like people are so creative and we certainly are. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=169.0s)]
*  But where the fuck are these ideas coming from? These ideas that manifest themselves in the form of physical things like televisions and automobiles and cell phones. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=177.0s)]
*  Where the, what is that? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=191.0s)]
*  So you think they could just be floating around in different dimensions? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=192.0s)]
*  Maybe if we were on some kind of drugs we could see certain ideas floating around and you grab that one, put it in your mind? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=195.0s)]
*  It might be that way. It might be that your mind tunes in to these things that are out there. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=201.0s)]
*  And like the more you can tune in, the more successful you'll be. Right? So the more you'll have an incentive to tune in and make more stuff. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=206.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=216.0s)]
*  You know and people are rewarded for being successful and making stuff out of ideas. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=222.0s)]
*  Fucking weird, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=223.0s)]
*  I mean, fuck, yeah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=226.0s)]
*  Like where are they coming from? We're just, the most important thing that human life has ever had is ideas. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=227.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=234.0s)]
*  Because those ideas turned us from these primates living in the jungle like regular animals to someone who lives in a fucking apartment building on the 32nd floor and has Wi-Fi. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=235.0s)]
*  That's what turned us into that. Ideas. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=243.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's fucking crazy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=246.0s)]
*  It might be life forms. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=248.0s)]
*  I feel like I have very few brilliant ideas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=250.0s)]
*  Good. Thank God for the people that do figure out the important shit. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=253.0s)]
*  We need a lot of people to think of important shit. I have a joke about that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=257.0s)]
*  But you remember those folks that got trapped on that island? There's an island called North Central Island and it's in the middle of the Indian Ocean. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=261.0s)]
*  There's only like 39 people on it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=268.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=270.0s)]
*  It's where there was a missionary a couple years back. He went to deliver Bibles to them and he murdered them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=271.0s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=276.0s)]
*  But these people, we're talking about uncontacted people and I'm saying they don't have a chance. That's them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=277.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=285.0s)]
*  There's not enough of them. There's only 39 of them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=286.0s)]
*  To get a society like we have, you need fucking millions of people. And there's only like four or five people to figure out everything. And we buy all their shit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=289.0s)]
*  And those are the guys that are going to live if another, I was listening to the Graham Hancock one, those are the guys that are going to survive if another apocalypse happens. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=300.0s)]
*  Yeah, something crazy happens. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=309.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're not going to make it. They're not going to miss a beat. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=311.0s)]
*  No, no, no, yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=314.0s)]
*  They're out there with bows and arrows hunting and fishing and living off the land and they've been doing that for thousands of years. They're going to be fine. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like such a bitch when I think of those guys. I'm so helpless. I can whoop someone's ass but it doesn't really mean much when it comes down to it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=322.0s)]
*  You could do it. You could do exactly what they're doing if you were thrust into that situation. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=329.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=333.0s)]
*  100%. 100% dude. You'd be like that dude in Avatar who just adapts and becomes one of the Navi. You would just adapt. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=334.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like languages I guess too. You just submerge yourself in another country. I was in Mexico recently and I was like damn. My wife's from Oaxaca. Her first language is Spanish. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=342.0s)]
*  I've been with her for like seven years so I've learned a little bit. I was trying to speak it there but I was like damn, I feel like I could learn it if I was here for like three months. I'd just be speaking it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=353.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's some method that I was reading about that is some tried and true method for learning language that allows you to be functional in a language in 30 days. See if you can find out what the fuck that is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=362.0s)]
*  It might have just been a marketing scheme. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=377.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=380.0s)]
*  I might have got sucked into it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=381.0s)]
*  These fucking stars are tripping me out. I keep seeing them. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=382.0s)]
*  Learn a new language in 30 days. Yeah, Pimsleur method. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=385.0s)]
*  That is an ad but that's what I'm talking about. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=388.0s)]
*  It is an ad. Focuses on conversational skills. Start actually speaking today. I heard that Rosetta is good too right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=389.0s)]
*  Rosetta's dope. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=396.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Elena, she's two. My daughter, she's learning English and Spanish at the same time so she'll say like, she's starting to say two or three word sentences. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=397.0s)]
*  Some will be in English and Spanish and it's just a trip to see how their little brains work. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=407.0s)]
*  It's supposed to be really good for child's development to be learning languages simultaneously. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=412.0s)]
*  Yeah. Danny's mom's our full time nanny and she only speaks Spanish. She's with her Monday, Wednesday, Friday and then sometimes on the weekends. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=417.0s)]
*  So she's learning like, Spanish could be her primary language at first. Yeah, I know it's fucking interesting. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=424.0s)]
*  It's one of the more important things supposedly to like, keep your mind from atrophying is like, learning language. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=433.0s)]
*  Like learning language is like a really difficult thing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=440.0s)]
*  So they say that like, there's a few things that you can do to kind of stave off mental deterioration. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=443.0s)]
*  One of them is like, crossword puzzles. Like doing things where your mind, it just makes sense. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=450.0s)]
*  Like you make your mind work and what makes your mind work more than learning a language? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=455.0s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. I remember when I was a, I haven't, what was it? Duolingo or some shit? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=459.0s)]
*  One of the apps. I would go every day. Well, maybe not every day, but pretty much every day. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=464.0s)]
*  Go to the coffee shop and before practice I would read. I would go there for an hour. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=468.0s)]
*  I'd go and like read for half an hour and then Duolingo for half an hour for a long time. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=472.0s)]
*  And I got decent at it, but it's just like, you don't, you lose what you don't use or whatever the fuck that is. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=476.0s)]
*  That's so true. Because that was like a while back when I first moved to Arizona and first met Danny. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=481.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to be able to talk to her in her language and then did it for a while. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=486.0s)]
*  I was like, fuck that. I got it a lot when I was in high school. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=490.0s)]
*  I had Spanish and I got to a point where I can almost have conversations in class, you know, like crude conversations in class. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=494.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking at the time, oh, this is great because now I always know how to talk like a little bit of Spanish. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=501.0s)]
*  That shit was gone in like six months, six months after I graduated high school was gone. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was, I was some coffee. Fuck it. I might take some coffee. Yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=511.0s)]
*  I was surprised. I was doing pretty good. I think Tim, Tim went with me to Mexico. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=515.0s)]
*  He was impressed. I was trying to have conversations. And the thing is, is like when you when you're when I was there, it wasn't like as embarrassing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=518.0s)]
*  But like when I tried to do it with Danny or her mom or like, yeah, I just feel like a fucking idiot. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=526.0s)]
*  Imagine how foreigners feel talking to us, you know, that's why it's so rude to mock them. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=531.0s)]
*  Yeah. Danny, Danny moved to America when she was nine, went to just a normal school and no one spoke English. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=535.0s)]
*  She only spoke Spanish and she was like just submerged into it and just slowly had to learn like she went to English class, obviously. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=542.0s)]
*  But it's hard when she said there was one girl in her in her class that spoke like broken, broken Spanish. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=548.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. Imagine trying to like fit in and learn a new culture while you're learning the language. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=554.0s)]
*  You have totally different culture, totally different environment and totally different language. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=560.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's it's impressive. I mean, it's like you don't really have a choice when you're nine and you just go to school. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=565.0s)]
*  It's like you don't have a choice but learn. Right. Most nine year old kids freak out if they have to move to a new neighborhood. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=570.0s)]
*  Yeah. They got to make new friends. It's like traumatic. Yeah. You did a lot of moving. Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=576.0s)]
*  Well, when I moved my kids here, there was like I'm like this is like kind of at the wire where I can't move them anymore. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=581.0s)]
*  What age were they? Ten and twelve. OK. I was like this is like right. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=588.0s)]
*  And then we still had friends that visited. We have friends that also live in Texas. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=593.0s)]
*  Like this might work now. But if you move them when they're like 15, 16, not good, not good. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=597.0s)]
*  Yeah. I was trying to get my sister to move down when she was I think she was somewhat like freshman or sophomore and moved down to Phoenix from Montana. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=604.0s)]
*  And my mom was like, no, I didn't get it. I'm like, why? But thinking about it now, I'm like, yeah, that would have probably been hard for a girl. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=612.0s)]
*  It's rough. It's rough for everybody. If you especially girls, they go in these. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=620.0s)]
*  It's like a natural bullying instinct. Yeah. Like teenage girls have fucking mean to each other. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=625.0s)]
*  Fucking mean to each other, dude. I get I get privy to some text message exchanges as some of these kids have. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=631.0s)]
*  What the fuck, man? And parents get confronted by their kid being like horrible and saying horrible shit to people. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=636.0s)]
*  Kids telling kids to kill themselves like wild shit. Not no kids I know did. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=644.0s)]
*  Let me just state that. But I do know that that was like a thing where a girl was arrested and she wound up being held guilty. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=649.0s)]
*  She was a teenager. She broke up with this guy and she convinced him to kill himself. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=657.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Remember that Netflix or some shit I watched. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=661.0s)]
*  What? I mean, there's something about like teenage people that are just like learning how to be mean and learning how to like turn out and being scared of people doing it to you. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=665.0s)]
*  They're scared of people doing it to them. Yeah. And so they pile on each other like woo. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=673.0s)]
*  And you're not learning anything in school that's like communication skills or like going in inside yourself and feelings and like you're not learning any of that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=677.0s)]
*  So it's just imagine learning how to talk while you're texting. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=685.0s)]
*  Imagine learning how to communicate with people and you're doing more texting than you are actually communicating. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=689.0s)]
*  That's I mean, I think in seventh grade, I got my first flip phone, seventh, eighth grade. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=695.0s)]
*  So I was trying to I could talk to chicks texting. I could text them. Hey, like you could say anything. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=699.0s)]
*  But then in school, I cannot see him. I'd be like, I mean, I couldn't have a conversation. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=704.0s)]
*  I was so scared. But texting, I could say some whatever. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=708.0s)]
*  Well, it's like we were talking about stand up. It's just a thing you get used to doing. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=713.0s)]
*  You know, like you're used to fighting like for you. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=717.0s)]
*  I'm sure you get heightened senses and you get fired up and your adrenaline kicks in. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=720.0s)]
*  But this is a normal thing for you to this people that just would completely freeze and not even be able to walk into the cage. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=725.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They would have a panic attack. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=733.0s)]
*  But you've done it so many times. I think that's the kind of the case with all things that are difficult to do. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=735.0s)]
*  Yeah, that too. And it's like a skill you have to learn. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=740.0s)]
*  Because like Donald Throne, for example, it did it how many times and like I was in the backstage when of his last fight. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=744.0s)]
*  I fought. I don't remember who I fought, but I was in the back room. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=750.0s)]
*  He was walking up before me. He was warming up and he just looked not scared. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=756.0s)]
*  I don't know if they were nervous, like had this anxious energy and he's done more than anyone. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=760.0s)]
*  But it's just like I think if you want to fight well, that never really goes away. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=768.0s)]
*  I think you have confidence and I think you control it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=773.0s)]
*  And I think the best guys learn how to handle it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=776.0s)]
*  But, you know, when you're looking at like Alex Paheda looking at style bender in the face off, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=778.0s)]
*  like there has to be some crazy heightened sense of tension and awareness in the moment. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=787.0s)]
*  And it's it's a crazy big fight. I don't think you get away with that without not having that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=794.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think everybody has it. It's just some people handle it better. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=799.0s)]
*  And I think the guys that don't have it, I think sometimes they get in trouble. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=802.0s)]
*  Like some fights I've seen guys with just a little too calm, a little too confident, and then they get lit up. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=805.0s)]
*  It's almost like they can't wake themselves up. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=811.0s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah, for me, my last fight going there with Peter, I just felt I felt no nerves. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=813.0s)]
*  I felt so calm like and I've had nerves. I've had fights like my my debut when I fought Terry on where I remember like in the backstage that closed my eyes too long. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=820.0s)]
*  I was thinking like if I lose this and then lose one more, I could get cut like having that thought vividly. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=828.0s)]
*  And I was like, well, fuck that. OK, we'll like counter that obviously with some positive shit. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=833.0s)]
*  But going to that last fight had zero nerves. I don't know if it was I didn't feel like it was a win win. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=837.0s)]
*  I'm like I wasn't thinking like, oh, if I lose to Peter, like no one's going to care. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=842.0s)]
*  It was just I don't know what it was, but I felt it was confidence. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=846.0s)]
*  Obviously, I had a really good training camp, had a good everything weight cut. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=850.0s)]
*  But I wasn't nervous to to lose, but it wasn't because it was like to Peter. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=854.0s)]
*  It wasn't I don't know. You just had gotten into a good headspace to compete. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=860.0s)]
*  Maybe just like much better now at getting in the right headspace that allows you to compete at your best. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=864.0s)]
*  Yeah, because if you think about it, thinking about all those other things, those are not beneficial. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=870.0s)]
*  And you've experienced those in the past and you learn from it. Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=874.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it is. It's like there's these moments in in life where you you could think the wrong way and just go off the rails or you could manage it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=878.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a skill. It's a mental skill. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=887.0s)]
*  And I attribute that to all the things I do in preparation leading up to fights. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=889.0s)]
*  And I've had so many training camps now. I think that was my tenth fight in the UFC. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=894.0s)]
*  And then I had a ton of fights before that. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=899.0s)]
*  But I think it's just learning each camp a little bit more, a little bit more to prepare yourself for for that specific moment. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=901.0s)]
*  Fights are fucking weird because you like I had no plans for October 23rd. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=908.0s)]
*  The fight was October 22nd. Like it's just like you just plan on not dying, but you're just like there's nothing else that matters for 12 weeks. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=912.0s)]
*  I knew I was fighting him for a long time over three months. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=920.0s)]
*  There was nothing October 22nd was that date. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=923.0s)]
*  Nothing else mattered. It's crazy what kind of headspace you get into. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=926.0s)]
*  Into fight camp. And then after fight camp, it takes takes me like two, three weeks. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=930.0s)]
*  Like we're four weeks out tomorrow from that last fight to get back to just normal thinking and not just being like being at home, being a dad, being easy. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=935.0s)]
*  It's a weird mind space you get into in fight camp. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=945.0s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah, it's I mean, it's just a very disciplined mindset. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=948.0s)]
*  And then there's I know some fighters that don't really train and take it as serious like but everyone's different. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=953.0s)]
*  Well, I think you're figuring out how to do it right for you. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=961.0s)]
*  You know, you're you're dialing it in and I think the way you're doing is the right way. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=964.0s)]
*  I think it's the only way you make those big leaps. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=969.0s)]
*  I mean, you're in a fucking shark infested pond, man. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=973.0s)]
*  That is such a shark filled section of MMA. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=977.0s)]
*  That 135 pound division is wild, man. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=982.0s)]
*  Yeah. And no one weighs 135 pounds. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=985.0s)]
*  Dude, I heard Aljo say he was like 170 or something the other day. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=988.0s)]
*  Aljo's so big. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=992.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck? No one really doesn't want to fight till July. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=993.0s)]
*  Build is like the perfect 135 pound. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=996.0s)]
*  Like you can't get any bigger, any leaner. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=999.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, you know, there's like tweeners. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1002.0s)]
*  I think Diego Sanchez was always a tweener. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1004.0s)]
*  You know, he was like a little bit too small for 55. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1007.0s)]
*  And, you know, when he tried to make 45, like that was way too much of a weight cut. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1011.0s)]
*  And it's 70. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1016.0s)]
*  Like, I think he was small for those guys. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1017.0s)]
*  He beat a lot of good guys at all those weight classes like Diego and his prime was just but he was just an animal. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1020.0s)]
*  I was like, if there was a 160 pound division like somewhere in that range. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1025.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, that would be sweet if they had more divisions. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1030.0s)]
*  I know you guys always talk about that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1034.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think it should be every 10 pounds. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1035.0s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. 65. What is it? 75. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1038.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1042.0s)]
*  Because there's a thing too about guys who have too many fights with guys that are out of their weight class. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1043.0s)]
*  Like, I think it takes even more off of you. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1047.0s)]
*  You know, I think if you're a small guy in the weight class and you have wars with the bigger guys in the weight class, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1050.0s)]
*  I think it probably takes even more off of you. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1054.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and then I'll do my in my opinion, I think, you know, I walk around one. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1057.0s)]
*  I think I was 157, 158. I feel like that's that's prime. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1063.0s)]
*  He's he's walking around 170 when you get to 58. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1066.0s)]
*  Is it in like looming in the back your mind? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1070.0s)]
*  135. Oh, yeah, I don't get about I will not get above 160 because I know I have to eventually make weight. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1073.0s)]
*  And I think Aljoe like that's just too. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1079.0s)]
*  He's saying he doesn't want to fight, you know, the weight cut and all that. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1083.0s)]
*  But that's I mean, if you're going to be champion, look at Adesanya, he's fighting all the time. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1086.0s)]
*  If you're going to be champ, you got to be ready to go. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1091.0s)]
*  You can't get that big. What did you think about Adesanya when he went up and fight Jan Bojovic and he didn't even gain any weight? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1093.0s)]
*  So that was from one one eighty five to two oh five. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1100.0s)]
*  Yeah, he went from eighty five to two oh five and he won a win like one ninety four or something like that. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1103.0s)]
*  So he didn't do anything to try to gain weight. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1108.0s)]
*  He just didn't cut weight. It's probably what he walks around that before he fights in middleweight. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1110.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that was just a tough matchup for him to go up. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1115.0s)]
*  That's a lot of weight, too. It's not like going up 10 like for me to go up to 45. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1118.0s)]
*  It's only 10 pounds for him. Yeah, you know, going up 20 pounds to try to become double champ. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1121.0s)]
*  That's tough. That's like a shitty, shitty weight class to want to be double champ. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1125.0s)]
*  Unless you're Alex Perretta, I don't get how he because on the scale, he doesn't look super, super sucked in. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1129.0s)]
*  Like doesn't look like he just got done cutting 20 pounds, but that motherfucker is so massive. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1135.0s)]
*  He made Izzy look small. And I've been around Izzy. He's a big guy. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1140.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a long, tall man. And Paheta is just everything was so do you see Robert Whitaker said about it? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1144.0s)]
*  The big fella goes, you see the size of this man? I did. He's a freaking giant. Yeah, and he is. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1151.0s)]
*  That's an interest. They got to give Izzy the rematch, though, right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1158.0s)]
*  Oh, I would think for sure if Izzy wants that, I would think that's his. Yeah. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1161.0s)]
*  I mean, Izzy said he wanted it, but fuck, dude, he fought damn near perfect fight for a couple more minutes. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1165.0s)]
*  So he goes from. Yeah, from 83 kilograms to 99.3 kilograms. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1172.0s)]
*  So what is 99.3 kilograms? Is that like 220 something pounds? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1180.0s)]
*  Picture on the left, 219 on fight day. Yeah. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1184.0s)]
*  I mean, it's weird because when they weigh you on fight day, like they just grab us. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1187.0s)]
*  There's a scale. You have your shoes on and shit like that. You have a hoodie on. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1190.0s)]
*  They don't really make you take your shit off and weigh yourself. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1193.0s)]
*  219. He walks around. He weighs in at 184 and then he weighs in on the fight day at 219. That's crazy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1196.0s)]
*  That's so big. He's a heavyweight. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1206.0s)]
*  He's a fucking heavyweight. He's a heavyweight. He's like, look, if he had a little bit of fat on him, he's a heavyweight. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1210.0s)]
*  He's a heavyweight. Yeah, that's true. Like if you had Cain Velasquez looking, those are some busted up toes. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1216.0s)]
*  Those are some toes that will kick some elbows, man. That's the worst about every time I get in a fight. It's my fucking feet. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1223.0s)]
*  Look at those toes, son. Those toes have seen hell. That's a big fight, though. The rematch. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1229.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck yeah. The fourth fight. God, imagine Izzy lose again. He's just 4-0 to this guy. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1235.0s)]
*  Do you think if you were Izzy, should he take some time? Should he go right into the rematch in like six months? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1240.0s)]
*  Like if you were in his corner, what would you say to him? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1248.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I wonder if Alex is going to stick around and defend it with someone else. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1252.0s)]
*  Oh no, Alex would take that fight. That's such a cheap fight. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1257.0s)]
*  No, no, Alex. Yeah, Alex will. But I wonder if Izzy said, no, let's let someone else try to fight Alex. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1259.0s)]
*  I wonder if Alex is sticking around for that or if he's like, I'm going to go up to 205, try to fight Double Champ, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1263.0s)]
*  unless it's Glover, right? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1268.0s)]
*  No, he would never fight Glover. But that's actually a good point. If Yuri Prochaska beats Glover in the rematch, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1270.0s)]
*  and then he decides to avenge Glover and fight Yuri Prochaska, they got a great storyline. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1277.0s)]
*  What a storyline. Because Yuri is, he's got, obviously has grappling skills because he submitted Glover, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1283.0s)]
*  but that was in sort of a wild exchange and he caught him in a choke while they're in this. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1289.0s)]
*  And it was in hell. They were both in hell. I mean, they dragged each other to hell. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1295.0s)]
*  It was like as exhausted as you can be, as broken as you can be. Everybody got rocked. Everybody got hurt. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1299.0s)]
*  It was a crazy ass fight. Yuri did submit him. But they say Pajanas got a brown belt in Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1306.0s)]
*  Like he just got a brown belt in Jiu-Jitsu. Glover gave him his brown belt. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1313.0s)]
*  I don't know what it actually looks like if he thinks he's going to grapple. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1317.0s)]
*  I don't think he thought he was going to grapple. I would like to see if that's a real brown belt. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1320.0s)]
*  I would see him real grappling. But when it comes to hitting people, that fuck, dude, he's fucking technical too, man. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1327.0s)]
*  It's not just power. The way he's setting Izzy up, the left hook is murderous. And he checks kicks as good as anybody, man. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1334.0s)]
*  If you watch his left leg when he's fighting, when he's stomping forward, he checks everything. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1343.0s)]
*  He's checking all those calf kicks. But that was a big problem in the fight was that Izzy had landed some brutal, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1348.0s)]
*  or he had landed some brutal calf kicks on Izzy early on. I think it was like five or six in that first round. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1355.0s)]
*  Heavy. Heavy. Those are heavy too. His fucking fist, I met him when he fought Shit Strickland. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1362.0s)]
*  And his fist is like literally both mine put together. It was so massive. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1368.0s)]
*  And they're long. They're like long fists. Just a big fella. Just a big fucking fella. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1373.0s)]
*  His fucking highlight reel is like nobody else's. His highlight reel is so wild. You see his fight with Jason Willness? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1379.0s)]
*  No. Pull up Paheta, KO's Jason Willness. Is he kickboxing? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1387.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jason Willness was world champion. Jason Willness is like top of the food chain, elite kickboxer. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1393.0s)]
*  And he fought Paheta before. And he actually had beaten Paheta sometime early in Paheta's career. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1399.0s)]
*  But this fucking knockout is so wild. And you gotta remember, this is like the cream of the crop in glory. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1405.0s)]
*  You got it? Ah, damn it, Jamie. Here it goes. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1413.0s)]
*  God, he's such a long fucking... It's just like he's built different than everybody else. It's weird, man. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1420.0s)]
*  Like the kind of snap that he has in his shots. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1428.0s)]
*  Fucking Izzy Hadam. 10 more seconds on that first... No, 2, 3 more seconds on that first round. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1433.0s)]
*  First round he was fucked. He was fucked. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1438.0s)]
*  And he was... That right hand was perfect. There it is. So watch this. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1440.0s)]
*  So he drops Willness with a head kick. Willness is in trouble. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1446.0s)]
*  Just stands there like a fucking killer. He kick through his hip. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1452.0s)]
*  Oh! Bro. Jesus. That is... That's how he knocked that dude out in the UFC too. That fucking... [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1457.0s)]
*  His flying knee is monstrous. He's knocked a bunch of people out with flying knees. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1464.0s)]
*  And then he gets on the top of the fucking ropes and screams like a monster. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1468.0s)]
*  Like listen to the sounds he makes when he screams. Watch this. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1473.0s)]
*  That's that completeness. That was a head kick. That dude is a legitimate ancestor of people that were like tribal folks in Brazil on the Amazon. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1478.0s)]
*  He looks like it. He is, man. That's superior genetics, son. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1488.0s)]
*  Those knees, those long fellas. Bro, that's some crazy genetics. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1494.0s)]
*  Yeah, perfect for fighting that style. And he's got a nice body. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1500.0s)]
*  And the technique, man. He's fucking technical. When he was walking down Izzy, when they were hand fighting and he was checking these kicks. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1505.0s)]
*  This is dangerous in every way. It's not just dangerous power. He's fucking sneaky. He's really technical and creative when he's hitting people. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1515.0s)]
*  Yeah, slick. That pressure he was putting on Izzy too. Just slow, forward. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1524.0s)]
*  And he's fighting strange. It's like hands down, straight up. And he moves in on you. It's so filled with danger. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1528.0s)]
*  Every step he moves towards, guys, you see this recognition of this. It's a different kind of power. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1537.0s)]
*  I would be so curious to see him versus Robert Whitaker. But I feel like he's going to make Whitaker look tiny. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1544.0s)]
*  Yeah, but Whitaker's got wrestling. Whitaker's got real wrestling. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1550.0s)]
*  Yeah, or Marvin. Marvin's a thick bastard. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1554.0s)]
*  Marvin's a big fuck. He's a big fuck. You stand at that guy, you're like, how do you make 85? He's huge. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1557.0s)]
*  Yeah, Marvin's a big fuck. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1563.0s)]
*  So guys like that that have good grappling, big, strong guys, that's going to be interesting. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1564.0s)]
*  Because I don't know whether or not he can keep those guys off of him. And also, I don't know, we really don't know what it's like for him to fight five rounds with a grappler. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1569.0s)]
*  This time struggle grappling with Izzy. Perhaps he wasn't prepared because he didn't expect it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1579.0s)]
*  But still, he got dominated in one round on the ground by Izzy. If a real elite grappler gets a hold of him, you know. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1584.0s)]
*  From what we saw from that Izzy verse, that little exchange on the ground, I'd assume a guy like Marvin would take his back, choke him. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1593.0s)]
*  What if he got in there with a guy like Rodolfo Vieira? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1602.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1605.0s)]
*  What if he got in there with one of those big Brazilian Jiu Jitsu like Jack Blackbelts? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1606.0s)]
*  God, I can't imagine shooting on that dude though. Knowing those knees. Knowing those knees are right up the middle like that. Fuck. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1611.0s)]
*  Well, especially in the first round when he's fresh, like you're not going to get to those hips. Like you're going to run into some shit maybe. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1619.0s)]
*  How old is he? 34, 35? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1626.0s)]
*  34, I believe. 34. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1628.0s)]
*  So he's not too, I mean, he's got a, if he wants to fight in his prime, he probably got a couple more in him. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1629.0s)]
*  A couple more years to be at the elite level. But then you look at Glover, and you're like, how is he doing that? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1634.0s)]
*  How is he fighting at that level? Like when he stopped Behovich and choked him, when he dropped him and took him down, he just ran through him. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1640.0s)]
*  Like Jan Behovich was the fucking light heavyweight champion and Glover just ran through him. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1647.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was legendary. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1651.0s)]
*  41 years old at the time? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1652.0s)]
*  Damn, he's that old? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1654.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro. I think he won it at 41. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1656.0s)]
*  So is he 42 now? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1658.0s)]
*  42 now fighting, what is that, December 10? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1660.0s)]
*  December 10, the rematch. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1662.0s)]
*  42? Holy shit, how old is Yuri? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1664.0s)]
*  Younger, much younger. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1668.0s)]
*  That's crazy, 42. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1670.0s)]
*  I hold a year for Hasuka. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1672.0s)]
*  It doesn't say, they want to tell you on UFC. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1674.0s)]
*  They'll hide that shit. I would want, I mean, I think it's a selling point, honestly. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1676.0s)]
*  Especially for dudes like Ahor, old. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1682.0s)]
*  Like I want to see old dudes go there and fuck people up. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1684.0s)]
*  And Glover is just so, and the thing that happened with Glover too is his relationship with Alex Pahara. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1688.0s)]
*  Oh, he's only 30? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1694.0s)]
*  Yuri's only 30, Jesus Christ. That guy's so talented, man. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1695.0s)]
*  He's super creative. Super weird to watch. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1698.0s)]
*  But I think what happened was Glover training with Alex, the two of them tightened each other's games up really substantially. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1702.0s)]
*  You saw like a big leap in Glover once he started training with Alex. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1709.0s)]
*  And he was like, hey, I'm in the ring with this fucking killer man. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1714.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what happens when you train with fucking killers. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1718.0s)]
*  You got to, especially at this level. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1721.0s)]
*  If you're just training with fucking turds, give me a fucking turd. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1723.0s)]
*  Yeah, there seems to be a real benefit to the struggle of training with someone who could fucking kill you on a regular basis. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1728.0s)]
*  You either sink or swim, but if you do swim, those guys who do swim, think about those camps that have a ton of killers. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1734.0s)]
*  That just like everybody thrives off of everybody. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1743.0s)]
*  You got to just like not destroy each other in training and you can all get through it better. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1746.0s)]
*  Yeah, the sparring. I mean, that's just can change someone's career. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1751.0s)]
*  Just how hard you spar. I haven't sparred. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1756.0s)]
*  I sparred in camp like that last fight I sparred I think nine weeks out up to the fight. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1759.0s)]
*  And then are you careful with training partners? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1764.0s)]
*  Do you have like guys that you know that you could spar with that you'll like legitimately spar and not turn into a fight? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1766.0s)]
*  Mario Batista. I know he just fucking smoked that one dude, Benito Lopez. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1772.0s)]
*  I've been training with Mario for probably the last seven, eight years. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1778.0s)]
*  We were both amateurs at the MMA lab. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1782.0s)]
*  He's one where I feel like we're all every time he's so good at mimicking whoever I'm fighting or he's such a good training partner that it never really turns into like an ego match. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1784.0s)]
*  Then there's a bunch of guys at the MMA lab that are killers, up and comers. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1794.0s)]
*  But sparring, we turn it up. We do got to we got to go hard. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1798.0s)]
*  I want that feel, but I also want them to know, hey, if I do get hit, if you rock me at all, don't try to take me out. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1801.0s)]
*  I want, you know, this is this is sparring. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1808.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not getting paid. You're not getting paid. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1811.0s)]
*  Let's let's take care of each other. So I always try to take care of my partners, too. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1813.0s)]
*  I don't want to. The last thing I want to do is fucking knock one of my partners out. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1816.0s)]
*  I've dropped my partners. I feel this. I feel so bad because I know how concussions can change people's careers, change their lives outside of fighting. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1820.0s)]
*  So my main focus is not knocking my partner out. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1828.0s)]
*  And I want them to be the same way while turning it up, because I do want to get a good, good fucking look for guys like Peter. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1833.0s)]
*  Like I wanted guys to come after me. I knew that motherfucker was going to come after me. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1840.0s)]
*  So I wanted my partners to not be like like timid. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1843.0s)]
*  And sometimes it's hard to find training partners that are going to come after me and not be like scared a little bit. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1846.0s)]
*  Yeah, one of the things that I learned from watching fights like this is important is that when I watch fights at home, when I just watch them, I don't sometimes know who really won because I'm not totally paying attention. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1852.0s)]
*  Maybe I get a text message from my friend. Maybe I'm talking to my kid. Maybe the dog comes in the room. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1868.0s)]
*  Like maybe I don't know. Like when you watch fights with a group of friends and you're all laughing and talking shit, you barely know what the fuck is going on. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1873.0s)]
*  Yeah, which leads me to your your last fight, because after that fight, there was a bunch of people that were saying that was a bad decision. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1880.0s)]
*  Pewter, you should have got it. And I remember being in my green room. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1887.0s)]
*  I just did a show in London and we're eating steaks and we're all talking and watching the fight. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1892.0s)]
*  Did you think he won? Like, I don't know. I'm like, I'm going to have to watch that one again. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1896.0s)]
*  I'm like, didn't they look like Pewter took them down a bunch? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1900.0s)]
*  So there's a perception. And I think some of that perception comes from takedowns. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1903.0s)]
*  Yeah. So then I go back and I just watch it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1908.0s)]
*  I just watched the fight with no one in the room but me. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1912.0s)]
*  And when I was at the gym and I was like, no, that's a that's not a bad decision. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1915.0s)]
*  You know, there was one round to you in the beginning, second round to Jan, third round to you. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1919.0s)]
*  If you look at damage done, you look at overall strikes and impact, you landed more. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1925.0s)]
*  He definitely took you down. Yeah. But how much was done with that? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1932.0s)]
*  That's the thing. It's like, what does that count for? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1936.0s)]
*  Like, it's a I know there's there's a sort of subjective element to how that gets regarded and what what's good and what's bad. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1939.0s)]
*  But that was not a bad decision. It was a very fucking close fight, a very good fight. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1947.0s)]
*  But I felt like for you, that was going to be that fight where we'll see. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1953.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we'll see how you hang with the cream of the crop, because that guy's the best. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1957.0s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. All the people that were saying no, a lot of people are saying was a robbery were the same people going into that fight saying I was going to get smoked. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1961.0s)]
*  So they fucking hated the fact that I was even close. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1968.0s)]
*  So yeah, I rewatched the fight a bunch. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1971.0s)]
*  First round, I feel like was the round that was controversial. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1974.0s)]
*  Some people were saying it should have been 30, 27, Jan. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1978.0s)]
*  And those guys are just fucking haters. Those guys are because the third round is clearly mine. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1980.0s)]
*  I cut him bad and hurt him. The second round he won. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1984.0s)]
*  But I did drop him. Technically, I dropped him. He cracked me. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1987.0s)]
*  Didn't drop me. But he did more damage on the second round. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1990.0s)]
*  The first round was the one that was the most like up in the air. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1993.0s)]
*  And when he took me down, I was throwing up all my plotters, triangles, arm bars. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=1996.0s)]
*  They weren't necessarily close. They weren't close to somebody. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2000.0s)]
*  But he was having to react. He was having to do the defenses to where he wasn't able to strike me, which led me to being able to get up. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2003.0s)]
*  So and then when I did get up, I was landing clearly landing the better shots. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2010.0s)]
*  But yeah, a lot of people, they just hated the fact that I skipped the entire top 10, which the top dog. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2014.0s)]
*  And, you know, I got to answer a lot of those questions about, you know, cardio. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2022.0s)]
*  Can I even grapple? Because I hadn't really grappled yet in the UFC. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2027.0s)]
*  Do I have that dog in me? Do I have heart? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2031.0s)]
*  Which I mean, I felt like I showed that when I broke my foot in the Andre Sacrement fight five years ago. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2034.0s)]
*  I was fighting with one foot and like, you know, people don't remember those those moments. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2040.0s)]
*  But yeah, I feel like I got to show a lot in that fight. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2044.0s)]
*  Yeah, you definitely did. Yeah. But fuck all those people. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2047.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't bother me. It doesn't. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2050.0s)]
*  Like we talk about it like I talk about it on the podcast and stuff. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2054.0s)]
*  I do talk about it because it's, you know, it's being talked about. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2057.0s)]
*  Well, it's your you're a flamboyant personality. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2061.0s)]
*  You talk a lot of shit. Yeah. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2064.0s)]
*  So when people talk a lot of shit, it gets a lot of people to pay attention to them, which is great. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2066.0s)]
*  But it also gets a bunch of haters hoping that you get beat up. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2070.0s)]
*  That's Floyd's whole way of he made his whole career. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2074.0s)]
*  Connor, I mean, everyone fucking want to see him lose. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2076.0s)]
*  I mean, eventually I'm going to be making them pay per view points. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2079.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if people are going to buy to pay me or pay to see me get knocked out. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2082.0s)]
*  Floyd's a great master at it. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2086.0s)]
*  Floyd went from being like a real exciting pressure fighter and he had a bunch of hand problems to like money mayweather start talking shit, just boxing people's faces off. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2088.0s)]
*  No more hand problems, much more money. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2099.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love what he's doing to beat up these YouTube guys. I love it. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2101.0s)]
*  It's so funny that these guys are willing to get beat up by him. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2105.0s)]
*  Well, I think they're all delusional. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2109.0s)]
*  Most of them, I mean, yeah, they really think I mean, I could land it. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2111.0s)]
*  I can land the shot. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2116.0s)]
*  Isn't that hilarious? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2117.0s)]
*  If you're not a, yeah, it's fucking weird. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2118.0s)]
*  I love what he's doing though. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2120.0s)]
*  I mean, I didn't watch his last one. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2121.0s)]
*  I watched the one with Logan was the only one I really watched. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2123.0s)]
*  The Logan one was insane. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2126.0s)]
*  Logan, I bet Floyd was in there like, what the fuck? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2128.0s)]
*  I didn't realize this motherfucker was that big. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2131.0s)]
*  He's so big. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2133.0s)]
*  He's so big. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2134.0s)]
*  He's so big. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2135.0s)]
*  And athletic. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2136.0s)]
*  He's very athletic. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2137.0s)]
*  And when he was like swinging wild at Floyd, I was like, if one of these gets through, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2138.0s)]
*  that's a big old Viking fella. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2143.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2145.0s)]
*  That was, I don't know. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2146.0s)]
*  I was sitting on the edge of my seat. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2147.0s)]
*  That was probably, I like what Jake's fights too. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2148.0s)]
*  I'll watch those, but it's pretty much the only boxing I watched. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2151.0s)]
*  Like Logan or Jake's fighting or. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2154.0s)]
*  Bro, he dropped Anderson Silva. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2156.0s)]
*  That was front row for that. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2158.0s)]
*  He dropped Anderson Silva. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2159.0s)]
*  No matter what anybody says. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2161.0s)]
*  Jake Paul dropped Anderson Silva. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2162.0s)]
*  You got to stop with all this. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2163.0s)]
*  He's just a YouTuber. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2165.0s)]
*  He had a boxing match with Anderson Silva. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2166.0s)]
*  He won a unanimous decision and he dropped him. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2168.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2170.0s)]
*  It was entertaining. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2171.0s)]
*  The conversation's over. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2172.0s)]
*  It was fucking entertaining too. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2173.0s)]
*  Very entertaining. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2174.0s)]
*  It was a good fight. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2175.0s)]
*  Great boxing match. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2176.0s)]
*  I submit, and I have before, that if that guy wasn't Jake Paul from YouTube and he was just [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2177.0s)]
*  an up and coming undefeated boxer who's been knocking out MMA fighters, you would go, wow, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2179.8s)]
*  this kid is fucking awesome. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2185.8s)]
*  You would say, look at this up and coming boxer who's tricked these MMA guys into boxing [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2187.8s)]
*  with him. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2192.8s)]
*  He's knocking them all out. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2193.8s)]
*  Ben Askren knocked out Tyron Woodley with one punch. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2194.8s)]
*  Anybody that doesn't think he's legit after that, you're delusional. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2198.8s)]
*  You're delusional. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2202.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2203.04s)]
*  But he's doing it too. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2204.04s)]
*  He's getting people to hate him. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2205.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2206.04s)]
*  I'm so curious. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2207.04s)]
*  I'm glad they're doing it. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2208.04s)]
*  I fucking love it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2209.04s)]
*  I'm so curious what's next for Jake Paul. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2210.04s)]
*  I love to wait for the anticipation. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2211.04s)]
*  I know that Nate Diaz thing's kind of looming there. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2213.8s)]
*  Imagine if he wins a world title. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2217.6000000000004s)]
*  What if he does this for five or six more years and wins a world title? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2219.98s)]
*  He's clearly improving fast too from that last fight to the Anderson Silva fight. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2223.88s)]
*  Improved a lot. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2229.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2230.44s)]
*  He went through a full fight camp. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2231.44s)]
*  He's supposed to fight that Top Rahman Jr. fucking whatever the guy's name was. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2232.44s)]
*  He's supposed to fight him going through fight camps. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2235.12s)]
*  Top Rahman Jr.? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2236.76s)]
*  I don't remember his name. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2237.76s)]
*  Top Rahman. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2238.76s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2239.76s)]
*  Rockman? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2240.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2241.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2242.76s)]
*  I see him Rockman's son. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2243.76s)]
*  I don't know where that Top Rahman from. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2244.76s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2245.76s)]
*  He improved a lot from going into that fight camp. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2247.6000000000004s)]
*  Supposed to fight that guy. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2252.6000000000004s)]
*  Did it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2253.6000000000004s)]
*  But you could tell. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2254.6000000000004s)]
*  Dude's in the gym. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2255.6000000000004s)]
*  He's training. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2256.6000000000004s)]
*  He's doing big things. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2257.6000000000004s)]
*  So yeah, I'm excited to see what's next for him. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2258.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2262.28s)]
*  It's interesting because he's kind of sort of taken over the sport of boxing in a way. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2264.4s)]
*  He gets as much attention and as much press as any of these world ... Ryan Davis just [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2268.5600000000004s)]
*  signed on to fight ... Gervonta Davis just signed on to fight Ryan Garcia. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2275.28s)]
*  That is official. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2279.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2280.6800000000003s)]
*  Is it? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2281.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2282.6800000000003s)]
*  That's happening in February. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2283.6800000000003s)]
*  That's a big fight. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2284.6800000000003s)]
*  I'll tune into that one. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2285.6800000000003s)]
*  But how come we didn't get Errol Spence versus Terrence Crawford? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2286.6800000000003s)]
*  Why didn't we get that fight? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2289.1600000000003s)]
*  That was supposed to happen. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2291.04s)]
*  That was in negotiation. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2292.04s)]
*  With boxing, there's certain fights that just don't get made. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2294.28s)]
*  And it's so frustrating. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2298.32s)]
*  Is it different organizations having to own those different fighters and shit? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2299.32s)]
*  I guess it's probably a factor. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2303.8s)]
*  Different promoters, it's probably a factor. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2306.36s)]
*  But it's also like I think fighters probably want the best deal for themselves and they're [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2308.42s)]
*  holding out negotiations. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2312.52s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2315.0s)]
*  But it's just like that was one where I was like, damn. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2316.0s)]
*  How did we not get that fight? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2320.44s)]
*  That was a great fight. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2322.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a who knows who wins fight. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2324.36s)]
*  Those are the ones you want. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2325.76s)]
*  How old are they? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2329.48s)]
*  They're still ... [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2330.48s)]
*  I think Terrence Crawford is older. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2331.48s)]
*  I think he's in his 30s. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2332.88s)]
*  He might be 34. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2334.44s)]
*  Like a Floyd Manny thing where he'd get it too late. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2335.44s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2338.6400000000003s)]
*  You don't want that. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2339.6400000000003s)]
*  Because Crawford is like one of the best switch hitters of all time. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2340.6400000000003s)]
*  He's a fucking wizard in there. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2344.2400000000002s)]
*  God, and I'm not even very familiar with those guys. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2346.0s)]
*  I've heard of their names, but I'm not familiar with them. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2348.1200000000003s)]
*  So you don't watch boxing? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2349.8s)]
*  No. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2350.8s)]
*  I watch Logan and Jake boxing. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2351.8s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2353.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2354.4s)]
*  He's 35. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2355.4s)]
*  35? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2356.4s)]
*  Yeah, see, that's getting a little ... [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2357.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting a little ... [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2358.4s)]
*  Getting up there. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2359.4s)]
*  It's getting up there. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2360.4s)]
*  But ... [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2361.4s)]
*  I wanted to ask you what you think about the power slapping too. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2362.96s)]
*  I know ... When I was thinking about it, I was like, I'm going to probably come on here [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2365.12s)]
*  and if it gets brought up, talk just absolute shit about it because I don't fucking ... But [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2368.2400000000002s)]
*  then I sat ... I had a meeting with UFC yesterday and I sat down with Dana. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2372.32s)]
*  No cameras, nothing. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2376.2000000000003s)]
*  Just sat down and talked. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2377.2000000000003s)]
*  He was getting so fired up about the power slapping and so passionate about it that it [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2378.56s)]
*  made me almost want to watch it because he announced his thing and everything. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2384.44s)]
*  I was like ... He's like, they don't have to fucking do it because my whole thing is [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2387.88s)]
*  two concussions. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2391.24s)]
*  I don't want to fucking watch people just get ... They choose to do it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2392.24s)]
*  I'm like, well, fair point, but I just can't imagine ... Oh, God. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2395.96s)]
*  Listen, man. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2400.7599999999998s)]
*  I love Dana and I would be a hypocrite if I said I wouldn't watch this because I will [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2403.04s)]
*  watch it. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2407.96s)]
*  But this is not my cup of tea. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2411.2s)]
*  What I like is problem solving. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2413.52s)]
*  I like puzzles. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2416.08s)]
*  I like you and Jan. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2417.12s)]
*  I like this fucking Russian assassin storming the gates at you and you figure in a way to [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2418.68s)]
*  move around him and kick his legs and jab at him. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2424.04s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2428.16s)]
*  I love that fight. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2429.16s)]
*  I love that fight. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2430.3199999999997s)]
*  I love technique. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2431.3199999999997s)]
*  It was sad to watch Frankie Edgar get knocked out this weekend. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2432.8799999999997s)]
*  It was sad. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2436.48s)]
*  But God damn Chris Gutierrez is good. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2437.48s)]
*  Yeah, slick. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2440.2799999999997s)]
*  God damn, he's slick. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2441.2799999999997s)]
*  The way he moves is so nice. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2445.0s)]
*  Yeah, I watched that. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  His footwork. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2448.6800000000003s)]
*  It was very good. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2449.6800000000003s)]
*  He has a similar style to mine as far as dancing up against a cage and throw similar shots. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2450.6800000000003s)]
*  I think we probably have similar builds, but yeah, I did not like that fight for Frankie. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2455.52s)]
*  I did not like it either. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2459.88s)]
*  I'm not allowed to bet on fights now, that whole new thing. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2460.88s)]
*  What is that? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2463.28s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2464.28s)]
*  I don't have any insider information. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2465.28s)]
*  I want a guy like you who bets his whole fucking purse on winning. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2466.52s)]
*  Yeah, I bet on yourself. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2470.04s)]
*  Come on. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2471.52s)]
*  Yes, why? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2472.52s)]
*  So weird. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2473.52s)]
*  Why can't a UFC fight? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2474.52s)]
*  It's bad optics, they say. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2475.68s)]
*  I would have bet Frankie. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2477.2s)]
*  I looked at Chris Gutierrez and I look at Frankie and I'm like, Chris is going to probably [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2479.8s)]
*  knock him out. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2483.84s)]
*  Like, Frankie, that's what I was thinking and I would have put money on it. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2484.84s)]
*  These kids were in the crowd for the first time. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2488.04s)]
*  And they panned to him in the beginning of the fight. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2489.64s)]
*  I'm like, that was their first time. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2491.44s)]
*  Yes, the first time seeing him fight live. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2493.44s)]
*  And it's the end because it's his last fight. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2496.24s)]
*  Yeah, that fucking hurts. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2498.24s)]
*  Look, the guy is a fucking warrior. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2499.24s)]
*  You can't tell him don't do that. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2500.88s)]
*  Well, as far as matchups go, Gutierrez is one of those guys that everybody who watches [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2503.9199999999996s)]
*  fights knows he's fucking dangerous, like a top level. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2508.68s)]
*  But he doesn't have the shine yet, for whatever reason. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2512.8399999999997s)]
*  Maybe this fight will change that. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2516.56s)]
*  Obviously, it's going to change it for everybody who remembers. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2517.9599999999996s)]
*  But it's like there's so many fights and so many KOs. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2520.6s)]
*  In that card, 15 fights, I think we had the most first round stoppages ever. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2522.72s)]
*  Like seven or eight. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2527.56s)]
*  It was nuts. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2528.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2529.56s)]
*  And fucking Ryan Spann. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2530.56s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2531.56s)]
*  A jab. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2533.4s)]
*  Holy shit, is he good? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2534.4s)]
*  That's a scary dude. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2536.0s)]
*  When he said this is the first fight I trained for, like what? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2537.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's... [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2541.2s)]
*  What? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2542.2s)]
*  How old is he? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2543.2s)]
*  Jamie, we can see how old... [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2544.2s)]
*  31. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2545.2s)]
*  31? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2546.2s)]
*  Damn, you're on top of that shit. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2547.2s)]
*  Yeah, 31. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2548.2s)]
*  Dude, that guy's a nightmare. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2549.2s)]
*  That's a scary guy. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2550.2s)]
*  Is he ranked? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2551.2s)]
*  Was that a ranked one? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2552.2s)]
*  I mean, it should be now because I think Dominic Reyes was ranked. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2553.2s)]
*  I think Dominic was like five or six or something like that. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2556.84s)]
*  I think he's owned four. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2559.84s)]
*  Those last few fights were rough, dude. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2561.8799999999997s)]
*  The John Jones fight was rough, right? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2564.2799999999997s)]
*  And then he goes right from that to Urie. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2566.64s)]
*  And Urie nukes people. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2569.16s)]
*  When he kicked his body and left this giant red footprint on his body, I was like, how [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2571.24s)]
*  fucking hard does that dude hit? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2576.52s)]
*  Reyes fan number 10 now? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2578.9599999999996s)]
*  Number 10 now. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2581.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's legit, man. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2582.3199999999997s)]
*  There's just a few of those guys in that division, man. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2584.3199999999997s)]
*  Nikita Krylov, the way he took out Gustafson. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2587.9599999999996s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2590.84s)]
*  Didn't did something happen to him recently? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2592.12s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2594.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2595.68s)]
*  Why do I feel like he got injured? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2596.68s)]
*  That's a scary division right there. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2601.36s)]
*  Fucking terrifying, terrifying division. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2602.96s)]
*  They're all heavyweights. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2605.4s)]
*  Every one of them is a heavyweight. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2606.72s)]
*  Yeah, fuck that. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2607.8s)]
*  I'm so glad I'm not a big guy like Bantonweight. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2608.8s)]
*  There's still some scary guys at Bantonweight. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2611.48s)]
*  Well, you have a great frame for Bantonweight, though. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2613.28s)]
*  If you can continue to make 35, that reach is such a nice thing to have. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2615.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know Chell always says, reach advantage is not advantage unless you... [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2620.68s)]
*  I'm like, it is. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2623.96s)]
*  Reach advantage is an advantage. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2625.52s)]
*  It's an advantage. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2627.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2628.0s)]
*  Look at John Jones. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2629.0s)]
*  When you have the reach advantage and strength, John Jones has reach advantage and ridiculous [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2630.4s)]
*  strength in wrestling. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2635.88s)]
*  He's got the best combination of assets. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2637.3199999999997s)]
*  He might not have the same kind of one punch power that some of those guys have, but he [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2641.6000000000004s)]
*  fucks up everybody. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2647.0800000000004s)]
*  Distance management is the best ever. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2649.6000000000004s)]
*  In that division, he's so good at just keeping right away, stabbing at your legs, the elliptical [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2651.36s)]
*  kick or the... [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2657.0s)]
*  Oblique. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2658.0s)]
*  Oblique kick and then the side kick to the knee. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2659.0s)]
*  I love that one. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2661.96s)]
*  Elliptical kick. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2662.96s)]
*  Where's my brain? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2663.96s)]
*  Weed stole that word from me. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2664.96s)]
*  Elliptical kick. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2666.96s)]
*  Gus is out for his next fight, if that's what you were thinking. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2668.36s)]
*  Oh, that's what it was. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2670.56s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2671.56s)]
*  Yeah, because Gus was supposed to... [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2672.56s)]
*  That was going to be his rebound fight. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2674.04s)]
*  Oh, because he retired, right? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2675.7200000000003s)]
*  He was going to come back? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2677.12s)]
*  Aleksandr Gus is still going to come back? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2678.12s)]
*  Yeah, he was going to retire after that last KO because Krylov just stormed at him in the [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2679.6s)]
*  first round and took him out. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2684.7200000000003s)]
*  I couldn't believe he fought that way. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2686.04s)]
*  He generally fights pretty reserved, but in that fight, he just went do or die. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2688.2400000000002s)]
*  He's out. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2692.92s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2693.92s)]
*  He was... [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2695.4s)]
*  I remember his fight against... [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2696.4s)]
*  Was it Glover that he uppercutted? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  Or who was it? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2704.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's a no-fish... [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2705.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Glover. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2706.2000000000003s)]
*  He uppercutted Glover. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2707.2000000000003s)]
*  That was slick boxing. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2708.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2709.2000000000003s)]
*  That last 10 seconds of that slide off. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2710.2000000000003s)]
*  Video game shit. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2712.2000000000003s)]
*  Video game shit. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2713.2000000000003s)]
*  That was Gustafson and his best. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2714.2000000000003s)]
*  That and the John Jones fight. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2716.64s)]
*  I remember the John Jones fight, the first one, when John didn't train. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2717.64s)]
*  That's how you see the difference, because look at the second fight. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2723.16s)]
*  They have a second fight. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2725.08s)]
*  Did he take him down? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2726.3599999999997s)]
*  But you have to also say, the second fight, was that before or after Gustafson fought [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2727.8399999999997s)]
*  Rumble? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2734.04s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2735.04s)]
*  Rest in peace, Rumble. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2737.2799999999997s)]
*  Rumble passed away this week. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2738.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know where. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2739.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2740.2799999999997s)]
*  Apparently, he had some form of, I think it was like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or something [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2741.2799999999997s)]
*  along those lines. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2746.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2747.88s)]
*  I don't know if that's public. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2748.88s)]
*  We should find out if that's public knowledge. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2749.88s)]
*  I think it was. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2751.2799999999997s)]
*  I think I read that. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2752.44s)]
*  I couldn't pronounce the words, and that sounds like it was. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2753.44s)]
*  I shouldn't say it if it wasn't public knowledge. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2755.0s)]
*  If it's not public knowledge, we should edit it out. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2756.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm almost positive I just read that in an article the other day. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2760.48s)]
*  But yeah, that was ... I was on the ... [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2762.6400000000003s)]
*  38 years old, man. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2764.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2765.36s)]
*  I did the UFC quintet with him. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2766.36s)]
*  It was me, Clay Guida, him, Gilbert Burns, Anthony Smith. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2767.36s)]
*  But yeah, that was my only really interaction with him. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2772.2000000000003s)]
*  Fucking good, dude. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2775.28s)]
*  Yeah, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2777.48s)]
*  A rare immune disorder called HLH. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2779.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2782.64s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2783.64s)]
*  38. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2784.64s)]
*  Such a nice guy. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2785.64s)]
*  And the biggest welterweight that's ever walked the face of the planet. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2788.2s)]
*  When he was a welterweight? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2791.96s)]
*  I know. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2793.24s)]
*  That's fucked. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2794.24s)]
*  Dude, I saw him in between fights once, and I go, Anthony, how big are you? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2795.24s)]
*  And he goes, 230 pounds. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2799.0s)]
*  230? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2801.12s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2802.12s)]
*  He walked in looking like a Greek god. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2803.68s)]
*  He was so gigantic. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2807.12s)]
*  He just ripped? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2808.12s)]
*  He wasn't fat at all. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2809.2s)]
*  How do you get that little? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2811.16s)]
*  How do you make 170? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2813.04s)]
*  He was gigantic. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2814.3599999999997s)]
*  He always had issues making 170 though, right? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2815.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2817.48s)]
*  Well, he missed it a bunch of times, and then he fought Vitor at 85. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2818.48s)]
*  Brumbo was like this guy that you never knew what you were going to get. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2823.04s)]
*  If he was ready to go and in shape and prepared ... [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2828.88s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2834.56s)]
*  He could be one of the most dangerous guys of all time. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2835.7599999999998s)]
*  But he was kind of, at least early on in his career, inconsistent until he moved up in [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2840.16s)]
*  weight. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2844.44s)]
*  Then when he moved up in weight, look what he did in the light heavyweight division. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2845.44s)]
*  I maintain that most of what was holding him back was just the dread of making that weight. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2847.6s)]
*  It was just dread. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2852.7999999999997s)]
*  The guy goes up two weight classes and is knocking out everybody with one punch at light [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2854.6s)]
*  heavyweight. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2859.24s)]
*  Yeah, 170 should have never picked him. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2860.24s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2862.4s)]
*  Inside of his career, he's fighting 35 pounds up and destroying people, knocking out Glover [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2863.44s)]
*  with one punch. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2870.4s)]
*  Knocks out Gustafson. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2872.36s)]
*  Bro, he fucked everybody up except DC. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2873.36s)]
*  DC just uses wrestling. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2876.44s)]
*  He fought DC twice, right? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2878.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2879.8s)]
*  God, I bet DC was like, God damn it, I don't want to fight this motherfucker again, dude. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2880.8s)]
*  He's so dangerous. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2884.08s)]
*  Brumbo's so dangerous. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2886.08s)]
*  That's a scary ... yeah. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2887.08s)]
*  He was so dangerous. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2888.7200000000003s)]
*  He had power that was ... I remember when he hit Glover, I was like ... [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2890.4s)]
*  Did his tooth go flying? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2894.52s)]
*  Was that Glover's tooth? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2895.52s)]
*  He made somebody's tooth go flying. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2897.4s)]
*  I don't know if it was Glover's. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2899.4s)]
*  Was that uppercut? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2900.4s)]
*  God damn, he was a powerhouse. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2901.4s)]
*  Yeah, possessing that fucking power in his hands. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2903.6400000000003s)]
*  He doesn't need to be like ... [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2907.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh, it is Glover's tooth. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2908.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2909.92s)]
*  He doesn't need to really be accurate either. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2910.92s)]
*  He can hit you anywhere in the head and that's night night. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2912.32s)]
*  Bro, he could hit your shoulders and you'd be dizzy. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2914.6400000000003s)]
*  It might get knocked out. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2916.6800000000003s)]
*  It's crazy he just had that preposterous power. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2918.12s)]
*  Yeah, that ... oof. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2921.12s)]
*  Watch this uppercut. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2923.12s)]
*  Dink. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2924.12s)]
*  Oh, that was like ... [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2925.12s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2926.12s)]
*  Just like a thud. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2927.12s)]
*  That's Rumble, man. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2928.7999999999997s)]
*  That's why everybody was scared of Rumble. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2929.7999999999997s)]
*  His tooth. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2932.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2933.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2934.08s)]
*  Oh, oh. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2935.08s)]
*  He woke up. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2936.08s)]
*  Two points. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2937.08s)]
*  He woke up, didn't know what the fuck happened. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2938.08s)]
*  No one counted my takedown on Peter with two points. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2939.08s)]
*  I think that was two. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2941.36s)]
*  But it'll take them to the end of the first. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2942.36s)]
*  I think it was a takedown. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2943.84s)]
*  Did his knees go to the ground? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2944.84s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2946.24s)]
*  He gets mad when they don't give up takedowns. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2947.3999999999996s)]
*  Unless it's me. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2949.2s)]
*  Kobe Covington ... when Kobe Covington fought Kamaru, he took him down. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2950.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2955.6s)]
*  DC was like, that's two. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2956.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2957.6s)]
*  That's two. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2958.6s)]
*  You gotta give it to him. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2959.6s)]
*  It's a takedown. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2960.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2961.6s)]
*  So until Leon took him down the first round, which was fucking wild. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2962.6s)]
*  Mounted, right in the mount. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2965.2799999999997s)]
*  Wild, mounted him. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2966.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2968.24s)]
*  Yeah, no one had actually officially taken down Kamaru. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2969.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2971.7599999999998s)]
*  That fight was insane. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2972.7599999999998s)]
*  Dude, that wasn't saying anything. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2974.28s)]
*  Kamaru coming on here after and just fucking champ. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2975.28s)]
*  Pure class. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2978.44s)]
*  Humble champ. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2979.44s)]
*  Pure class. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2980.44s)]
*  Good outlook on it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2981.44s)]
*  He was winning the fight, got caught with a fucking head kick from one of the best guys [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2982.44s)]
*  in the world. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2985.8s)]
*  This is what it is. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2986.8s)]
*  That's the game you play. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2987.8s)]
*  Fuck, that was crazy. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2988.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2989.8s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2990.8s)]
*  And then Izzy losing in the fifth too. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2991.8s)]
*  Both pound for pound guys. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2992.8s)]
*  And right when it was about to happen, John Anik actually set it up. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=2995.0s)]
*  He said that he could coast here, but that's not what he's made of. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3001.68s)]
*  For Kamaru? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3008.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it was like that he could, no, I think it was like not quitting. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3009.2799999999997s)]
*  I think he was talking about Leon. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3013.3999999999996s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3014.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't want to fuck it up. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3017.24s)]
*  I already fucked it up. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3018.24s)]
*  But it was like, there was a quote that he said right before Leon knocked him out. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3019.24s)]
*  It was like he was kind of setting up that Leon's not going to quit. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3025.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, prophetic call and the greatest knockout call in UFC history. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3028.96s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3032.0s)]
*  We'll hear it here. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3033.4s)]
*  John Anik's the best of all time. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3035.0s)]
*  He's so fucking good. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3036.2000000000003s)]
*  Minute 12. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3037.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3038.2000000000003s)]
*  Low kick, setting it up already. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3039.2000000000003s)]
*  Throws that little low kick. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3040.2000000000003s)]
*  You see how he's fainting that left leg, trying to get a reaction out of him. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3041.2000000000003s)]
*  Nothing, no reaction. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3042.2000000000003s)]
*  That is not the claw from which he was cut. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3043.2000000000003s)]
*  Bam. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3044.2000000000003s)]
*  And then the knockout. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3045.2000000000003s)]
*  It's the perfect call. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3046.2000000000003s)]
*  It's the greatest call ever. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3047.2s)]
*  That was so beautiful. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3048.2s)]
*  But that is not the claw from which he is cut and then a perfect head kick. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3049.2s)]
*  Bro, that's Shakespeare. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3052.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's beautiful. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3053.2s)]
*  That's Shakespeare. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3054.2s)]
*  That is fucking, that's goose bumps. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3055.2s)]
*  John Anik is the fucking man. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3056.2s)]
*  That gave me goose bumps. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3057.2s)]
*  The clock. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3058.2s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3059.2s)]
*  It's the greatest call. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3060.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3061.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3062.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3063.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3064.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3065.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3066.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3067.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3068.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3069.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3070.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3071.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3072.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3073.2s)]
*  That's the greatest call. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3074.2s)]
*  It's the greatest call of all time. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3076.2s)]
*  It's the greatest call of all time. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3078.2s)]
*  Yeah, John Anik is a legend, dude. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3080.2s)]
*  But that's the greatest call of all time, right there. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3082.2s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't get any better. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3085.2s)]
*  Every now and then, the words and the moment line up and you're like, that's the greatest call. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3087.2s)]
*  That's goose bumps. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3091.2s)]
*  One of the wildest head kick knockouts, I think the most important head kick knockout ever. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3092.2s)]
*  Ever. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3096.2s)]
*  Ever. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3097.2s)]
*  Yeah, it has to be. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3098.2s)]
*  And the most shocking, where he just lands it with a minute to go in the fight, where [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3099.2s)]
*  he's clearly losing. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3104.2s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3105.2s)]
*  And there's this pound for pound head shot, dead. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3106.2s)]
*  I was like, oh shit. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3108.2s)]
*  It was crazy too, because that was in Utah at elevation. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3111.2s)]
*  Kamaru trains in Denver at elevation. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3114.2s)]
*  And Leon, to go five rounds, was getting grappled. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3116.2s)]
*  And to be able to pull that off smooth still was so fucking impressive. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3120.2s)]
*  He's so technical, man. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3125.2s)]
*  His feet, he's so good. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3126.2s)]
*  There's some video of him hitting the pads and it makes you want a quick karate. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3128.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3132.2s)]
*  Watch this motherfucker hit the pads. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3133.2s)]
*  You can find Leon Edwards hitting the pads. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3135.2s)]
*  I've never seen him do the elbows and shit. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3138.2s)]
*  Dude, he's so smooth and powerful, man. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3140.2s)]
*  Yeah, I still... [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3143.2s)]
*  Give me some volume on this. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3144.2s)]
*  He's a big guy too. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3146.2s)]
*  Bro, that is fucking clean. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3153.2s)]
*  Speed and power mixed right there. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3155.2s)]
*  Clean technique too. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3157.2s)]
*  It's like total efficiency in the way he's delivering that kick. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3159.2s)]
*  Every move as he steps in with those elbows. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3163.2s)]
*  That's going to be a massive rematch. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3169.2s)]
*  Is that the one that's in... [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3172.2s)]
*  No, that's in London. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3174.2s)]
*  And what Leon loves too is that he did all of this out of his gym in England. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3175.2s)]
*  He didn't have to move to America and join ATT or join one of the big gyms. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3182.2s)]
*  He did it out of his town. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3188.2s)]
*  That's fucking impressive. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3191.2s)]
*  I couldn't have done that in Montana. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3193.2s)]
*  I couldn't have done that in Montana. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3195.2s)]
*  But look at this. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3198.2s)]
*  Some guys that could pull that off somehow or another. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3199.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's impressive. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3202.2s)]
*  But sometimes you just got to fucking leave. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3204.2s)]
*  So those kids listening to this right now at a shitty gym, you got to leave. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3206.2s)]
*  Sometimes you have to leave. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3209.2s)]
*  Pretty much everyone. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3211.2s)]
*  Like John Jones had to leave. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3212.2s)]
*  A lot of guys have stories. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3213.2s)]
*  They leave. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3215.2s)]
*  Joaquin Buckley was here last week. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3217.2s)]
*  He said he had to leave too. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3219.2s)]
*  He had an original gym he started out with. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3221.2s)]
*  He's like, okay. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3223.2s)]
*  You can only get so good if someone's like a coach is only at a certain level. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3224.2s)]
*  And the training partners and stuff. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3228.2s)]
*  So yeah, go and do a big gym. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3231.2s)]
*  Maybe not a big gym, but just a gym with some good, some decent coaches. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3233.2s)]
*  But yeah, for the most part, you got to look for something better. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3238.2s)]
*  Do you think that there's any benefit to having a smaller environment [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3242.2s)]
*  where the coaches are really paying attention to you versus a large environment [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3248.2s)]
*  where you're at like an ATT or something like that, like hundreds of fighters, right? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3253.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3257.2s)]
*  Like where you kind of get lost in the mix. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3258.2s)]
*  Dude, my last probably four or five years, like I do all my sparring at the MMA lab. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3260.2s)]
*  They have a fucking great team over there. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3264.2s)]
*  Like they have a great schedule. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3266.2s)]
*  Their Monday through Saturday schedule is great. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3268.2s)]
*  But for me, once I started getting into the UFC, I was like, I need that one-on-one. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3271.2s)]
*  I need my own, my personal strength conditioning coach, Brandon Harris. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3277.2s)]
*  I need my own guy. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3280.2s)]
*  Jiu-jitsu coach Augusto Mendez, 180cc in 2019 in my weight class, best grappler in the world. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3282.2s)]
*  And then Tim's the kind of the head coach, holds me, sets up the sparring. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3289.2s)]
*  So I still go to the lab to spar, but I do, I bounce around and I have, it's have my, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3293.2s)]
*  it's more of a boxing approach. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3298.2s)]
*  It's like, you got the whole team dialed in, focused on me. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3299.2s)]
*  And I needed that. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3303.2s)]
*  Just like your mindset, right? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3304.2s)]
*  Like all these things improve with time, right? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3305.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3307.2s)]
*  And now you've really got it totally dialed in. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3308.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3310.2s)]
*  It's crazy to think about all the things that worked out, like how I met Tim, then I moved to Arizona, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3311.2s)]
*  then I meet Brandon Harris for the strength and conditioning, and that completely changed my career. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3315.2s)]
*  I wasn't lifting, and if I was lifting, I wasn't lifting properly. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3321.2s)]
*  And it's not even lifting to just get super strong, but just to not get injured, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3324.2s)]
*  just building that muscle around those joints and just built this, not, I haven't gotten seriously injured [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3327.2s)]
*  since I started working with Brandon. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3333.2s)]
*  And I think that's a huge reason why, just from lifting, lifting correctly. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3335.2s)]
*  So meeting him. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3339.2s)]
*  What kind of exercises does he have you doing? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3340.2s)]
*  It's not like, the nice thing about it is I don't have to think about it. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3343.2s)]
*  I know I go in there and I just put all my trust in him. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3351.2s)]
*  Here's my, here's my, here's my strength. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3353.2s)]
*  And most of the conditioning is the sparring, is the mitts, is the grappling. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3355.2s)]
*  And then I do like treadmill sprints and shit too. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3360.2s)]
*  But the thing with him is I don't go in there and his main goal isn't to just fuck me up. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3362.2s)]
*  It's not make me sore. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3366.2s)]
*  It's not, he does what I'm not getting in the gym. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3367.2s)]
*  So we'll do some stuff with like lower heart rate stuff. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3373.2s)]
*  And I know you had someone on here talking about how important that is just for longevity, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3377.2s)]
*  but just for getting in shape too, having like the zone two workouts for 45 minutes and stuff like that. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3382.2s)]
*  But as far as lifting, we'll do the deadlifts and the bench press and we'll do normal lifts. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3389.2s)]
*  Just in perfect technique. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3397.2s)]
*  I'm not hurting my back. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3399.2s)]
*  I'm not trying to lift way too much. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3400.2s)]
*  Are you doing like deadlifts, squats, a clean press? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3403.2s)]
*  We don't really do squats, no clean press. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3406.2s)]
*  Deadlifts. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3408.2s)]
*  We'll do, I fucking feel like an idiot thinking about what lifts we do right now. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3411.2s)]
*  So you're doing, but is his approach like higher repetitions with lighter weight? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3415.2s)]
*  Depending on where we're at in camp, it changes from, we'll do like four weeks of this, four weeks of this, four weeks of this. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3420.2s)]
*  And like further out we'll do power. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3429.2s)]
*  I'm really building that strength, especially like I'm going to go fight a guy like Aljo or Henry. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3431.2s)]
*  Like I'm going to be fucking grappling. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3435.2s)]
*  I need to be strong. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3436.2s)]
*  I need to be able to deadlift and jack up some underhooks and be able to, so we're going to focus on, it depends. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3437.2s)]
*  Like when I was fighting Peter, I didn't really plan on grappling too much. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3444.2s)]
*  I was planning on being way faster on my feet, not really lifting as much, being a little bit lighter. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3447.2s)]
*  So it depends on who we're fighting. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3452.2s)]
*  I'm going to fight one of these guys next and I want to be strong. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3454.2s)]
*  I want to make sure we're hitting those deadlifts and being really fucking strong. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3457.2s)]
*  So yeah, it depends. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3462.2s)]
*  And if we do like a 12 week fight camp, the first four weeks will be whatever and then the next four weeks and then the next four weeks. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3464.2s)]
*  Like I don't even really pay attention. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3470.2s)]
*  I just go in, trust him, do it and fucking yeah. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3472.2s)]
*  Do you anticipate that Henry is going to jump back into the mix? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3476.2s)]
*  Is that, you think that's real? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3480.2s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3482.2s)]
*  I've been saying no for a long time, but I do think, you know, the closer it gets, I think he is. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3483.2s)]
*  I think he's going to come back. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3489.2s)]
*  I know he's two time world champ, Olympic gold medalist. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3490.2s)]
*  If he's going to come back, he's got to come back soon. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3494.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3496.2s)]
*  Like what is he now? 35 maybe? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3497.2s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3498.2s)]
*  How old is Henry Saouda? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3500.2s)]
*  What age is he? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3502.2s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3504.2s)]
*  He's 35? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3505.2s)]
*  He's 36 in like two months. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3506.2s)]
*  Oh wow, he's got to now. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3507.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's got to now. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3509.2s)]
*  At that age, in that weight class, it gets tough. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3510.2s)]
*  There's some outliers, right? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3512.2s)]
*  Like Mighty Mouse seems to be an outlier. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3514.2s)]
*  He's as good as he's ever been. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3516.2s)]
*  He's wild. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3517.2s)]
*  You know, I've been watching him over in one, F.C. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3518.2s)]
*  I watched that last night. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3521.2s)]
*  He's as good as he's ever been. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3522.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3523.2s)]
*  He's a wizard. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3524.2s)]
*  But Henry versus Aljo, I think is, if I had to guess, if that's going to happen, it's going to happen early next year. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3525.2s)]
*  I wonder if that, how much do you think Suhudo is super talented? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3532.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3538.2s)]
*  Obviously, two division world champion. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3539.2s)]
*  But how much does that sell? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3542.2s)]
*  Is that a big fight? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3544.2s)]
*  For Aljo or me? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3546.2s)]
*  For anybody. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3547.2s)]
*  It should be, but it's not because it's Henry. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3549.2s)]
*  And for whatever reason, some people are fucking likeable. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3552.2s)]
*  Some people are, you know, superstars. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3555.2s)]
*  And he's just not, I mean, it's not, I'm not acting like I'm talking shit. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3557.2s)]
*  He's just really not a superstar. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3561.2s)]
*  He's a two time world champion. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3563.2s)]
*  He's got like less than a million followers on Instagram, which is crazy. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3564.2s)]
*  Two time world champ. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3567.2s)]
*  That's like, that was Connor's whole thing. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3569.2s)]
*  That's why he was so fucking massive. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3571.2s)]
*  I'm not saying this is a diss. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3573.2s)]
*  I'm a Henry Suhudo fan because I never understood why Mighty Mouse didn't get famous. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3574.2s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3577.2s)]
*  I never met a fucking Henry Suhudo fan. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3578.2s)]
*  I'm a fan of the way he fights. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3579.2s)]
*  He's very skilled. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3581.2s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3582.2s)]
*  The way he took out Dominic. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3583.2s)]
*  Very skilled. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3584.2s)]
*  He's a fucking animal, dude. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3585.2s)]
*  The way he took out TJ. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3586.2s)]
*  Henry Suhudo's a beast. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3587.2s)]
*  He is a beast. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3588.2s)]
*  He's a beast. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3589.2s)]
*  I know he talks a lot of shit, but. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3590.2s)]
*  And it's not good shit. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3592.2s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3593.2s)]
*  You can talk shit as long as it's good. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3594.2s)]
*  But him versus Aljo. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3596.2s)]
*  Is that thing, here, if you do like this, it'll tighten it up. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3597.2s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3600.2s)]
*  This button right here. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3601.2s)]
*  It's wiggling around. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3602.2s)]
*  That's why you're having a problem with it down here. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3603.2s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3605.2s)]
*  Henry versus Aljo. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3606.2s)]
*  I think it's a pretty big fight, though. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3607.2s)]
*  It's a very big fight. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3609.2s)]
*  It's not going to do crazy numbers. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3610.2s)]
*  It's not going to be a main event. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3611.2s)]
*  If I had to guess, it would be a Cobain. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3613.2s)]
*  But it's a difficult fight, and it might not be a big fight. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3615.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3619.2s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3620.2s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3621.2s)]
*  It's kind of crazy because you could lose to Henry. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3622.2s)]
*  Henry's a monster wrestler. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3624.2s)]
*  Aljo's strength is, you know, he's clearly well-rounded, but his strength is his grappling. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3626.2s)]
*  God. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3631.2s)]
*  See, it's an interesting fight. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3632.2s)]
*  Very, very, very, very. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3633.2s)]
*  Yeah, I bet me versus Aljo would be a main event. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3635.2s)]
*  I think Henry versus Aljo would be a Cobain event on a card. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3638.2s)]
*  Shots fired. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3641.2s)]
*  Shots fired. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3642.2s)]
*  I think that's just... [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3643.2s)]
*  He's going to have a crown on in his next video on Instagram. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3645.2s)]
*  He's going to be talking shit about you. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3647.2s)]
*  Yeah, 75 likes. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3649.2s)]
*  I've looked at his Instagram. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3651.2s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3652.2s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3653.2s)]
*  How does he have this less of likes? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3654.2s)]
*  It's unfortunate that people don't appreciate what he's accomplished. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3656.2s)]
*  It's like the flyweight class just never got the shine. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3659.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it still doesn't really... [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3662.2s)]
*  Still doesn't get the shine. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3664.2s)]
*  Brandon Marino and Davidson Figueroa 03 is going to be fucking insane. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3665.2s)]
*  Four. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3668.2s)]
*  That's right. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3669.2s)]
*  Four. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3670.2s)]
*  That's right, four. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3671.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3672.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3673.2s)]
*  Bro, Kai Carafonte. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3674.2s)]
*  I mean, that division's filled with killers. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3675.2s)]
*  Filled with killers. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3677.2s)]
*  The reason Henry left was money. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3678.2s)]
*  He wanted more money, and the UFC wasn't going to pay him more money. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3680.2s)]
*  They're like, this is what we're going to pay you, either fight or not. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3684.2s)]
*  That's why he retired. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3687.2s)]
*  He thought retiring, they would want him back, and they just haven't. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3688.2s)]
*  Now he's this old, and he's like, well, fuck. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3692.2s)]
*  Okay, I'll come back. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3695.2s)]
*  Well, I think he's still a competitor, too. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3696.2s)]
*  We could be cynical about it all day long, but that guy is an Olympic gold medalist and [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3698.2s)]
*  two-division UFC champion. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3704.2s)]
*  Considerably the number one combat. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3706.2s)]
*  I saw someone say Alex Pajero is the number one combat sports athlete, but it's hard to [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3709.2s)]
*  put him above Henry when he's won the Olympic gold. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3713.2s)]
*  Yeah, he won the gold medal in the Olympics. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3715.2s)]
*  However, Pajero, when he's fighting in glory, he's fighting elite professionals. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3716.2s)]
*  You know, where Henry is wrestling amateurs. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3724.2s)]
*  I wonder if they had a professional level of grappling, if the level would be even better [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3728.2s)]
*  than it is right now. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3734.2s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3736.2s)]
*  If there was millions of dollars to be made. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3737.2s)]
*  If wrestling was like NBA, it was that big, which is totally conceivable. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3739.2s)]
*  Wrestling is fucking exciting. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3745.2s)]
*  You watch two assassins go after each other and dive on legs and scrambles. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3747.2s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3751.2s)]
*  Why isn't that a huge thing? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3753.2s)]
*  And if it was a huge thing and these guys could make millions, I wonder if the level [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3754.2s)]
*  would go up. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3759.2s)]
*  Yeah, I would assume so. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3760.2s)]
*  Because think about how high the level is already. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3761.2s)]
*  But if it was like a real professional sport all around the world. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3764.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3769.2s)]
*  Probably. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3771.2s)]
*  I'm sure money makes people happy. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3772.2s)]
*  It makes them want to fucking go after it. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3775.2s)]
*  So yeah, probably. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3777.2s)]
*  Well, it does, but that makes wrestling even more impressive. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3778.2s)]
*  Because other than guys like Jordan Burrows, who makes a considerable amount of money doing [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3781.2s)]
*  events and competing, he makes money. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3786.2s)]
*  But for most guys, it's a fucking tough road to be a wrestler. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3789.2s)]
*  You might get a coaching job. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3794.2s)]
*  But if you get a coaching job, that was what kept... [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3796.2s)]
*  That was Mark Schultz. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3800.2s)]
*  Mark Schultz, who was the brother of the guy who got murdered by John DuPont in that movie. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3803.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3809.2s)]
*  What was that movie called again? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3810.2s)]
*  Fox. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3811.2s)]
*  Foxcatcher. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3812.2s)]
*  Foxcatcher. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3813.2s)]
*  The movie's kind of like... [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3814.2s)]
*  They take a lot of liberties with the storyline, like clear. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3815.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3821.2s)]
*  But in the story, in the movie, Mark Schultz fights some Russian in a cage fight. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3822.2s)]
*  But in real life, he fought Big Daddy Goodrich. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3829.2s)]
*  So Mark Schultz, who was a fucking cream of the crop, world champion wrestler, just took [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3833.2s)]
*  Big Daddy Goodrich down at will. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3838.2s)]
*  Just mounted him, beat him up, but he never fought an MMA again. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3840.2s)]
*  Because he was coaching. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3843.2s)]
*  I think he was coaching for Baylor. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3844.2s)]
*  Brigham Young, maybe Brigham. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3847.2s)]
*  He was coaching for some college. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3851.2s)]
*  And the college said, if you want to retain your job as a coach, you cannot fight in a [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3853.2s)]
*  fucking cage with bare-knuckle, headbutting people on the weekend. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3857.2s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3862.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's fair, but come on. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3863.2s)]
*  Don't show up Monday retarded. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3865.2s)]
*  That's the problem with guys who were wrestlers. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3867.2s)]
*  It's like you got to a point where you got a job, then you got to... [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3869.2s)]
*  The only real competition back then for money was MMA. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3873.2s)]
*  And there was guys that jumped in with no submission training. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3877.2s)]
*  They didn't know what they were doing. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3881.2s)]
*  Remember when Ensign Inouye tapped Royce Alger? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3883.2s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3888.2s)]
*  Hell no. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3889.2s)]
*  You don't remember that? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3890.2s)]
*  I don't even know who those guys are. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3891.2s)]
*  Dude, you don't know who Ensign is? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3892.2s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3893.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3894.2s)]
*  Ensign's a legend. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3895.2s)]
*  Ensign was one of the toughest guys that's ever lived. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3896.2s)]
*  Old school UFC? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3898.2s)]
*  Old school UFC, old school pride. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3899.2s)]
*  He fought wars in pride. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3902.2s)]
*  He had a war with Frank Shamrock. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3905.2s)]
*  This dude? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3908.2s)]
*  He was to the death. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3909.2s)]
*  Oh shit, what a name. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3910.2s)]
*  His nickname was Yamoto Damashi, which is... [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3911.2s)]
*  I don't want to fuck up the translation. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3915.2s)]
*  But I think... [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3920.2s)]
*  He's a big guy. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3921.2s)]
*  I think roughly it has something to do with fighter spirit. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3923.2s)]
*  Find out what Yamoto Damashi means. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3927.2s)]
*  What's the actual translation of it? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3929.2s)]
*  12 and 8. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3933.2s)]
*  He fought everybody, huh? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3934.2s)]
*  Or anybody? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3935.2s)]
*  What does it say? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3936.2s)]
*  Cultural values. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3939.2s)]
*  What is the definition? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3941.2s)]
*  Japanese heart-mind. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3945.2s)]
*  It's a Japanese language term for the cultural values. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3947.2s)]
*  Well, they would use it in like a warrior term, though. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3950.2s)]
*  Spirit, cultural values, as opposed to cultural values [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3956.2s)]
*  of foreign nations. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3960.2s)]
*  Spirit, Yamato spirit. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3963.2s)]
*  I wonder what those dudes were making back in the day. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3965.2s)]
*  One day, me and Eddie Bravo and this dude Cabbage. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3968.2s)]
*  Do you remember Cabbage? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3971.2s)]
*  No. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3972.2s)]
*  Cabbage was another guy who fought in the early days of the UFC. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3973.2s)]
*  One of the fucking toughest dudes who's ever lived. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3975.2s)]
*  Built like a fire hydrant. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3977.2s)]
*  Fucking Cabbage. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3978.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3979.2s)]
*  Samurai spirit or old spirit of Japan. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3980.2s)]
*  So that was what his nickname was, samurai spirit. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3984.2s)]
*  That dude would literally try to fight to the death. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3987.2s)]
*  His fights were so wild. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3990.2s)]
*  They were just fucking slugfest, like duck in his head, swinging, full blast, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3992.2s)]
*  dumping the gas tank, just emptying it out. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3997.2s)]
*  As fast as possible. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=3999.2s)]
*  He fought Igor Volchanchin, but he also fought skillfully too, man. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4000.2s)]
*  He submitted Randy Couture. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4004.2s)]
*  He arm-barred Randy Couture. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4006.2s)]
*  That was Cabbage. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4007.2s)]
*  Cabbage was an animal, bro. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4008.2s)]
*  So Cabbage was a funny dude. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4009.2s)]
*  One time me and Eddie Bravo and Cabbage were smoking weed in the hotel room in Vegas, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4013.2s)]
*  and I wanted to quit. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4017.2s)]
*  I was like, dude, we can't keep smoking weed. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4018.2s)]
*  He just kept rolling up joints. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4020.2s)]
*  And he just would, if you'd fire the joint up and say Yamoto Damashi. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4022.2s)]
*  Yamoto Damashi. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4026.2s)]
*  We completely passed through into another dimension in that hotel room. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4028.2s)]
*  We just sat around and giggled for like three hours afterwards. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4032.2s)]
*  That's funny. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4035.2s)]
*  I think, I don't remember who I was having this conversation with, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4036.2s)]
*  but I was thinking if fighters got paid way more like they want, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4040.2s)]
*  I don't know how many fighters will stick around. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4043.2s)]
*  Such a fucked sport. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4046.2s)]
*  To go through those camps and stuff, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4047.2s)]
*  I'm like, if these young fighters are making $100,000, $200,000, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4049.2s)]
*  and they're not used to making money, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4053.2s)]
*  I don't know how long it's, how serious they would take it. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4055.2s)]
*  I think the killers would all stay. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4059.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4060.2s)]
*  I think this is like what makes a Pajeda or an Adesanya or even you. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4061.2s)]
*  I think what makes people really get to that level, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4065.2s)]
*  it's not just, the motivation is not just money. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4071.2s)]
*  The motivation is glory. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4073.2s)]
*  The motivation is accomplishing this impossible task. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4075.2s)]
*  I mean, what is your motivation? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4079.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think mine now is just reaching my highest potential. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4081.2s)]
*  I'm like, damn, we're so close. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4085.2s)]
*  We're number one right now. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4087.2s)]
*  I want to be the champ, but I want to be, you know, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4088.2s)]
*  I want to see how far I can take this. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4091.2s)]
*  I want to be recognized as one of the greatest ever too. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4094.2s)]
*  And I don't want to just be recognized as a striker that knocks people out. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4097.2s)]
*  I want to be, you know, I don't want to just, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4100.2s)]
*  Alex Pajeda is like, no, just for striking. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4102.2s)]
*  Izzy was kind of just known for striking. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4104.2s)]
*  I feel like I've underrated jiu-jitsu, underrated grappling, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4106.2s)]
*  and you know, I've been training a lot. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4108.2s)]
*  I want to start, like, ideal scenario, I fight Aldo or Henry, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4110.2s)]
*  I would love to fucking choke one of these dudes. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4114.2s)]
*  Did you tap Gilbert Melendez in a tournament? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4116.2s)]
*  No, I tapped Gomi. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4119.2s)]
*  Oh, it was Takanori Gomi? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4121.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4123.2s)]
*  Sorry, Gilbert. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4124.2s)]
*  I grappled Gilbert. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4125.2s)]
*  We did an eight minute round, or it was nine, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4126.2s)]
*  eight or nine minute round, and that was a sick, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4128.2s)]
*  that was a pretty sick match. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4131.2s)]
*  That was on that UFC quintet, but... [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4132.2s)]
*  Gilbert, super underrated guy. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4134.2s)]
*  People forgot about Gilbert. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4135.2s)]
*  Yeah, but high level black belt, way bigger than me. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4137.2s)]
*  I didn't, you know, I don't think, I took that quintet very serious. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4139.2s)]
*  I trained for that, like it was a match. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4143.2s)]
*  I think a lot of the guys were just kind of going in there fucking around, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4145.2s)]
*  you know, it was like, so I don't know. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4148.2s)]
*  But I trained serious for that, and yeah, I went nine or eight minutes, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4151.2s)]
*  whatever it was, with Gilbert, and then choked Gomi. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4154.2s)]
*  But yeah, I want to start choking people. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4157.2s)]
*  I love knocking people out, but I would love to, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4159.2s)]
*  if I have an opportunity to choke someone, I would love to. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4161.2s)]
*  Well, having a well-rounded game where you're a significant threat, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4165.2s)]
*  both on your back and on the top, and not just standing up, is so important. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4168.2s)]
*  Yeah, especially in this division. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4172.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that division's just, there's so much going on in that division, man. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4174.2s)]
*  Remember when Marlon Marais was the fucking scariest guy alive? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4179.2s)]
*  He knocked out, I remember when he knocked out Alger, I was there for that. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4182.2s)]
*  I thought, that, and then when Tony Ferguson got front kicked by Michael Cheney, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4185.2s)]
*  I watched, I was like, I just witnessed the first murder in the UFC. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4190.2s)]
*  They laid there for so long. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4194.2s)]
*  Marais had this switch kick off the left leg that was a thing of fucking beauty. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4196.2s)]
*  It's one of the best switch kicks I've ever seen. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4202.2s)]
*  It's like right up there with Barboza, but Barboza would switch kick to the body, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4205.2s)]
*  and you'd be like, Jesus Christ. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4210.2s)]
*  When Barboza was in his prime, earliest, like before all the wars, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4213.2s)]
*  and bro, his switch kick was insane. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4217.2s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4221.2s)]
*  Yeah, this fight was, I mean, I think he went to throw that same switch kick and knee him. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4224.2s)]
*  Yeah, so Alger took him down, and then here. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4228.2s)]
*  Yeah, went to throw it and knee him. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4231.2s)]
*  Boom! [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4233.2s)]
*  Dude, that left, his left high kick was fucking insane. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4234.2s)]
*  Look at that. Look at that left high kick. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4237.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was beautiful. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4240.2s)]
*  Oh my God. It's so fast, too. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4241.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4244.2s)]
*  And when he was chopping at Henry in that first round, I was like, oh my God, Henry's fucked. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4245.2s)]
*  That's what I thought. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4250.2s)]
*  I'm like, he's fucked, but Marais just fell apart, and Henry just put the gas on him. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4251.2s)]
*  And he knows how to win. He just knows how to fucking win. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4256.2s)]
*  He knows how to win. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4259.2s)]
*  He's a competitor at the highest level. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4260.2s)]
*  Yeah, and it's really strange to watch how a couple of fights can change the trajectory of a fighter's career [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4261.2s)]
*  and limit how durable they are and what happens when things go sideways with them. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4269.2s)]
*  Yeah, that mentally probably fucked Marais. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4275.2s)]
*  He was dominating and then just completely gassed out. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4277.2s)]
*  Yeah, and the biggest fight of his life. He was almost the world champion. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4280.2s)]
*  Was that for a... [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4284.2s)]
*  That was for the belt. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4286.2s)]
*  Henry wasn't champ, was he? Was he at the time? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4288.2s)]
*  No one was champ, right? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4290.2s)]
*  Wasn't it for the... [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4291.2s)]
*  It was for the belt. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4293.2s)]
*  For Henry's belt? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4294.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I think it was... [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4296.2s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was for the belt. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4298.2s)]
*  Or was it... [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4300.2s)]
*  It was a title fight. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4301.2s)]
*  Right, so it was an elimination fight or was it an interim fight? Maybe it was interim? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4302.2s)]
*  Oh, maybe. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4306.2s)]
*  Was this before or after Mighty Mouse left? It's after Mighty Mouse left, right? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4307.2s)]
*  Well, this was at Mighty Mouse 25. This was at 35. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4312.2s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4314.2s)]
*  But I think it was after TJ Erno. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4315.2s)]
*  TJ Erno. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4318.2s)]
*  When he fought Marais right there, June 2019, won the vacant UFC Bantamweight Championship. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4322.2s)]
*  So it was vacant. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4329.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4330.2s)]
*  Yeah, because TJ must have got busted and then... [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4331.2s)]
*  That's right. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4334.2s)]
*  Because Henry went down to 25. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4335.2s)]
*  That's right. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4337.2s)]
*  No, TJ went down to 25 to fight Henry. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4338.2s)]
*  Well, that was just madness. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4340.2s)]
*  That was so stupid. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4341.2s)]
*  It's weird because TJ doesn't look... He's not a big 35er. He didn't look... [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4342.2s)]
*  But he looked dead. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4347.2s)]
*  Yeah, I know. He looked so bad. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4348.2s)]
*  He couldn't take shots. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4350.2s)]
*  No. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4352.2s)]
*  When you're taking EPO just to try to not be anemic, he was literally letting his body eat itself. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4353.2s)]
*  I would have liked to see TJ versus Henry at 135. That would have been a very interesting, way different fight. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4360.2s)]
*  I still think Henry could have won that fight, but it would have been way more interesting. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4364.2s)]
*  Well, I hope they can do something with TJ's shoulders. It would be a shame if that's what ends it for him. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4370.2s)]
*  I mean, he's what? 36? How old is he, Jamie? 36? 37? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4376.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was him when he was cutting down the flyweight. Just crazy, man. Just crazy. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4380.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was fucked up. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4385.2s)]
*  He's dying. The thing about that is we want to pretend that that doesn't take something out of you. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4386.2s)]
*  But it fucking does. Do you need tissues, brother? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4392.2s)]
*  No, I don't even think... [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4395.2s)]
*  He's stuffed 36 also. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4397.2s)]
*  He's TJ's 36? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4398.2s)]
*  He's gonna be 37. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4399.2s)]
*  He's gonna be 37? Appreciate it. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4400.2s)]
*  I don't want you sitting around with boogers. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4402.2s)]
*  I hate that. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4405.2s)]
*  Mocos. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4406.2s)]
*  It's so hard to concentrate. He's 37? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4407.2s)]
*  He'll be 37 in two months. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4409.2s)]
*  Yeah. He's got tremendous skills. I mean, TJ, when he won the title from Henen Berao, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4411.2s)]
*  I remember watching that performance. I'm like, God damn, TJ! [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4419.2s)]
*  I was watching that. I actually watched both those fight week when I was on the treadmill just kind of walking or whatever I was doing for that last fight. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4422.2s)]
*  I was watching those. Just fucking... I always try to find some fights that I like. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4429.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was so, so impressive when he beat Henen like that. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4433.2s)]
*  That first time. Fuck. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4436.2s)]
*  People that talk shit about TJ Dillashaw, that's like that Roy Jones Jr. song. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4437.2s)]
*  Y'all must have forgot. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4441.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4442.2s)]
*  Just go back and watch him piece up Henen Berao to win the title and do it like he's sparring. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4443.2s)]
*  Just do it so calm like he's fucking sparring. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4447.2s)]
*  He was a bad motherfucker. And even then, even then his shoulders were fucked. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4450.2s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4456.2s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4457.2s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4458.2s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4460.2s)]
*  I think he probably tore some shit early and didn't get it fixed and kept training while it was torn. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4464.2s)]
*  And then there's a lot of guys, they blow their rotator cuffs out and then they keep training. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4471.2s)]
*  TJ had some sweet, those fights against Cody, whether he was on shit or not. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4476.2s)]
*  I mean, if he wasn't, he beat Cody like that, that's super fucked up because Cody did drop him. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4481.2s)]
*  To recover as fast as he did, it could have been because of that, who knows, whatever. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4485.2s)]
*  But those fights with Cody were epic. The fight with Cory Sandhagen was fucking sweet. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4490.2s)]
*  It was a good fight, particularly knowing that he blew his fucking knee out in the first round. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4495.2s)]
*  Mental toughness, man, off the charts. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4499.2s)]
*  The fact that he took that fight and popped his fucking shoulder back into place in the middle of the Aljamain fight [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4501.2s)]
*  and even got through that first fucking round. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4507.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4509.2s)]
*  Nine months until I can start training rough and tough and then making sure everything is healed up. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4510.2s)]
*  Dilshah explained about his recovery and training timeline. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4514.2s)]
*  I've had shoulder surgery before and I'd say another year maybe to compete, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4517.2s)]
*  either a year to compete or a year to get back to a training camp. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4520.2s)]
*  This is like two days ago. I think he just had the surgery. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4524.2s)]
*  So he had the surgery to repair a torn labrum, biceps and additional work on his biceps tendon in 2019. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4527.2s)]
*  So yeah, man, his shoulders are fucked, man. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4535.2s)]
*  I wonder, yeah, I wonder if I... [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4538.2s)]
*  It's just very hard. The shoulders are very complicated joint. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4540.2s)]
*  I've been super, yeah, I've been lucky. Fucking, I'm put together pretty well so far. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4543.2s)]
*  That's great. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4547.2s)]
*  So far. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4548.2s)]
*  When shoulder issues and back and neck issues, those are giant ones. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4549.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4553.2s)]
*  The back and neck one is particularly disturbing. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4554.2s)]
*  Oh, fuck. I mean, Aljo had that neck, whatever he had. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4556.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's got an artificial disc in his neck. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4560.2s)]
*  Fuck, that's crazy. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4562.2s)]
*  He had to do it. He had to do it after that Yawn fight. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4563.2s)]
*  He said it was fucked up before that, but when Yawn hit him, I mean, you got to think, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4566.2s)]
*  if you do have a herniated disc and then you get an illegal knee that you don't expect on the ground [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4570.2s)]
*  and you're not preparing for it and you get really jolted. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4574.2s)]
*  It's so crazy. Like if Yawn didn't do that, Yawn wouldn't have ended up having to fight me. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4577.2s)]
*  And like, he's just had such, like, that sucked. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4582.2s)]
*  Crazy luck. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4584.2s)]
*  Then that last fight with Yawn Aljo. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4585.2s)]
*  I think he was asking his corner too, can I knee him in the face? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4588.2s)]
*  Didn't someone say yeah? In his corner? That's what I thought. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4592.2s)]
*  I felt like that was the... Fuck, that's true. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4595.2s)]
*  I'm so curious what that dude does next. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4598.2s)]
*  I don't think he's been kind of off the grid, not saying stuff. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4600.2s)]
*  He feels like UFC doesn't have his back or whatever. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4604.2s)]
*  Like, well, first of all, you fucking need a guy while he was down. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4607.2s)]
*  That was your own fault. It had nothing to do with UFC. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4610.2s)]
*  They gave you an immediate rematch, lost a close fight to Aljo, and he lost a close fight to me. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4612.2s)]
*  So it's just, I mean, that's a shitty... [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4616.2s)]
*  I feel like you fought one other person before. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4618.2s)]
*  Oh, you did, yeah, Corey. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4621.2s)]
*  Yeah, Corey. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4622.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4623.2s)]
*  Fought Sanhagen, which was a great fight. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4624.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4625.2s)]
*  And Sanhagen took that on short notice. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4626.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was impressive as fuck. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4629.2s)]
*  Yeah, very impressive. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4630.2s)]
*  In Abu Dhabi. Yeah, yeah, very impressive. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4631.2s)]
*  And so then he has the rematch, and I just think when you saw Al Jermain with his neck fixed, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4633.2s)]
*  and he got his... He had a dietary issue before, whereas he wasn't eating before the fight. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4640.2s)]
*  Yeah, I remember him saying that. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4647.2s)]
*  And he just was exhausted while he was in the fight, and he realized, I didn't eat anything. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4648.2s)]
*  He ate breakfast, and then he was fighting at 10 p.m. at night. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4652.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4654.2s)]
*  And this time he fueled up. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4655.2s)]
*  That'll change. That'll make me feel better. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4656.2s)]
*  He said it changed everything. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4658.2s)]
*  But I guess when you're nervous and you're not thinking about it, you forget to eat. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4660.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4663.2s)]
*  But on a fucking title fight? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4664.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's tricky, because you're like, I don't want to eat too close. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4665.2s)]
*  Like, will this food... Is there a certain sauce on there that's going to make my fucking stomach hurt before... [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4667.2s)]
*  It's a tricky fight day. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4673.2s)]
*  What do you eat generally on fight day? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4675.2s)]
*  I add... [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4677.2s)]
*  What is this? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4678.2s)]
*  This is the video of Peter... [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4679.2s)]
*  I think the link I clicked said that it's video of his corner telling him to do it. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4680.2s)]
*  Oh, okay. I'm here. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4685.2s)]
*  Let's go, Pete. Control him. We need to dig deep. Keep that pressure on. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4686.2s)]
*  Punch! Just punch! Just punch! [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4691.2s)]
*  There we go. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4693.2s)]
*  Ah, yes! Yes! [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4697.2s)]
*  Yes? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4699.2s)]
*  That one guy was saying, just punch? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4702.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's Bahama. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4703.2s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4704.2s)]
*  You get here, right? One guy's saying, just punch. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4705.2s)]
*  But then somebody in that corner goes, yes, when he says kick. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4708.2s)]
*  It's in Russian. Habib heard it sitting over here because we couldn't understand the language. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4712.2s)]
*  But someone in that corner yelled, yes, kick. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4717.2s)]
*  And then Pyotr Yan lands in a legal knee that ultimately cost him the UFC champion. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4721.2s)]
*  Dude, having good corners is... [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4726.2s)]
*  Because you have to have... You're with those motherfuckers for a week. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4729.2s)]
*  In a hotel, having three good corners. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4731.2s)]
*  I have Brandon. Doesn't know shit about fighting, strength conditioning. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4734.2s)]
*  More of a guy that stretches me out. We do breath exercises. We do stuff like that. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4737.2s)]
*  He knows. Don't yell. Don't say shit in the corner. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4741.2s)]
*  You don't know shit about fighting. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4743.2s)]
*  Augusto, Tankino. I said, if you want to say anything, if it's on the ground, grappling-wise, yell. I'm listening. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4745.2s)]
*  If it's on the feet, tell Tim because Tim's more of a striker. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4752.2s)]
*  I want to hear Tim yelling in the corner and I don't want him yelling random shit. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4756.2s)]
*  You hear some people yelling shit just to yell shit. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4760.2s)]
*  Especially in the minute you get it, you'll have all three coaches trying to tell you something. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4763.2s)]
*  It's where I feel like I've had such a good corner. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4768.2s)]
*  It's like only the person that needs to talk is Tim. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4771.2s)]
*  And then if you have something that you think is important, you can tell Tim. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4774.2s)]
*  Tim can tell me. Unless it's grappling on the ground, Tankino, say whatever the fuck you want. I'm listening. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4776.2s)]
*  But yeah, some people, the corners... [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4780.2s)]
*  Chaotic. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4783.2s)]
*  Chaotic and just fight week. You got to hang out with... I don't know. It's crazy. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4784.2s)]
*  I feel super lucky because I bet there's some fighters listening to this that are like, God damn it, he's right. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4788.2s)]
*  You bring corner men and it's like maybe you don't have three people you're super close with [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4793.2s)]
*  that you want to hang out with all fucking week while you're cutting weight. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4798.2s)]
*  I just feel so lucky I have three guys that I love being around. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4801.2s)]
*  Tankino and Brandon are so fucking quiet. They're not... It's a good vibe fight week. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4804.2s)]
*  You fought in the Apex Center? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4811.2s)]
*  Yeah, a couple times. Three times. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4814.2s)]
*  Three times? And when you fought in the Apex Center, was it during the COVID times when they had no audience? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4815.2s)]
*  I fought Eddie Wineland. That was crazy. That was fucking crazy. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4820.2s)]
*  Have you ever done that before, that fake the uppercut right hand? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4826.2s)]
*  It's like... That one specifically I think I have done, but it's just... [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4829.2s)]
*  I mean, they're all just faints. Like when I was dribbling on Chris Montino, it's all just like, look at my hands, ba-boom! [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4834.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? So I have that little uppercut three and then a two. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4841.2s)]
*  It's just like, look at my hands, like a change up in baseball, kind of slow, boom! [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4845.2s)]
*  So I fought him, then I fought... Right after that I fought Chido, and then I fought Thomas Almeida in the Apex. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4850.2s)]
*  But the Chido fight, that's going to be massive. And everyone wanted me to rematch him right away. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4857.2s)]
*  And I always said, I'm going to rematch him when the time is right and we're getting there. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4863.2s)]
*  I go out there and beat Aljoa Henry, which I truly believe I can be. I have the style, I have the skills to beat those guys. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4868.2s)]
*  Chido's first title offense, fucking massive. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4875.2s)]
*  What's Chido ranked right now? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4880.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. I think Chido versus Corey is kind of what they're... [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4882.2s)]
*  Is that happening? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4886.2s)]
*  I don't know. I know they're talking about in December. It's obviously not going to happen in December now, if I had to guess. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4887.2s)]
*  But I don't know if Chido gets past Corey. Corey's fucking... [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4893.2s)]
*  Corey's fucking good. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4896.2s)]
*  He's fucking good. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4897.2s)]
*  Marlin's four. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4898.2s)]
*  Four. And people think I hate him. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4899.2s)]
*  So Corey's six. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4901.2s)]
*  I got nothing against Chido. People think I hate him. I don't mind Chido. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4902.2s)]
*  Well, just people thought it was funny that you always said that wasn't a loss. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4906.2s)]
*  It's not. And then I'll die at that. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4908.2s)]
*  How is it not a loss? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4912.2s)]
*  And I think Chido knows too. You go watch that fight. It wasn't a calf kick, it wasn't a good leg kick. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4914.2s)]
*  It was a kick he threw and I pulled out with kicks. You either check him, step in, you eat it, or you pull out. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4921.2s)]
*  I was pulling out and I've watched it. The slow-mo. His big toe literally like pushed a button. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4928.2s)]
*  My peroneal nerve pushed a button and my foot just fell asleep. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4933.2s)]
*  But before that, I was kicking him. I kicked him so hard he spun around. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4936.2s)]
*  I was kicking his legs way harder than he was kicking mine. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4940.2s)]
*  I was out striking him. I don't think he punched me in the head once until the whole thing. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4943.2s)]
*  And then I blitzed forward and I went to step back. My foot which wasn't there, he got on top elbowed me. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4948.2s)]
*  It's a loss on the record. But I don't feel like it wasn't like I didn't go in there and lose because his skills were better than me. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4953.2s)]
*  I do not believe that. If we have a rematch and he goes in there and beats me to decision, something beats me in any other way without some kind of... [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4960.2s)]
*  If he kicks me in the nerve again, I'll think he did it on purpose. I'll be like, okay, that's fair. That's two losses. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4966.2s)]
*  But I just know it wasn't a skill set. It wasn't a lack of skills. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4970.2s)]
*  He didn't beat me because his skills were better than me that night. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4976.2s)]
*  And it sucks that camp was so fucking good. I had such a good training camp and everything was so good for that. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4978.2s)]
*  It happened. I don't feel like I lost any stock or anything. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4983.2s)]
*  I feel like everything went as it needed to go. But I just I'll never accept that as a loss as far as mentally thinking I didn't get beat that night. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4988.2s)]
*  So because it's such a button, that nerve is such a button, it almost in your mind is like a lucky punch. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=4999.2s)]
*  How many I know, as he said, his perineal nerve got kicked. That's it. But how many times from that fight until I mean, how many there's fights every weekend. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5005.2s)]
*  You rarely see that happen where the nerve gets shut off and they can't. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5012.2s)]
*  My foot, I rolled it like eight times since he when he kicked it into the end of the fight, rolled it so many times. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5017.2s)]
*  That happened to Henry against Mighty Mouse. Right. That was a big one. Yeah. We got that drop foot. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5023.2s)]
*  And the handler had one Bellator. Yep. That Jimmy Crute, I think, happened or something. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5028.2s)]
*  But you know what's weird is in that fight. Right. Oh, it was that one. I think that was it. Yeah, it might have been. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5033.2s)]
*  Yeah, look at what it was so weird. I was like, oh, shit, my foot's not working. Go back to it real quickly. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5041.2s)]
*  Yeah. Can you make it slow mo down to that bottom right or even like that? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5045.2s)]
*  I'm pulling all the way out and his toe, toe hit like it wasn't a nice calf kick. His shin didn't land on my calf. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5053.2s)]
*  It wasn't like it was just a weird fucking thing. His toe bounced off. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5060.2s)]
*  I like pushed a button and my foot turned off and it was such a weird feeling. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5065.2s)]
*  I was I could feel like I'm like, oh, shit. It was your foot. Yeah. I rolled it like eight times and I was still trying. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5070.2s)]
*  Oh, and I still outstruck him. If we're if we're counting stats, he still didn't. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5078.2s)]
*  I just didn't feel any danger. It was it was a weird, weird, weird feeling. I had to drag it. I had to I couldn't lift it. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5083.2s)]
*  What are you trying to hope it comes back? Like, what are you thinking right now? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5091.2s)]
*  So I have my ankles wrapped. And before I walked out, I was having Brandon I said, hey, we pull this. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5094.2s)]
*  This feels a little tight on my ankle. And I was wondering if it didn't come back because the ankle was wrapped too tight. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5099.2s)]
*  Because I feel like it should have came back by now. And I still had no feeling. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5104.2s)]
*  And it was so weird. Oh, God. And going backwards like that was fine. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5108.2s)]
*  It's when I tried to go, oh, you're probably watching it. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5114.2s)]
*  It's when I go forward. Oh, that wouldn't lift. Wow. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5117.2s)]
*  And he's I mean, but even before that, before that had happened, I was dominating the fight. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5122.2s)]
*  I would not getting hit. And I was I was piecing him up before the knee thing. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5128.2s)]
*  And then even now, it's like I'm not really getting beat up. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5131.2s)]
*  There was a head kick doesn't really do what I have to go backwards and drag it. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5134.2s)]
*  I can't move forward. It's crazy watching it from this angle, too, because I'm only looking at that foot now. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5138.2s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, it's totally it's totally numb on you. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5144.2s)]
*  And he hasn't really I mean, that's I don't know. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5147.2s)]
*  I like I said, I don't mind, Cheeto. It's it's it'll roll a couple more times here. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5150.2s)]
*  And then I blitz forward, which I probably shouldn't have done. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5156.2s)]
*  That was a nice kick. But my leg is just so compromised right now. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5159.2s)]
*  I can only go backwards and drag it. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5165.2s)]
*  Is it getting any better at all? I don't I don't I don't remember, honestly. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5169.2s)]
*  I just remember it had this weird like stinging feeling. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5173.2s)]
*  I wanted I was like, I need to knock this dude out is what I was thinking. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5179.2s)]
*  And I was hopping right there like, fuck, I was thinking I need to I need to throw a bomb on this motherfucker. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5182.2s)]
*  It seems like it's back a little bit. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5188.2s)]
*  No, I haven't watched it in a minute. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5193.2s)]
*  But yeah, this is going to be an exciting rematch. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5199.2s)]
*  I know I know he wants it. I want it. Nice one, too. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5201.2s)]
*  Right there. Right here is where I blitz forward and I go to step back and it's just not there. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5204.2s)]
*  Oh, and then it gets on top lands a nice fucking elbow. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5208.2s)]
*  But I wasn't even thinking about. Yeah. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5214.2s)]
*  So I'm excited. I'm excited for that. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5219.2s)]
*  I think that's a giant fucking fight. I think it's a giant fight, too. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5222.2s)]
*  The Divido is now become a star, too. Yeah. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5225.2s)]
*  And that knockout of Dominic Cruz, like, holy shit. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5229.2s)]
*  Yeah. Who else did he? Oh, Frankie. Frankie. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5232.2s)]
*  Frankie was a rough one. That was crazy, though, because Frankie won was winning that. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5235.2s)]
*  He won first round, won the second round, took him down. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5239.2s)]
*  And he would have won that fight and landed that front kick with like, what, two minutes left or something? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5242.2s)]
*  Which was so. But I mean, he's doing what he needs to do. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5247.2s)]
*  He's building his name, which is perfect for me. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5251.2s)]
*  And I think it's just makes sense that rematch is for a title main event. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5253.2s)]
*  It would be a big fight. It would be a very big fight. Be very exciting. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5257.2s)]
*  It's just a really good division in terms of all the different matchups you can make. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5261.2s)]
*  There's so many killers in that division. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5265.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there's the Adrian Giannis, the Chris Gutierrez. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5268.2s)]
*  They're like still the high top 15 or whatever. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5272.2s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking killers and killers. Yeah. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5276.2s)]
*  When you look at like MMA now, now that you're a part of it and now that you're an elite fighter [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5279.2s)]
*  and you remember what it was like when you were a kid, when you first saw it, what was your first exposure to MMA? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5287.2s)]
*  I was probably a young teenager. My dad was watching and I thought it was disgusting. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5295.2s)]
*  What year do you think this was? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5301.2s)]
*  I think it was, I don't know if it was WEC and he was watching like Uriah. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5302.2s)]
*  Well, I think even before that I was really little and it was Tito versus Chuck, I think. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5307.2s)]
*  We went over to like somebody's house and I was like pretty small, didn't watch it at all, didn't really care for it. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5312.2s)]
*  That was probably the first time I ever watched it. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5318.2s)]
*  And then the more I can remember, I was watching Uriah, I don't know if it was WEC. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5320.2s)]
*  I don't remember, but I was disgusted. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5325.2s)]
*  I'm like how these guys don't, I remember thinking how do they not break their ribs when they get kicked? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5327.2s)]
*  And why are they elbowing each other in the head? I thought it was disgusting. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5333.2s)]
*  I was like this is fucking absurd. I liked football, basketball, baseball, soccer, I liked ball sports. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5336.2s)]
*  Did not think fighting. I didn't, I don't, it's so weird. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5343.2s)]
*  I remember telling my mom, like dad's watching that again because I wanted to watch something on the TV [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5346.2s)]
*  and he was watching fighting and I knew my mom thought it was gross too. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5351.2s)]
*  So she would yell like you gotta change that or some shit. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5354.2s)]
*  So I told my dad for watching, literally watching what I do now, which is funny. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5356.2s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5361.2s)]
*  Funny to think about. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5362.2s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5363.2s)]
*  I didn't really even, even after that, once I got into fighting, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5364.2s)]
*  when I moved down to Arizona when I was 19 is when I really started watching fights. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5367.2s)]
*  But until then, yeah, I didn't really watch UFC. Even now, like I rarely watch fights. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5372.2s)]
*  Really? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5378.2s)]
*  Rarely. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5379.2s)]
*  God damn dude, I can't get enough. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5380.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5381.2s)]
*  I watch everything. I watch boxing. I watch MMA. I watch wrestling matches on YouTube. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5382.2s)]
*  I watch a lot of jujitsu. A lot of no-gi jujitsu. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5388.2s)]
*  No-gi jujitsu is a lot more fun to watch. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5391.2s)]
*  Oh man, it's so high level right now. God damn, these guys are so good. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5393.2s)]
*  Gordon Ryan, dude, the fact that Gordon Ryan would go and compete and make it look so easy [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5397.2s)]
*  with those stomach issues he was talking about is fucking mind-blowing. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5401.2s)]
*  Mental strength off the charts. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5405.2s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5406.2s)]
*  Off the charts, discipline and mental strength. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5407.2s)]
*  I like how he said he's like, I'm not the most athletic guy. I just make other people less athletic than me. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5410.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's in a sport where he just controls you with technique and skill and knowledge and discipline. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5414.2s)]
*  That fucking guy trains every day, seven days a week. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5421.2s)]
*  I don't understand. He makes the best guys, like Galvo, when he choked him. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5425.2s)]
*  Makes them look like they don't belong in there with him. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5430.2s)]
*  It's so impressive. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5433.2s)]
*  He one-armed choked him, man. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5434.2s)]
*  Yeah. The motherfucker must be so strong. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5436.2s)]
*  Oh, he's ridiculously strong. I mean, look at him. He looks like a goddamn superhero. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5439.2s)]
*  Yeah, he does. And he's fucking young, too. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5443.2s)]
*  Yeah. He lets guys take him down. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5445.2s)]
*  I know. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5447.2s)]
*  He's like, come on, take me down. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5448.2s)]
*  I know. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5449.2s)]
*  Take me good. You're gonna have to grapple. Now you're Foxville. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5450.2s)]
*  That's crazy how what Islam did to Charles, too. Got on top. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5452.2s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5456.2s)]
*  Right in the hat. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5457.2s)]
*  That is back for a good part of that round and landed some good shots. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5458.2s)]
*  Dude, I mean, that's like one... [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5462.2s)]
*  Islam had Charles back? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5464.2s)]
*  What did you say? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5465.2s)]
*  When Islam took down... [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5466.2s)]
*  I thought you said Izzy. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5467.2s)]
*  Oh, no, no. Islam. What Islam did to... I was so confused. I'm like, I didn't watch it. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5468.2s)]
*  I thought you were talking about a different fight. I thought you were talking about the Izzy fight. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5473.2s)]
*  No, when Izzy took down or beat Charles, just dropped him past right in the... [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5476.2s)]
*  Oh, when Islam took down Charles. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5481.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah, Islam. Was I saying Izzy the whole time? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5483.2s)]
*  Yeah, you said Izzy. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5485.2s)]
*  It's okay. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5486.2s)]
*  It makes sense. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5487.2s)]
*  Islam... I might have missed it. Maybe you're confusing him because I confused it. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5488.2s)]
*  But Islam's choke must be otherworldly. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5490.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5493.2s)]
*  It must be otherworldly. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5494.2s)]
*  To do that to Charles? Fuck. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5495.2s)]
*  Not just that. Like the moment he's passing, Charles is tapping. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5496.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5500.2s)]
*  Like his squeeze has got to be off the fucking charts. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5501.2s)]
*  I talked to DC about it and I said, hey, man, I go, his fucking squeeze must... he goes, oh, dope. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5504.2s)]
*  I had him demonstrate a choke on me. I thought it was going to be fun. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5510.2s)]
*  He's like, show me how you do that. Show me how you do it. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5513.2s)]
*  He goes, dude. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5515.2s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5516.2s)]
*  When he grabbed a hold of me, I was like, oh shit, this guy's going to choke me. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5517.2s)]
*  And that's DC. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5520.2s)]
*  Yeah, DC's a thick bastard. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5521.2s)]
*  He's fuckies. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5523.2s)]
*  Look at him, right? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5524.2s)]
*  Two division champion. But look at that. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5525.2s)]
*  Holy... [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5526.2s)]
*  Crazy, man. The moment he gets to the side, watch this pass, clamps it down. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5527.2s)]
*  Fast. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5531.2s)]
*  Oh, they cut it. They cut a little snippet where he passes. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5533.2s)]
*  But it's once he passes... [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5536.2s)]
*  That's Charles. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5538.2s)]
*  Charles just taps the most submissions in the history of the UFC. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5539.2s)]
*  And he taps like that. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5543.2s)]
*  Charles' little run he had right there with... [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5544.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5547.2s)]
*  Yeah, Chandler, Gagey... who else? Was it one more? Chandler, Gage, Adam, whoever. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5548.2s)]
*  But yeah, that was... I want to see him win so bad. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5554.2s)]
*  Poirier. Dustin Poirier. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5556.2s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5557.2s)]
*  Yeah, he tapped everybody. He's a monster. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5558.2s)]
*  Charles is a guy that just changed. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5561.2s)]
*  Whatever he was before, it's like you got to forget that when you fight him. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5565.2s)]
*  You're fighting this do or die assassin. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5569.2s)]
*  He's just an assassin. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5573.2s)]
*  And something shifted and he became the best fucking lightweight in the world. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5575.2s)]
*  It's the weirdest thing, man. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5579.2s)]
*  It's got to be just mental. I mean, Jorge, similar to. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5580.2s)]
*  It's got to be something mental or just something clicks. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5583.2s)]
*  I think with him, he said that it was the birth of his daughter. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5586.2s)]
*  That can do it. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5589.2s)]
*  That he was just so committed and driven now. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5591.2s)]
*  But the way he fights too, man, he's so exciting. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5596.2s)]
*  He just goes right into the fire, man. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5600.2s)]
*  There's no like, let's play it safe. It's like, come on, hit the fucking gas. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5603.2s)]
*  I wonder how much that was to do with his eyes. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5608.2s)]
*  I know that was the first time he fought after the eye surgery. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5610.2s)]
*  But before that, he said it was so bad. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5613.2s)]
*  Whenever he had to get so that close, just come straight forward, get that close. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5616.2s)]
*  And dial it in, not really pack up. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5619.2s)]
*  Because I mean, he's long. He could be an outside fighter, but he's not. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5621.2s)]
*  He's fucking pressure counter. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5624.2s)]
*  He's playing a blurry video game. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5627.2s)]
*  Yeah, fuck. Blurry video game. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5629.2s)]
*  And he's piecing people up. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5632.2s)]
*  I mean, it was also his technique. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5634.2s)]
*  His technique is so clean. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5637.2s)]
*  Like when he landed that left hook on Chandler, like, my goodness, it's so pretty. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5639.2s)]
*  Long steps in. It's just perfect. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5645.2s)]
*  Hands are always up high. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5648.2s)]
*  And Islam just took him apart. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5650.2s)]
*  Took him apart on the feet. Took him apart on the ground. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5652.2s)]
*  That's how good Islam is. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5655.2s)]
*  I don't even know if I've watched that fight. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5656.2s)]
*  Because I was doing media and shit in the back after. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5658.2s)]
*  So I don't even know if I really watched the full fight yet. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5661.2s)]
*  It's a good fight to watch. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5664.2s)]
*  Yeah, I need to watch that. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5666.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good fight to watch. Just to see how good he is. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5668.2s)]
*  The Dober fight scared me too. I was like, Jesus. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5670.2s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5673.2s)]
*  Like, Dober was just fucked the moment he got him down. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5674.2s)]
*  That scared me too. I was like, oh shit. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5676.2s)]
*  If he can do that to Dober, make him look helpless. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5678.2s)]
*  Volkanovsky versus Islam is so fascinating. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5681.2s)]
*  I think that's the fight I wanted to see. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5684.2s)]
*  Really? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5686.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5687.2s)]
*  Volk versus Islam. Yeah. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5688.2s)]
*  Would you have rather seen Islam fight someone else in the lightweight division? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5690.2s)]
*  Well, who would it be? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5694.2s)]
*  Benil. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5696.2s)]
*  Maybe Dariush. There's a good argument there. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5697.2s)]
*  Especially he just won and he's due. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5699.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5702.2s)]
*  I mean, that's a fucking exciting fight. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5703.2s)]
*  Benil versus anybody is an exciting fight. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5705.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5707.2s)]
*  Who else? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5708.2s)]
*  Poirier just beat Chandler, potentially him. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5710.2s)]
*  But Gamera would have been interesting if he had gotten past Benil. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5713.2s)]
*  But I think Volkanovsky, dude, that motherfucker is good. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5719.2s)]
*  He's so good and he's so compact that I think it's going to be an interesting fight. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5723.2s)]
*  Do you think he's big enough to compete against a guy like Islam who's a really big 55? [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5727.2s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5732.2s)]
*  That's why I guess we'll have to wait and see. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5733.2s)]
*  Islam is big. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5736.2s)]
*  I don't know what he's cutting, but he's got the perfect physique for that weight class. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5738.2s)]
*  He's very, very lean. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5743.2s)]
*  He makes the weight and he's obviously way bigger when he's competing. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5746.2s)]
*  He doesn't look anything like a 55-pound guy. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5751.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5754.2s)]
*  In Volk, he's pretty small. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5755.2s)]
*  Yeah, in comparison when you look at the two of them together. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5757.2s)]
*  But the thing is the grappling. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5759.2s)]
*  You remember, if you look at Volkanovsky, he's got real good takedown defense and he can take guys down. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5762.2s)]
*  Took Max Holloway down a bunch. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5772.2s)]
*  But he's not the biggest guy even at 45. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5774.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5779.2s)]
*  And when you're going up to face a big guy at 55, but also has Islam seen anybody that can move as fast as Volkanovsky? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5780.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5788.2s)]
*  He's catching him. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5789.2s)]
*  What if he catches him a few times on the feet and if he can avoid a takedown? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5790.2s)]
*  You're dealing with a significantly quicker guy probably. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5794.2s)]
*  He's probably never fought anybody that quick. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5797.2s)]
*  Remember when Ortega had Volk locked up and a guillotine mounted? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5799.2s)]
*  That was insane. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5802.2s)]
*  Now imagine if Islam had that. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5803.2s)]
*  Yeah, I forget about that. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5805.2s)]
*  Now imagine Islam in that same position. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5806.2s)]
*  Yeah, getting up. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5808.2s)]
*  He might not get out of the round. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5809.2s)]
*  He might not get out of that. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5810.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5811.2s)]
*  I think Islam has a next level, otherworldly squeeze. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5812.2s)]
*  It just seems like he gets a hold of these guys and they just can't do jack shit. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5816.2s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5820.2s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5822.2s)]
*  But Volkanovsky goes out there, cracks him and changed the whole fight. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5823.2s)]
*  Well, we have to remember Islam did get KO'd in one of his early fights. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5827.2s)]
*  Bad. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5832.2s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5833.2s)]
*  That was a nice, I think it was just a right hand. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5834.2s)]
*  Who KO'd him? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5837.2s)]
*  I forget. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5838.2s)]
*  That was very... [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5839.2s)]
*  Adriano Martins. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5841.2s)]
*  Oh, Adriano Martins. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5843.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5845.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5846.2s)]
*  Very familiar with that guy. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5847.2s)]
*  See if you can find that fight. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5848.2s)]
*  October 2015. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5849.2s)]
*  2015. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5850.2s)]
*  So I think that might have even been his UFC debut. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5851.2s)]
*  No, he had one more before that. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5854.2s)]
*  One fight by submission right before that. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5856.2s)]
*  Yeah, all these guys say, yeah, he hasn't fought anybody. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5859.2s)]
*  It's like no one will fight. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5861.2s)]
*  Everyone was turning his head. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5863.2s)]
*  He was the boogie man. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5864.2s)]
*  He was the boogie man. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5865.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5866.2s)]
*  There's certain guys you hear about from training stories and you go, jeez, that was Glover. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5867.2s)]
*  Everybody said that about Glover. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5871.2s)]
*  Glover was locked out of the United States for six years. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5873.2s)]
*  Really? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5875.2s)]
*  He couldn't get a visa. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5876.2s)]
*  Yeah, when Glover was in his prime. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5877.2s)]
*  Damn, that sucks. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5878.2s)]
*  We got an after his prime Glover. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5879.2s)]
*  When Glover was in his prime, he was the boogie man. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5881.2s)]
*  That was quick. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5886.2s)]
*  Was it that fast? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5887.2s)]
*  Oh, shit, I didn't realize it was like... [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5888.2s)]
*  This looks... [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5894.2s)]
*  Oh, that right hand was clean. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5895.2s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5898.2s)]
*  I bet that guy is feeling good nowadays. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5901.2s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5903.2s)]
*  That was a fast right hand. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5904.2s)]
*  What a clean right hand. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5906.2s)]
*  Damn, that is a clean right hand. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5908.2s)]
*  Oh. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5912.2s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5913.2s)]
*  Dude, fighting is fucking crazy. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5914.2s)]
*  Oh, it's so crazy. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5916.2s)]
*  Wonder where that guy's career went after that. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5918.2s)]
*  No, Islam is a fucking... [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5920.2s)]
*  I think Cowboy KO'd him too. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5922.2s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5924.2s)]
*  Adriana Martins, I think he fought Cowboy. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5925.2s)]
*  See if that's true. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5927.2s)]
*  Make sure that's true. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5928.2s)]
*  I think that was a sweet head kick that Donald landed. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5929.2s)]
*  Yeah, Donald had some fucking clean kickboxing. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5933.2s)]
*  Who was it, Donald? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5936.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5937.2s)]
*  That's right. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5938.2s)]
*  In Chicago. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5939.2s)]
*  Oh, Donald had some amazing head kick KO's. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5940.2s)]
*  Yeah, he had some... [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5942.2s)]
*  The one against, what was it, Rick Storey? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5943.2s)]
*  Oh my God, the combination. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5945.2s)]
*  With a combo with a one, two, three head... [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5947.2s)]
*  Yeah, just overwhelmed him. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5950.2s)]
*  I think it broke that dude's jaw. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5952.2s)]
*  He just was so pretty too, the way he put it together. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5954.2s)]
*  That was beautiful. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5957.2s)]
*  That was a fucking beautiful combination. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5958.2s)]
*  You ever go back and watch old WECs? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5960.2s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5963.2s)]
*  That's that same dude? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5966.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5967.2s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5968.2s)]
*  Oh, right on the neck. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5969.2s)]
*  Dude. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5971.2s)]
*  Holy. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5972.2s)]
*  That was amazing. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5973.2s)]
*  I don't really go back and watch much. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5974.2s)]
*  There's random ones I'll go back and rewatch. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5976.2s)]
*  I rewatched recently the Homs-Otvers-Gilbert. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5978.2s)]
*  That fucking fight was crazy. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5981.2s)]
*  That was such a pretty kick. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5983.2s)]
*  That was. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5985.2s)]
*  That turned his lights right off. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5986.2s)]
*  He did that to Matt Brown too, remember? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5988.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5990.2s)]
*  Fighting's a fucked up sport. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5994.2s)]
*  It's a fucked up sport. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5995.2s)]
*  It's crazy when people get knocked out cold and come back and keep winning. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=5997.2s)]
*  That's impressive. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6000.2s)]
*  What do you think, when you see boxing, and boxing seems to have more deaths than MMA, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6002.2s)]
*  do you think that's because of the knockdowns? [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6009.2s)]
*  Do you think that's because you get a chance to revitalize and get back? [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6012.2s)]
*  Or do you think it's just punching? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6016.2s)]
*  Do you think there's anything to the idea that getting knocked down [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6018.2s)]
*  and giving someone an eight count or a ten count to get up and then letting the fight go on? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6022.2s)]
*  That can't be good. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6028.2s)]
*  That can't be good, right? [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6029.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6031.2s)]
*  I think a couple things. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6032.2s)]
*  That definitely is not good. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6033.2s)]
*  Dude, I had a pro boxing fight a while back and I went to a gym, a pro boxing gym. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6035.2s)]
*  You spar Monday, Wednesday, Friday, three times a week, hard. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6040.2s)]
*  I think it's a lot of the damage is in sparring. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6045.2s)]
*  Then you go in there, get dropped, you get back up, get an eight count, get dropped again. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6050.2s)]
*  So I think it's probably a mixture between how hard those motherfuckers spar [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6054.2s)]
*  and then the accumulation of getting hit in the head and getting dropped [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6057.2s)]
*  and then the ref's like, here, we'll let you feel decent enough to be able to continue. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6061.2s)]
*  It's hard to watch. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6065.2s)]
*  So you think it's probably damage taken in the gym as well [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6067.2s)]
*  is what's happening in that fight that's causing that? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6070.2s)]
*  I think so. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6072.2s)]
*  Do they just get hit more? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6073.2s)]
*  I watch a lot of boxing sparring video footage that people put up [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6075.2s)]
*  and I'm like, Jesus, these guys are fighting. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6079.2s)]
*  Fighting. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6081.2s)]
*  Fighting. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6082.2s)]
*  Yeah, fuck that. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6083.2s)]
*  Like KOing people and people are hooting and hollering and people get KOed. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6084.2s)]
*  Sometimes you get these guys and it's like you have a crowd. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6087.2s)]
*  Oh, it's a fight. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6091.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's really a fight. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6092.2s)]
*  And you're supposed to be learning how to spar and move and preparing for fights. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6094.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's just as intelligence. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6100.2s)]
*  Provado over intelligence, right? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6103.2s)]
*  Yeah, you just got to be maybe just more educated on how important the brain is. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6106.2s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like you should already know. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6111.2s)]
*  So do you think overall MMA fighters spar less hard than boxers do? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6113.2s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6120.2s)]
*  I feel like sparring nowadays is getting less and less intense as far as taking care of each other. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6123.2s)]
*  But if you go to a new gym, these aren't really your boys. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6130.2s)]
*  It depends who you're sparring. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6133.2s)]
*  If you're sparring your buddies and stuff and you care about them, [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6134.2s)]
*  but if you're sparring some random guy that comes in the gym and is like, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6137.2s)]
*  I mean, I've done that. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6140.2s)]
*  I've sparring new guys come in the gym. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6142.2s)]
*  Now you're in the cage because you have the in the cage sparring, the hard sparring, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6143.2s)]
*  and then you have the outside sparring where everyone's kind of going a little bit lighter. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6146.2s)]
*  But in the cage sparring, if you don't know someone and they come in, it's kind of a fight. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6149.2s)]
*  It's life or death in there. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6154.2s)]
*  It shouldn't be, but it is. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6155.2s)]
*  We're all alphas. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6157.2s)]
*  We're fucking killers. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6158.2s)]
*  We're all doing the same shit trying to survive. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6159.2s)]
*  And I'm sure you have guys that visit the gym that go there specifically looking to try to spar with a guy like you. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6161.2s)]
*  Yeah, we I don't really do that. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6166.2s)]
*  Do you make sure that that doesn't happen? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6168.2s)]
*  Like, you don't you get to know a guy before you spar with them. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6170.2s)]
*  Yeah, I can't remember the last time I've just sparring some random guy. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6172.2s)]
*  Did you see Sean Strickland? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6176.2s)]
*  Sparring that boxer? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6178.2s)]
*  Some boxer was talking shit to him. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6180.2s)]
*  Have you seen it, Jamie? It's amazing. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6182.2s)]
*  He took all the shots. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6184.2s)]
*  I fucking love that dude. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6186.2s)]
*  I think he's so ridiculous. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6188.2s)]
*  Dude, he's so ridiculous. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6190.2s)]
*  He's a fucking character. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6192.2s)]
*  He's a character and a half man. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6194.2s)]
*  I'm a look I'm a fan of characters. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6195.2s)]
*  That guy's a character and a half. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6197.2s)]
*  But that video is so hilarious because this guy was talking shit to him. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6198.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6201.2s)]
*  And so he started sparring him and he started talking shit. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6202.2s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6204.2s)]
*  I do think fucking that's brain damage at its finest though. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6205.2s)]
*  Because I mean shit. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6209.2s)]
*  It's also sparring constantly. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6212.2s)]
*  Like Sean spars so much his distance control is excellent. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6214.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6218.2s)]
*  It's really good, man. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6219.2s)]
*  Well, wasn't he sparring like a couple of weeks after a prey had knocked him out? [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6220.2s)]
*  I'm sure he was. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6223.2s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6224.2s)]
*  He's an animal. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6225.2s)]
*  Yeah, but a dumb one. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6226.2s)]
*  So the guy was talking shit to him back. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6228.2s)]
*  I'm ready to die here. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6231.2s)]
*  I'm ready to die here. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6233.2s)]
*  And then after he was all boys with him, gave him a hundred bucks. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6234.2s)]
*  That was funny. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6237.2s)]
*  He says fuck you. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6242.2s)]
*  It tells him to hit him. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6244.2s)]
*  That kid was tough. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6247.2s)]
*  He took it. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6248.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6249.2s)]
*  Well, I think the guy's a good boxer. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6250.2s)]
*  But Sean is also quite a bit bigger than him it looks too. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6254.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6257.2s)]
*  Quite a bit. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6258.2s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6264.2s)]
*  That's an intense dude. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6265.2s)]
*  That's intense, man. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6266.2s)]
*  I wouldn't want to get in a street fight with him. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6267.2s)]
*  So that guy I knew was the perfect guy for Pahetta. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6269.2s)]
*  When he walks forward like this and he just keeps that pressure on you, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6274.2s)]
*  I'm like that is the guy where Pahetta is going to shine and you're going to get to see. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6279.2s)]
*  Because everybody sees what Sean Strickland does to people. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6282.2s)]
*  He marches motherfuckers down. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6284.2s)]
*  He puts that heat on you. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6286.2s)]
*  You know, he's a bad man. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6288.2s)]
*  Very skilled. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6290.2s)]
*  Pahetta just was like, let me just find a little spot. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6291.2s)]
*  Oh, that left hook, dude. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6294.2s)]
*  And then two right hands on the way down. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6296.2s)]
*  Did you see that? [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6298.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6299.2s)]
*  That was fast. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6300.2s)]
*  He hit him twice while he was falling. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6301.2s)]
*  Unnecessarily. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6302.2s)]
*  He hits him with the left. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6303.2s)]
*  He's going. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6304.2s)]
*  And then twice while he's falling, he right hands him. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6305.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6307.2s)]
*  Bro, that guy is fucking terrifying. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6308.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6311.2s)]
*  There's so many good fighters right now. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6312.2s)]
*  The sport is on fire, man. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6314.2s)]
*  It really is. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6316.2s)]
*  He's so snappy with those kicks, too. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6318.2s)]
*  It just gets you thinking, gets you thinking low. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6320.2s)]
*  And then what? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6322.2s)]
*  Those kicks come out of nowhere, those calf kicks, man. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6323.2s)]
*  He does a good job jabbing to the body. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6325.2s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6327.2s)]
*  Boom, boom. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6328.2s)]
*  He hits him twice on the way down. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6329.2s)]
*  Fucking insane. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6331.2s)]
*  He jabs to the body and then fucking comes over the top with that left hook. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6332.2s)]
*  It's so beautiful. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6334.2s)]
*  That left hook is nuclear. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6336.2s)]
*  I was watching Pahetta highlight this camp before sparring. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6337.2s)]
*  Getting the mindset. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6340.2s)]
*  It's like fucking. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6341.2s)]
*  It's crazy, just for even sparring, you've got to prepare. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6342.2s)]
*  Like, it's a fight for me. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6345.2s)]
*  I prepare every Saturday. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6347.2s)]
*  Like, I'm going into, like, making that walk. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6349.2s)]
*  I'm going to fucking. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6351.2s)]
*  You've got to get into that same head space. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6352.2s)]
*  Because getting into that head space is a fucking skill of its own. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6354.2s)]
*  Getting into that zone, into that. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6356.2s)]
*  When you're in the cage sparring, being able to just be sparring, just sparring. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6358.2s)]
*  It's a skill. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6364.2s)]
*  Some people go in there and you're sparring and you're fucking thinking about something else or something hurts. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6365.2s)]
*  And you're thinking about it. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6369.2s)]
*  But yeah, I was watching a bunch of Pahetta highlights before sparring. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6370.2s)]
*  Getting into that mindset. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6374.2s)]
*  When you, have you evolved your way of preparing for sparring to mimic fights? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6376.2s)]
*  Or have you come up with something that you do when you're training that you do during fights in your mind? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6383.2s)]
*  Like, how you prepare your mind? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6390.2s)]
*  For like a specific fighter? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6391.2s)]
*  Or what do you mean? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6394.2s)]
*  Just like when you know you're making the walk. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6395.2s)]
*  Do you have a specific head space you put yourself in? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6396.2s)]
*  For me, I always get to the gym early. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6400.2s)]
*  I always do, especially for sparring. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6403.2s)]
*  Because you get in the back and you're sitting there. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6405.2s)]
*  You can sit there for an hour, two hours. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6407.2s)]
*  So I go to the gym early, kind of just sit around, stretch, warm up. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6408.2s)]
*  I'll have some headphones on playing. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6412.2s)]
*  Leading up to the fight, I'm very, very calm. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6414.2s)]
*  I'll be listening to some Jack Johnson. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6418.2s)]
*  Something just like, something relaxing. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6420.2s)]
*  Something that makes me feel relaxed. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6422.2s)]
*  Until it's time to, okay, let's start warming up for real. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6424.2s)]
*  You know, we got 30 minutes of the fight. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6427.2s)]
*  Then I'll throw in some other music. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6428.2s)]
*  Get my head space then and start warming up. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6430.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6433.2s)]
*  Nothing, just always the same. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6436.2s)]
*  I just make, what I've gotten a lot better at is warming up. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6439.2s)]
*  It just helps so much with preventing injuries for everything. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6442.2s)]
*  Going into sparring or going into competition training or wrestling or whatever it is. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6445.2s)]
*  But just getting to the gym always like 30 minutes before class starts. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6449.2s)]
*  Before the warm up. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6452.2s)]
*  So I'd probably say long warm ups. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6454.2s)]
*  So the long warm ups, also you're preparing your mind. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6458.2s)]
*  You're getting your mind right while you're stretching out. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6461.2s)]
*  And that's true. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6464.2s)]
*  And every time it's just following my breath. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6465.2s)]
*  Nasal. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6467.2s)]
*  I feel like that helps me quiet the mind. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6468.2s)]
*  It might not be just fucking blank with no thoughts. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6471.2s)]
*  But there's a lot less thoughts. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6474.2s)]
*  The thoughts are slower rather than so many random thoughts. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6476.2s)]
*  Just breathing and getting into my meditation. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6479.2s)]
*  Kind of just getting into my breath. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6481.2s)]
*  I feel like there's a bridge between just like the craziness and then the flow. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6483.2s)]
*  I get there through breath. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6487.2s)]
*  I feel like there's a bridge to that space. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6489.2s)]
*  So before every session, especially sparring, is breath work. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6492.2s)]
*  Whether it's long, just inhales and holds, exhales, holds. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6496.2s)]
*  Just kind of playing with the breath. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6501.2s)]
*  Like it's a game rather than just thinking and not concentrating on the breath. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6503.2s)]
*  And when you're warming up, do you have a specific routine that you follow every day? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6508.2s)]
*  Do you have like a whole series of movements that you do to try to get everything loose? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6513.2s)]
*  Or do you just kind of flow? [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6517.2s)]
*  I always hit, I'll warm up like 10 minutes on the air dime just before I start stretching. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6519.2s)]
*  It depends if my lower left back's a little bit more sore, I'll kind of focus on that. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6523.2s)]
*  I'll hit cat cows, hit certain positions, just breathe into it. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6527.2s)]
*  Or if my knee's more sore, I'll really focus on my knee more so. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6530.2s)]
*  So it's not a specific set of stretches or anything. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6533.2s)]
*  It's kind of more of how I'm feeling that day. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6537.2s)]
*  The air dime is the shit. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6539.2s)]
*  It is. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6541.2s)]
*  I have that rogue version, the Echo bike. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6542.2s)]
*  It's the shit, because even if you're hurt, like if your foot's hurt, you could do it. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6545.2s)]
*  If your knee's hurt, you could do it. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6548.2s)]
*  If you've got a back problem, get on that fucking bike. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6550.2s)]
*  You could still do it. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6552.2s)]
*  It's the most low impact to me and the hardest shit to do. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6553.2s)]
*  Yeah, I love running in camp. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6556.2s)]
*  I love doing sprints. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6558.2s)]
*  I feel like that's where I really can feel like my cardio improves is doing the fucking hard sprints. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6559.2s)]
*  But there's been camps where my knee's fucked up. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6564.2s)]
*  I'm like, I've got to do the air dime. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6566.2s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, I've got to do the air dime. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6568.2s)]
*  That fucking thing is torturous. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6570.2s)]
*  Do it, it really is. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6571.2s)]
*  That thing's a motherfucker. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6572.2s)]
*  Do you do any plyometrics or anything to increase your foot strength and movement? [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6573.2s)]
*  Yeah, Brandon will have me doing stuff like that. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6578.2s)]
*  Stand on one foot, then jump sideways up, doing box jumps, shit like that. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6580.2s)]
*  Yeah, definitely do stuff like that. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6586.2s)]
*  I think all that plyometric. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6588.2s)]
*  Do you know who Nick Curzon is? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6590.2s)]
*  He's the guy from Speed of Sport. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6592.2s)]
*  He worked with Hafele Dosandjos when Dosandjos was in his prime when he was really fucking everybody up. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6594.2s)]
*  People forgot that too. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6600.2s)]
*  Hafele Dosandjos. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6602.2s)]
*  Remember when he took apart Neil Magni? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6604.2s)]
*  Just fucking leg kicked him, took him to the ground, strangled him. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6605.2s)]
*  Dude, Dosandjos was an animal. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6608.2s)]
*  The black belt all around fighter. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6610.2s)]
*  Oh my god, he was a fucking animal. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6612.2s)]
*  He's fighting Brian Barrina. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6613.2s)]
*  Great fight. Great fight. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6615.2s)]
*  Yeah, Brian's a good fucking dude. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6616.2s)]
*  He's a tough motherfucker, man. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6617.2s)]
*  When he knocked out Robbie Lara, I was like, oh shit. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6619.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was on my card. One of my cards. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6621.2s)]
*  So this is Nick Curzon. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6623.2s)]
*  He's been on the podcast before in the past too. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6625.2s)]
*  Very interesting training philosophy. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6627.2s)]
*  And he comes from that Marv Marinovich school. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6629.2s)]
*  You know, Marv Marinovich was the guy who got BJ Penn in shape when BJ was in his fucking prime. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6631.2s)]
*  There was a few fights where BJ trained with the Marinoviches and they just forced him to get in insane shape. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6637.2s)]
*  Because BJ loved to fight. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6643.2s)]
*  He was super talented, but he didn't really want to train the way they wanted him to train. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6647.2s)]
*  They wanted him to train this way. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6651.2s)]
*  So it's all plyos and they all come from this school. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6653.2s)]
*  This is the school of thought. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6657.2s)]
*  You already know how to fight. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6659.2s)]
*  You know how to fight. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6661.2s)]
*  That should be the least of your concern in camp. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6663.2s)]
*  In camp, you should be getting in the most insane physical shape you possibly can. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6665.2s)]
*  And his thing was like that training skills is secondary. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6670.2s)]
*  You already have these skills. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6674.2s)]
*  But if you could get yourself to fucking insane levels of physical fitness at an elite level, he felt like that's the correct compromise. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6676.2s)]
*  I think for me, when I do most of my cardio, it's doing the actual sport. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6685.2s)]
*  Whether it's sparring or hitting mitts and then having someone grapple and then you have to hit mitts again, then someone's on your back. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6690.2s)]
*  Or just wrestling, just doing the actual sport for cardio. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6696.2s)]
*  You can't beat that. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6702.2s)]
*  Well, that's George St. Pierre's approach. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6703.2s)]
*  George St. Pierre told me that after a while he realized that efficiency was the most important. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6705.2s)]
*  And so that getting really good at the movements, you had less energy you were exerting, you were more efficient. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6709.2s)]
*  Gordon Ryan says the same thing. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6715.2s)]
*  Gordon obviously is in amazing shape, but he's also very efficient. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6717.2s)]
*  And that efficiency comes from just insane levels of repetitions and drills. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6721.2s)]
*  So there's like a saying, like George's position is kind of the opposite of Nick Kershaw's, but they both, I think they both have, there's a positive to both approaches. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6726.2s)]
*  Because if you're not, if you already have efficiency, like so you get to a level like where you're at right now, if you took six weeks and just had a wild strength and conditioning camp, you're not going to lose any efficiency. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6736.2s)]
*  You already have a completely tuned in body. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6745.2s)]
*  You're already very aware of your skill set. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6748.2s)]
*  So if you just got wrapped up into the most fucking psychotic state of physical fitness possible, how much would you lose of what you already have? [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6750.2s)]
*  I don't know if you'd lose much. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6759.2s)]
*  I don't think you'd lose much, but dude, there's nothing that gets you in shape for fighting than fighting. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6761.2s)]
*  Nope, that's true. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6765.2s)]
*  Like you can go do the six weeks of fucking crazy cardio and then go do three fives in the cage sparring and be fucking gassed. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6766.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6773.2s)]
*  That's what's interesting too is like this next fight, my next fight, 100% I'm fighting for a title. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6774.2s)]
*  I don't know who it is. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6778.2s)]
*  I don't care if it's Henry. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6779.2s)]
*  I don't care if it's Aldo. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6780.2s)]
*  I'm fighting for a title 100%. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6781.2s)]
*  So if they give you, what if they say you and Cheeto for an interim title? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6782.2s)]
*  Would you go for an interim title? [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6786.2s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6787.2s)]
*  But they're not, unless Aldo was injured. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6788.2s)]
*  Aldo's obviously not injured and he's capable of fighting so they wouldn't do that. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6791.2s)]
*  But yes, I would fight 100%. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6794.2s)]
*  But five fives, never fought five fives, never fought main event, never done been five rounds. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6797.2s)]
*  So that's going to be a super interesting and I've been the last three, four fights like in sparring. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6801.2s)]
*  Hey, let's do an extra round. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6806.2s)]
*  Let's go on that outside, hit mitts for an extra two rounds. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6807.2s)]
*  Let's kind of start. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6809.2s)]
*  So we've been preparing for that, but that that's crazy. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6810.2s)]
*  Five fives is the next next one in that change. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6814.2s)]
*  Dude, that's like fighting twice as long damn near. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6817.2s)]
*  Like that's a fucking long time to fight extra. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6820.2s)]
*  So depending upon the amount of damage you took in the first two, you're fighting, you know, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6823.2s)]
*  fucked up legs, fucked up rib. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6828.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a, you know, Chael Sonnen said it best. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6830.2s)]
*  He really did. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6834.2s)]
*  He said no human being is supposed to fight for 25 minutes. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6835.2s)]
*  He's like, you can't, you can't fight for 25 minutes. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6838.2s)]
*  So you got to pace yourself. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6841.2s)]
*  You got to figure it out. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6842.2s)]
*  But no one's going 100% for 25 minutes. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6843.2s)]
*  You just can't do it. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6845.2s)]
*  It's too much time. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6846.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6847.2s)]
*  And then you see some of those guys, I think, like, was it Colby versus Kamaru? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6848.2s)]
*  Like their five fives was like super fucking high pace. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6852.2s)]
*  There's some that are just insanely fucking. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6855.2s)]
*  I think Gamera versus someone was just an insane fucking main event. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6858.2s)]
*  Well, you know, that's also the argument about wrestling, right? [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6861.2s)]
*  Like if you watch wrestlers wrestling, imagine if wrestling was no time limit. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6864.2s)]
*  It'd be a completely different game. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6869.2s)]
*  You could never go at each other the way you're growing at each other. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6872.2s)]
*  Because you know you can't keep that up. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6874.2s)]
*  You're doing that because you know you have a time period in which you're going to [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6876.2s)]
*  they're going to blow the whistle and the time's up. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6879.2s)]
*  And you either win or you don't win in that time period. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6881.2s)]
*  But if you had like Gordon does those no time limit matches, and that's a mind fucking a half. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6883.2s)]
*  That's a mind fucking a half. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6890.2s)]
*  Like Felipe PeÃ±a. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6893.2s)]
*  I saw that one. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6894.2s)]
*  I skimmed through it and watched the whole thing. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6895.2s)]
*  But yeah, he's a fucking world champion and he quits at 45 minutes. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6897.2s)]
*  I'm like, I'm done. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6902.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6903.2s)]
*  That was like a couple days after he found out. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6904.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6906.2s)]
*  Leandro Lowe was that was I can't imagine fucking. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6907.2s)]
*  No, I couldn't imagine that even compete like that. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6909.2s)]
*  But still, they're going to do it again. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6911.2s)]
*  Are they? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6913.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're doing it again. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6914.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're doing it again in Texas. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6915.2s)]
*  I think find out that they just announced that maybe it's on who's number one's website [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6918.2s)]
*  because I think it's a who's number one event. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6924.2s)]
*  But I think they're going to do the same thing. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6926.2s)]
*  No time limits. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6928.2s)]
*  It's crazy because you want to go. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6929.2s)]
*  I'd go. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6931.2s)]
*  Oh, I'd go watch. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6932.2s)]
*  I would definitely go watch that. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6933.2s)]
*  I think watching in person would be a lot more entertaining than watching on a computer [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6934.2s)]
*  because then you're watching you're like, well, I could go fuck around for 20 minutes. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6937.2s)]
*  When is this November? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6940.2s)]
*  When is it? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6941.2s)]
*  Wait. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6942.2s)]
*  No, that's the that's the date of the announcement. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6943.2s)]
*  February 25th. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6944.2s)]
*  Couple days. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6945.2s)]
*  February 25th. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6946.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6947.2s)]
*  And where is that going to be at? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6948.2s)]
*  Oh, I felt like someone said that it was going to be. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6950.2s)]
*  Costa Mesa, California. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6953.2s)]
*  Oh, it's in. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6954.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6955.2s)]
*  OK. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6956.2s)]
*  So it is in. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6957.2s)]
*  OK. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6958.2s)]
*  Costa Mesa. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6959.2s)]
*  I wonder who I'm wonder if they have a couple of good, good, good match done that. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6960.2s)]
*  I'm sure they do. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6963.2s)]
*  They always do. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6964.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6965.2s)]
*  Whose number one is awesome when it's in Texas is the shit because they were doing it during [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6966.2s)]
*  covid in these hotel ballrooms. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6970.2s)]
*  Oh, no one there. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6973.2s)]
*  It was like me and Lex Friedman went to one of the first events and we're sitting there. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6975.2s)]
*  We have like chairs right at the front of the mat and there's no one in the crowd. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6979.2s)]
*  There's like me. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6983.2s)]
*  And then slowly started letting more people in the crowd. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6984.2s)]
*  And after a while, they put up bleachers. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6986.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6988.2s)]
*  Basically the same thing. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6989.2s)]
*  But it was amazing. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6990.2s)]
*  That's when I first saw Mikey Musumechi compete. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6991.2s)]
*  That motherfucker is scary, too. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6993.2s)]
*  Oh, he's amazing. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6995.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6996.2s)]
*  Listen, listen to him on the pod was he's a character. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=6997.2s)]
*  He's so nice. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7000.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's so nice. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7001.2s)]
*  Such a sweet guy. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7002.2s)]
*  You see how he sits. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7003.2s)]
*  Was he just sitting there like fucking? [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7004.2s)]
*  No, on the ground. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7006.2s)]
*  He can sit on the ground where his butt is touching the ground and his knees are bent [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7007.2s)]
*  like a frog. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7012.2s)]
*  Like you can't believe it. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7013.2s)]
*  Perfect jitsu body. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7014.2s)]
*  Just like. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7015.2s)]
*  You like you can't believe you can. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7016.2s)]
*  Didn't I take a photo of it and I put it on my Instagram? [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7017.2s)]
*  There's a photo of it. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7021.2s)]
*  I'm 99% sure I put it on my Instagram. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7022.2s)]
*  But he's sitting there and you're like, how are you doing that? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7024.2s)]
*  That's not even possible. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7027.2s)]
*  Because he's not very big, right? [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7028.2s)]
*  No. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7029.2s)]
*  Well, he's thin, but he's like very ripped. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7030.2s)]
*  You know, like you see him without a shirt on. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7034.2s)]
*  You would go, what is this guy eating? [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7036.2s)]
*  Oh, only pizza. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7037.2s)]
*  Pizza and spaghetti. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7039.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's pasta. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7040.2s)]
*  He's fucking shredded. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7042.2s)]
*  Is he pretty young? [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7043.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's like 20. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7044.2s)]
*  He lives in Singapore now and he's competing for one for one championship. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7045.2s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7049.2s)]
*  They're doing legitimate grabbing. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7050.2s)]
*  Start making some money. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7051.2s)]
*  Do I have it on my phone maybe? [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7052.2s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7055.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's good for those guys to start making money. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7056.2s)]
*  I just am so curious where jiu jitsu is going to go. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7058.2s)]
*  What month was that, Jamie, that he was here? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7060.2s)]
*  Do you know that? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7062.2s)]
*  No, it's when I got COVID. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7063.2s)]
*  Oh, was it? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7064.2s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7065.2s)]
*  Was that when you got COVID the second time? [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7066.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7068.2s)]
*  Did you get COVID at all? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7069.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7071.2s)]
*  I definitely feel like I had the symptoms at one point. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7072.2s)]
*  I know I got tested once. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7074.2s)]
*  It's a negative. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7075.2s)]
*  I never took a positive test to confirm I've had it or not. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7076.2s)]
*  So you didn't have a hard go of it? [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7078.2s)]
*  Dude, yeah, my life didn't change at all. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7080.2s)]
*  Those whole two years, I bought a cage, put it in a warehouse. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7082.2s)]
*  We trained, nothing was going on, fought in the UFC three times. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7085.2s)]
*  It was just, Dana's such a legend for doing that. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7089.2s)]

*  Now, after this I want you to try this. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7148.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7151.2s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7152.2s)]
*  His feet are on the ground. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7155.2s)]
*  His butt's on the ground. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7157.2s)]
*  And his feet are touching. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7159.2s)]
*  His knees are touching each other in the middle. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7160.2s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7162.2s)]
*  I was trying to picture it when you were saying it. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7163.2s)]
*  Bro, what is that? [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7165.2s)]
*  How is that possible? [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7166.2s)]
*  How can you do that? [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7167.2s)]
*  That's some weird knee dexterity. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7168.2s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7170.2s)]
*  Weird everything dexterity. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7171.2s)]
*  Look at how his knees are going back sideways. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7172.2s)]
*  And his feet are almost flat. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7174.2s)]
*  I would tap. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7175.2s)]
*  If you put my knee in that position, the right knee, I would tap. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7176.2s)]
*  I'd be like, I'm tapping. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7180.2s)]
*  He's touching his quads to each other. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7181.2s)]
*  Dude, that's nuts. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7183.2s)]
*  On the top. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7184.2s)]
*  That's absolutely nuts. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7185.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucking weird. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7186.2s)]
*  It doesn't seem like you should be able to sit like that. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7187.2s)]
*  And he was just doing that to be comfortable. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7189.2s)]
*  To be comfortable. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7190.2s)]
*  He just sat down. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7191.2s)]
*  He just sat down. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7192.2s)]
*  He just sat down and he was looking at his phone. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7194.2s)]
*  And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing, Mikey? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7196.2s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7199.2s)]
*  How do you sit like that? [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7200.2s)]
*  Have you ever seen anybody that can do that? [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7203.2s)]
*  When I was seven, there were some kids that sat weird like that. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7205.2s)]
*  Double-jointed. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7209.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7210.2s)]
*  Little kids that were super weird like that. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7211.2s)]
*  Yeah, but not like world jujitsu champions. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7212.2s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7214.2s)]
*  His feet on the ground, though, too. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7215.2s)]
*  Bro, when he gets mount on people, it's like he's got arms. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7216.2s)]
*  It's like he's got two giant arms down where his legs should be that are holding people down. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7218.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's got to benefit your jujitsu for sure. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7223.2s)]
*  For sure. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7226.2s)]
*  He probably can sit like that because of jujitsu. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7227.2s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7228.2s)]
*  Just constantly on the mat. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7229.2s)]
*  He's been doing jujitsu since he was a little kid. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7230.2s)]
*  And he's another one. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7232.2s)]
*  He's a seven-day-a-week, 12-hour-a-day guy. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7233.2s)]
*  He's nuts, man, with it. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7236.2s)]
*  His approach is super interesting. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7237.2s)]
*  The guys he trains with, the hobbyists. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7239.2s)]
*  Look at this flexibility, too. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7241.2s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7243.2s)]
*  His hands are over his feet? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7244.2s)]
*  That's weird. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7245.2s)]
*  That's fucked. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7246.2s)]
*  His feet are in his elbows almost. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7247.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know how that's possible. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7249.2s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7251.2s)]
*  Anatomically, I don't know how that's possible. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7252.2s)]
*  Do you even stretch, bro? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7254.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's insane. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7255.2s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if that's jeans, too. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7257.2s)]
*  I mean, I just get this like... [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7259.2s)]
*  You know, having that kind of flexibility and leg dexterity [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7261.2s)]
*  is so important in grappling. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7264.2s)]
*  Eddie Bravo has the craziest flexibility. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7266.2s)]
*  Still, even? [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7269.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7270.2s)]
*  Really? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7271.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's got knee problems and shit. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7272.2s)]
*  He's had some meniscus tears and shit. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7273.2s)]
*  100% of people that sit that way. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7275.2s)]
*  Yeah, and, oh, fuck. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7277.2s)]
*  But that's not the same thing he's doing. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7278.2s)]
*  That's not as bad, though. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7279.2s)]
*  That's not what he was doing. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7280.2s)]
*  Because he's got his knees spread apart. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7281.2s)]
*  The other one, his feet were on the ground, [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7282.2s)]
*  and his legs were touching in the center, which is insane. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7284.2s)]
*  That's different. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7286.2s)]
*  I can sit like that. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7287.2s)]
*  That's way different. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7288.2s)]
*  I can sit like that. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7289.2s)]
*  That other shit was preposterous. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7290.2s)]
*  His feet were flat on the ground. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7292.2s)]
*  It's like your knee would fucking just pop or some shit. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7294.2s)]
*  It's not supposed to be there. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7296.2s)]
*  Well, if you can get your body to be that flexible, though, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7298.2s)]
*  and then have dexterity like that, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7301.2s)]
*  you could do so much shit off your back. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7303.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7305.2s)]
*  You know, you can do so much stuff with guard techniques. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7306.2s)]
*  Guys who have like really... [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7310.2s)]
*  Like, that was a BJ Penn thing, too. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7312.2s)]
*  BJ was crazy flexible. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7313.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7315.2s)]
*  You know, and if you're with a guy, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7316.2s)]
*  and you get on top of a guy, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7318.2s)]
*  and all of a sudden you're in a terrible position, [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7320.2s)]
*  like, there's certain guys, if you are on your back, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7322.2s)]
*  and you're trying... [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7325.2s)]
*  Like, Fabricio Verdun. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7327.2s)]
*  If you were in that guy's guard, you're in deep shit. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7329.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7331.2s)]
*  That guy fucking tapped everybody. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7332.2s)]
*  Think of who Fabricio Verdun tapped. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7333.2s)]
*  He tapped Minotauro. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7335.2s)]
*  He tapped Cain Velasquez. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7337.2s)]
*  He tapped Fedor when Fedor was Fedor. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7339.2s)]
*  Fuck. That's crazy. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7342.2s)]
*  He tapped Fedor in his fucking prime. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7343.2s)]
*  When Fedor was a murderer. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7345.2s)]
*  Damn. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7347.2s)]
*  And he caught him in a triangle. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7348.2s)]
*  Did he retire? [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7349.2s)]
*  Fabricio? [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7351.2s)]
*  I don't know what Fabricio is doing. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7352.2s)]
*  He's not in the UFC anymore. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7354.2s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7355.2s)]
*  Let's see what he's up to. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7356.2s)]
*  Somewhere else. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7357.2s)]
*  Fucking Boxing Floyd next or something. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7358.2s)]
*  I don't know what he's doing. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7360.2s)]
*  I don't know what he's doing. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7361.2s)]
*  But, you know, when you talk about legends, [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7362.2s)]
*  you've got to include Fabricio Verdun, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7363.2s)]
*  because that guy tapped everybody. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7365.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7366.2s)]
*  He tapped all the killers. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7367.2s)]
*  Especially Cain. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7368.2s)]
*  Like, that was... [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7369.2s)]
*  Yeah. I remember he tapped Cain. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7370.2s)]
*  That was the only one I would watch, but that was crazy. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7371.2s)]
*  And that was one where it was in Mexico City. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7372.2s)]
*  And Cain didn't adequately prepare for the altitude. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7375.2s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7378.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7379.2s)]
*  He had went out early. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7380.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7381.2s)]
*  Verdun went to the mountains. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7382.2s)]
*  And he was there for, like, months. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7384.2s)]
*  He was there for several months. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7386.2s)]
*  I'll never fight in altitude. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7388.2s)]
*  That's crazy altitude. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7389.2s)]
*  I'll never do it. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7390.2s)]
*  It's also Mexico City, which is wildly polluted. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7391.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7394.2s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7395.2s)]
*  The air quality... [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7396.2s)]
*  Dude, I took photos when we were landing my airplane. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7397.2s)]
*  And it's insane. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7401.2s)]
*  It looks like there's a fire. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7402.2s)]
*  Like, way worse... [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7403.2s)]
*  I mean, LA, even, when you come in, it looks disgusting. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7404.2s)]
*  It's way worse than LA. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7406.2s)]
*  Way worse than LA. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7407.2s)]
*  Whoo! [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7408.2s)]
*  I think I wrote on Instagram, this is LA in the future. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7409.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's probably a good way to look at it. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7411.2s)]
*  It's when you have just complete, like, people are like, [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7414.2s)]
*  oh, the regulations ruin everything. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7416.2s)]
*  Look at what happens when you don't have regulated air quality. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7419.2s)]
*  You don't have, like, regulated emission standards. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7423.2s)]
*  Like, that is fucking important, kids. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7425.2s)]
*  Those poor people that live there that probably don't even know any better, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7428.2s)]
*  that just fucking... [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7431.2s)]
*  Of course they don't know. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7432.2s)]
*  You don't even notice it when you're in there. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7433.2s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7434.2s)]
*  Just flying in. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7435.2s)]
*  Yeah, flying in, you see it. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7436.2s)]
*  But once you're in the city, you're just in the city. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7438.2s)]
*  It's just like, the air quality's terrible. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7440.2s)]
*  So these people, they just get accustomed to it. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7442.2s)]
*  See if you can find those photos. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7444.2s)]
*  Like, I took a photo of flying in from Mexico City. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7445.2s)]
*  Damn. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7449.2s)]
*  But it's a terrible place to be out of gas. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7450.2s)]
*  If you're a fighter and you're in Mexico City and you're tired, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7456.2s)]
*  whoo, that will test you. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7459.2s)]
*  That's the worst thing. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7461.2s)]
*  That's a fighter's biggest fear, is literally just gassing out. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7462.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7465.2s)]
*  Like, that's the fucking most terrifying thing. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7466.2s)]
*  Look at that photo. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7467.2s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7468.2s)]
*  And that's just a normal fucking day, huh? [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7469.2s)]
*  That's a normal day. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7472.2s)]
*  Regular day. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7473.2s)]
*  That's not a fire. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7474.2s)]
*  That's so fucked up. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7475.2s)]
*  Bro, it was so fucked up when we were flying in. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7477.2s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7479.2s)]
*  And I didn't want to say anything. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7481.2s)]
*  I didn't want to freak out anybody on the plane. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7482.2s)]
*  But I wanted to be like, if I was with a friend, [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7484.2s)]
*  I'd probably be like, bro, what the fuck are they breathing? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7487.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's disgusting. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7490.2s)]
*  What are these people breathing? [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7491.2s)]
*  That's just insane. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7492.2s)]
*  Just walking around with a portal air filter around you at all times. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7493.2s)]
*  Yeah, what the fuck? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7496.2s)]
*  I mean, that shit takes years off your life. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7497.2s)]
*  Like, they know that's true. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7499.2s)]
*  They know that people that live in big cities, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7500.2s)]
*  they have a decreased life expectancy due to the effects of all the pollution. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7502.2s)]
*  Did you ever watch the, I know there was Narcos, the Columbia one. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7506.2s)]
*  Did you ever watch El Chapo on Netflix? [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7509.2s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7512.2s)]
*  It was fucked so good. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7513.2s)]
*  Is it a documentary? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7514.2s)]
*  It was, no, it was like a series. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7515.2s)]
*  Oh, all on Chapo? [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7518.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's so crazy. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7520.2s)]
*  I was watching them, like, you couldn't make that up. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7521.2s)]
*  And like, that's real fucking shit. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7524.2s)]
*  How about the fact that Sean Penn goes over there and interviews? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7527.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7530.2s)]
*  What balls does Sean Penn have? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7531.2s)]
*  Sean Penn goes and interviews him there. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7535.2s)]
*  And then in the middle of the Ukraine war with Russia, flies to Ukraine. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7537.2s)]
*  Wait, do you have him on? [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7542.2s)]
*  No, I've never had him on. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7543.2s)]

*  It wasn't Lex. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7550.2s)]
*  It was the guy who got out of jail. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7551.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7554.2s)]

*  I don't know what it was. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7642.2s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7643.2s)]
*  I don't know what it was, but that's straight insanity. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7644.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's so sad. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7645.2s)]
*  Like, if you want us to be sympathetic, that is the wrong way. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7646.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7647.2s)]
*  Like, if you want to like fire people up to the fact that you have a totally cruel and [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7648.2s)]
*  evil heart, you're going to have to be a little bit more of a bitch. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7652.2s)]
*  that's running your country that's willing to take some innocent woman and use her as [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7656.2s)]
*  a pawn politically and put her in a penal colony. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7662.2s)]
*  And if that's just the laws over there, that's our laws. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7666.2s)]
*  Well, those laws suck. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7669.2s)]
*  Those laws fucking suck. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7672.2s)]
*  You got a law like that where you have a vape pen and you go to a penal colony? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7675.2s)]
*  That's justice? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7681.2s)]
*  Like, how do you want the world to be sympathetic to you when you'll take some woman who's a [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7683.2s)]
*  professional athlete and a basketball player, and especially when it's something like cannabis. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7687.2s)]
*  Like, you know there's health benefits to that, particularly for athletes. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7692.2s)]
*  For athletes, it reduces inflammation. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7696.2s)]
*  A lot of athletes like to smoke weed. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7698.2s)]
*  It's not bad for you. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7700.2s)]
*  And it's not bad for the culture and bad for people. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7701.2s)]
*  So like, why are you putting her in a penal colony? [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7704.2s)]
*  I mean, it's no different than coffee. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7707.2s)]
*  It's just kind of the opposite. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7709.2s)]
*  Coffee, you know, you drink in the morning, get jazzed up, weed, smoke, kind of shows [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7710.2s)]
*  you how it makes you think a little different. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7713.2s)]
*  Unless you get ahold of one of them Joey Diaz stars of death. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7715.2s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7718.2s)]
*  Russia said the chances of a prisoner swap for Brittany Griner had strengthened and is [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7719.2s)]
*  angling to get a notorious arms dealer freed. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7723.2s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7726.2s)]
*  Man. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7727.2s)]
*  What the fuck? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7728.2s)]
*  If we give up a basketball player for a mass murderer. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7729.2s)]
*  I mean, is he a mass murderer or is he just an arms dealer? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7733.2s)]
*  He didn't do anything. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7737.2s)]
*  He just sold them to people that killed me. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7738.2s)]
*  He's like, hey, bro, I'm basically like fucking a bad guy. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7740.2s)]
*  Chester or something. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7744.2s)]
*  I'm just selling shit. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7745.2s)]
*  Do you think if you make drugs legal, there'll be more less people dying like from fentanyl [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7747.2s)]
*  is just but there's more addicts or do you think it's crazy how these people are all [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7753.2s)]
*  these people are dying. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7759.2s)]
*  It's not they're risking it knowing that fentanyl just a little bit of fentanyl could be in [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7760.2s)]
*  there. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7764.2s)]
*  But if it's legal and it's regulated, then you get whatever you're trying to get. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7765.2s)]
*  There's no fentanyl in it. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7769.2s)]
*  You know that. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7770.2s)]
*  Are you going to have people more addicted because it's easier accessible but less deaths? [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7771.2s)]
*  Or do you think that it's going to benefit just like less deaths and less crime? [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7776.2s)]
*  I hate to make this quote again, but Thomas Sowell had this thing. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7784.2s)]
*  There's no solutions. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7788.2s)]
*  It just compromises. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7789.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7790.2s)]
*  That's fucking accurate. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7791.2s)]
*  And in these situations, these complex situations like drugs, if you do make drugs legal, for [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7792.2s)]
*  sure people are going to die. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7798.2s)]
*  But for sure people are going to get hooked on them that wouldn't have tried them before [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7800.2s)]
*  because now they have easy access. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7804.2s)]
*  And I think it'll take a while until it gets to the kind of same baseline of people who [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7806.2s)]
*  abuse or don't abuse things. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7812.2s)]
*  And maybe because the stigma and like the mystery of it all because it's illegal will [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7814.2s)]
*  go away if you know what it is and that it's damaging. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7820.2s)]
*  And maybe they could stop more people from having overdoses and with either counseling [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7823.2s)]
*  or medication like Narcon, that stuff that they give people when they do have an overdose, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7832.2s)]
*  if they have that more readily available. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7837.2s)]
*  If they have detox clinics, they take some of the money from legal sales and they create [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7839.2s)]
*  these detox clinics and these clinics along with like counseling, help people that have [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7843.2s)]
*  drug addictions. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7848.2s)]
*  But it's like who gets to decide what you can and cannot do with your body? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7849.2s)]
*  If you want to like give that up to the state, well, they're not good at managing anything. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7857.2s)]
*  Why would they be good at managing your consciousness, managing your choices, what you can and can't [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7861.2s)]
*  do with your body? [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7865.2s)]
*  A lot of them have terrible bodies. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7866.2s)]
*  They don't even know. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7868.2s)]
*  They don't know what they, you know, you can't tell people they can't take peptides or you [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7869.2s)]
*  can't tell people they can't smoke weed. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7875.2s)]
*  You can't, you don't even know what those things do. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7877.2s)]
*  Like if you didn't smoke weed and you were saying you got to stop smoking weed, like [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7880.2s)]
*  you're not qualified to make that statement. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7884.2s)]
*  You don't even know how good it is. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7886.2s)]
*  You don't know what the benefits it serves. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7887.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7890.2s)]
*  I think less crime too. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7892.2s)]
*  I bet probably overall less crime eventually. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7894.2s)]
*  Yeah, eventually. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7897.2s)]
*  But there's going to be some chaotic moments. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7898.2s)]
*  That's like what I said, like some people are going to die. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7900.2s)]
*  But I think like overwhelmingly in the long run, less people will die because if you know [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7902.2s)]
*  what you're getting, if you want, if you're trying to get ecstasy and someone gives you [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7907.2s)]
*  fentanyl and you die, that is fucked up. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7910.2s)]
*  So fucked up. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7913.2s)]
*  But if you want to get ecstasy and you get ecstasy and you have your time of your life, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7914.2s)]
*  like that's, that's a different thing. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7917.2s)]
*  You know, like we try to pretend that people don't enjoy themselves when they're on ecstasy. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7920.2s)]
*  It's not helping anything. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7924.2s)]
*  You're not helping anybody. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7925.2s)]
*  I don't think the thing is to like make it illegal and keep it so that only drug dealers [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7926.2s)]
*  are selling you this stuff through illegal methods where they can be locked up in jail forever. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7931.2s)]
*  So only the craziest motherfuckers are doing it. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7935.2s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7938.2s)]
*  And that's not a solution. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7939.2s)]
*  That's not a solution to a real supply demand and also an ethics question. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7941.2s)]
*  Because who the fuck are you to tell me what I can't do, especially if you're talking about pure stuff. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7945.2s)]
*  You know, like I've never done coke, but I know a lot of people who like it. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7953.2s)]
*  And if you do it now, you run a real risk that you might die because the shit is spiked with fentanyl. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7957.2s)]
*  It's a real risk. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7964.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7965.2s)]
*  But if you had legal coke, you wouldn't have to worry about that at all. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7966.2s)]
*  If it was just like buying a six pack, you go to a store, show your license, they give you coke. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7970.2s)]
*  I wonder if more or less people would do it. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7976.2s)]
*  I wonder if people would recognize the problems with it. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7979.2s)]
*  Just like some people quit drinking, just like some people decide to be healthier. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7981.2s)]
*  They quit sugar. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7985.2s)]
*  They quit this. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7986.2s)]
*  They know. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7987.2s)]
*  They know it's bad for you now. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7988.2s)]
*  So they quit. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7989.2s)]
*  If it's like there's a mystery to it being illegal, we're going to be we're going to be naughty when you get this illegal drug in other countries like where alcohol is. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=7990.2s)]
*  You could drink alcohol when you're young. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8001.2s)]
*  If you go to Italy, you don't see a bunch of like young teenage drunks. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8002.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8005.2s)]
*  They start drinking wine. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8006.2s)]
*  They're like six years old. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8008.2s)]
*  Nobody gives a shit about it. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8009.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8011.2s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8012.2s)]
*  No worries, man. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8014.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's I mean, it's crazy how people have they can say you can and can't do things like if you're at home. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8015.2s)]
*  It shouldn't matter. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8023.2s)]
*  You could do what you should be able to do. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8024.2s)]
*  Whatever the fuck you want, whatever you feel like doing, not hurting anybody else, whatever the fuck you want to take, whatever you want to the moon. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8026.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8032.2s)]
*  Or even go to the club. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8033.2s)]
*  You want to have a little extra something, a little extra fun time. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8034.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8037.2s)]
*  Should be able to. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8038.2s)]
*  It should be legal and regulated where you know what it is, where they do tests on it. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8039.2s)]
*  They they have labs that are certified. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8043.2s)]
*  If they did that, we'd have tax money from it. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8045.2s)]
*  Instead, the what we know is billions and billions of dollars people spend every year on illegal drugs. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8048.2s)]
*  Let's just guess. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8054.2s)]
*  Let's just guess. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8055.2s)]
*  Sean O'Malley. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8056.2s)]
*  How many how much money spent on illegal drugs? [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8057.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8060.2s)]
*  What do you guess? [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8061.2s)]
*  In America or just all over? [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8062.2s)]
*  Let's just say America. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8063.2s)]
*  America. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8064.2s)]
*  How much does America spend on illegal drugs every year? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8065.2s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8068.2s)]
*  I'm going to say 10. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8070.2s)]
*  We'll go five billion. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8071.2s)]
*  Five billion sounds good. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8074.2s)]
*  I'm going to play it a little under that. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8075.2s)]
*  I'm going to go with four billion. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8077.2s)]
*  OK. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8078.2s)]
*  You guys are way off. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8080.2s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8082.2s)]
*  What's the number? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8083.2s)]
*  One hundred and fifty billion. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8084.2s)]
*  What? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8086.2s)]
*  Are you serious? [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8087.2s)]
*  Shit. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8088.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8089.2s)]
*  Americans are spending one hundred and fifty billion annually on illicit drugs. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8090.2s)]
*  Appears to rival what is spent on alcohol. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8097.2s)]
*  Spending on cannabis, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine by Americans reached a nearly one hundred and fifty billion. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8100.2s)]
*  You know what they noticed? [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8107.2s)]
*  You know what they left out? [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8108.2s)]
*  Mushrooms. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8110.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8111.2s)]
*  Mushrooms goes under the radar. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8112.2s)]
*  It does. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8114.2s)]
*  One hundred and fifty billion. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8115.2s)]
*  Mushrooms is such a different drug. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8116.2s)]
*  That should be legal. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8119.2s)]
*  It should. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8120.2s)]
*  One hundred percent that should be legal. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8121.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8122.2s)]
*  You should doubt. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8123.2s)]
*  One hundred percent mushrooms should be legal and they should be given to soldiers and anybody [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8124.2s)]
*  with PTSD and people that are dying from cancer and helps them to like at the end of life therapy. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8128.2s)]
*  It's like one of the most beneficial things for people. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8134.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8136.2s)]
*  The size of retail heroin market is now closer to the size of marijuana market than it is [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8137.2s)]
*  to the other drugs according to the analysis. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8144.2s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8146.2s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8147.2s)]
*  That's so sad. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8148.2s)]
*  The retail heroin market is close to marijuana? [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8150.2s)]
*  What is the retail heroin market? [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8156.2s)]
*  Is that just like legal opium? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8157.2s)]
*  You know how crazy it is? [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8159.2s)]
*  Because what's crazy is marijuana is like the most innocuous in most people's eyes, the [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8160.2s)]
*  most prevalent, the most where people won't like thumb their nose at you. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8165.2s)]
*  You tell your friends you do heroin, they're going to go, oh Jesus, Sean, what are you [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8169.2s)]
*  doing? [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8173.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8174.2s)]
*  You tell your friend you smuggled a little weed, they're like, hey, who doesn't? [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8175.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8178.2s)]
*  So the fact that they're closing in on marijuana. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8179.2s)]
*  Trying to find out what it says it is. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8183.2s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8186.2s)]
*  That's bananas. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8187.2s)]
*  Well, even when you think about Chapo or Pablo, how much money those guys were fucking raking [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8188.2s)]
*  in. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8191.2s)]
*  This is the point. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8192.2s)]
*  If drugs are illegal, it's not stopping people from buying drugs, it's just giving all the [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8193.2s)]
*  money to criminals. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8197.2s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8198.2s)]
*  Like that's $150 billion that we could be using to clean up schools and neighborhoods. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8199.2s)]
*  And just think of the revenue that comes from that. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8204.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8207.2s)]
*  And marijuana changed the game too, taxing it. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8208.2s)]
*  Yeah, if they sold it and made it expensive and taxed it highly and then made it so there's [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8211.2s)]
*  like fucking crisis hotlines on everything. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8217.2s)]
*  But at least you would know if you're getting heroin that you're actually getting heroin. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8219.2s)]
*  You would know that if you're getting marijuana, you're actually getting marijuana. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8223.2s)]
*  You know if it's cocaine. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8226.2s)]
*  It's like if the government wants to regulate, do that. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8227.2s)]
*  Make some money. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8230.2s)]
*  You guys, stop making shit illegal. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8231.2s)]
*  Biden administration was supposed to make it legal. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8234.2s)]
*  Remember that? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8236.2s)]
*  They were like, we are going to let all those people that are in federal prison for marijuana [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8237.2s)]
*  possession, we're going to let them out. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8244.2s)]
*  There's no one in federal prison for marijuana possession. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8245.2s)]
*  I heard you and Duncan talking about that. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8248.2s)]
*  He was like, I support it. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8252.2s)]
*  I liked it. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8254.2s)]
*  I fucking thumbs up it or whatever he said. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8255.2s)]
*  Yeah, he tricked us. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8256.2s)]
*  And then you realize it's fucking actually no one. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8257.2s)]
*  Duncan's an interesting, I always love listening when he comes on here. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8259.2s)]
*  He's just so fucking funny. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8263.2s)]
*  When he goes off on his tangents and it's just so fun to listen to. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8265.2s)]
*  Yeah, we always have a new outfit too. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8269.2s)]
*  Last time we were clowns and what was hilarious, we were dressed as clowns and Fox News was [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8271.2s)]
*  playing a clip of me and Duncan while we were dressed like clowns. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8277.2s)]
*  They have to say, well, they were dressed up for Halloween. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8281.2s)]
*  Sort of. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8284.2s)]
*  You dress up every time. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8285.2s)]
*  Every time he's on, we're like, you know, for 4th of July, we dressed up like patriots. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8287.2s)]
*  We dressed up. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8293.2s)]
*  That's what we do. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8294.2s)]
*  We put the crazy wigs on with the wizards. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8295.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8297.2s)]
*  We got to come up with a new outfit. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8298.2s)]
*  Astronauts. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8300.2s)]
*  That shit's funny. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8301.2s)]
*  It's new costume ideas. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8303.2s)]
*  But yeah, Duncan and I did a show last night in Austin. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8305.2s)]
*  Does he live here? [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8308.2s)]
*  Yeah, Duncan's here. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8310.2s)]
*  Yeah, Duncan moved here. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8311.2s)]
*  This is one of his better outfits. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8312.2s)]
*  Yeah, you wore a ghillie suit with a face mask. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8314.2s)]
*  Didn't he try talking with it for a while? [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8318.2s)]
*  Yeah, he did for a while. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8321.2s)]
*  It was like, it was too crazy. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8322.2s)]
*  But that was during the height of the pandemic too. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8323.2s)]
*  There was certain people that were upset that we were doing podcasts and we weren't wearing masks on the podcast. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8326.2s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8332.2s)]
*  That was a thing, man. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8333.2s)]
*  Yeah, they told on us. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8334.2s)]
*  The health department came and visited us. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8336.2s)]
*  No way. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8338.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8339.2s)]
*  Actually. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8340.2s)]
*  What? [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8341.2s)]
*  I mean, meanwhile we were testing. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8342.2s)]
*  I was like, dude, we're testing everybody. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8343.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8344.2s)]
*  And they're like, you can't, you know, you have to do this. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8345.2s)]
*  You have to stay apart from each other and you have to have signs up. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8347.2s)]
*  So we have to have signs up like stand six feet apart. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8349.2s)]
*  And we had a bag of masks. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8352.2s)]
*  Some common sense rules and laws are just, it's like, holy fuck. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8353.2s)]
*  Do you still, you still overeat when you go out to eat much? [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8357.2s)]
*  And they've talked about it and I fucking resonated with that so much. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8361.2s)]
*  Like if I get high before I go out to eat, like, and I'm getting a good cheeseburger, [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8364.2s)]
*  like I might as well order two because I'm going to eat that one and I'm going to be hungry still. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8367.2s)]
*  I'm not even going to fucking touch my, like, doesn't even faze me. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8371.2s)]
*  Gluttony. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8373.2s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8374.2s)]
*  It's such a pain in the ass. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8375.2s)]
*  It's such a pain in the ass. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8376.2s)]
*  When you're always dieting and cutting weight, do you think that makes you like more prone to doing that? [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8377.2s)]
*  Dude, look at the reason Patty the baddie gets as big as he is because it's like you get this mental disorder. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8382.2s)]
*  I strict as fuck for about 10 weeks before that fight. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8387.2s)]
*  Like I'd have a little cheat meal on a Saturday, but the closer they got to the fight, four or five weeks out, [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8392.2s)]
*  I was just eating so clean to wear right after. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8396.2s)]
*  It's like I'll order two cheeseburgers, fucking some appetizers and just eat until I'm so uncomfortable [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8399.2s)]
*  and so much pain. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8405.2s)]
*  Oh my God, look at Patty. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8406.2s)]
*  I'm going to send you a video, Jamie, this dude posted today. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8407.2s)]
*  Yeah, Patty's, and I'm not, who am I to fucking say, but I just, I mean I know that's just not good for you. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8411.2s)]
*  He gets up to 200 pounds. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8417.2s)]
*  That's like me getting up to like 190 or 185. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8420.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot, dude. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8425.2s)]
*  It's sad. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8426.2s)]
*  It's like, that's not good. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8427.2s)]
*  But it gives you this mental disorder from eating. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8428.2s)]
*  But fuck, dude, if you take a couple puffs before dinner, it depends on how high you get. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8431.2s)]
*  There's levels of high. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8436.2s)]
*  If you just get a nice little high and the food just tastes better and you can really enjoy it, [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8437.2s)]
*  or you get too high and you go in there and you just feel like a bottomless pit [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8441.2s)]
*  and you're eating the fucking bread and the appetizers, then you're eating your fucking other appetizers, [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8445.2s)]
*  then you're getting fucking two cheeseburgers. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8450.2s)]
*  It's bad sometimes. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8453.2s)]
*  Michael Easter was actually just talking about that. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8455.2s)]
*  He's a guy who wrote this book, The Comfort Crisis, [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8457.2s)]
*  and he wrote this book about a study that they did where they took these guys [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8461.2s)]
*  and they purposely starved them. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8465.2s)]
*  Play it so he could say it. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8466.2s)]
*  Michael underscore Easter. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8470.2s)]
*  It's over. Scientists had to call it off. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8472.2s)]
*  So in that study I talked about a few weeks ago, they took 36 men, [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8473.2s)]
*  they put them in a lab for six months and they starved them, like really starved them [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8477.2s)]
*  because they wanted to know what happens to the human body when we significantly decrease our calories [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8480.2s)]
*  and lose a lot of weight, what happens to our bodies, what happens to our minds, [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8485.2s)]
*  what happens to all these different processes. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8489.2s)]
*  So it was a really enlightening study, told us a lot about weight loss, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8491.2s)]
*  but where it started to get interesting is that now they have to re-feed these guys [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8494.2s)]
*  and bring them back up to a normal weight. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8497.2s)]
*  And the impacts of the weight loss were very lasting on these guys' behavior. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8499.2s)]
*  So for one, they binge ate. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8504.2s)]
*  One guy ate 11,000 calories a day. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8506.2s)]
*  He had to go to the hospital for eating so much in a meal, [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8509.2s)]
*  and all of them were eating significantly higher calories than when they started. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8512.2s)]
*  Second is that they had obsessed about food. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8516.2s)]
*  It was on their mind all the time, just as it had been when they were starving. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8518.2s)]
*  And there's a handful of other really fascinating things that happened [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8522.2s)]
*  that basically ended up bringing these guys above the weight that they started at. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8525.2s)]
*  So after this crazy diet, they actually ended up heavier. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8530.2s)]
*  This can tell us a lot about diets today, how we should approach them, [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8534.2s)]
*  how we should think about eating normally once we've lost weight. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8538.2s)]
*  There's a link in the bio if you want to learn more. Check it out. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8541.2s)]
*  I love Michael, but hey man, that fucking, the voiceover, the captions, [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8544.2s)]
*  it's like missing all these words. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8549.2s)]
*  I know, that was weird. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8551.2s)]
*  Like, that's the worst transcription ever. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8552.2s)]
*  It's doing it for free. If you had to pay someone to do that. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8555.2s)]
*  Well, pay for it. Because what is this? [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8557.2s)]
*  You're cutting off all these words. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8560.2s)]
*  What's the purpose of having it so you can read it if you can't read it? [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8562.2s)]
*  If you're not listening to him and you're reading that, you're like, what is he saying? [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8566.2s)]
*  He's missing like key words. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8569.2s)]
*  It's also better than not having it? [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8572.2s)]
*  Incorrect. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8574.2s)]
*  What's just him making it sitting on his chair? [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8575.2s)]
*  The new tax of weight loss were, what does that mean? [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8577.2s)]
*  And guys' behavior. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8580.2s)]
*  So for one, they binge ate, let's say, and then it gets to this other one. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8581.2s)]
*  See here? And he had to go to the hospital for eating, eating what? [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8585.2s)]
*  And all of them were eating significantly what? [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8589.2s)]
*  Than when they started. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8591.2s)]
*  What? [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8592.2s)]
*  What if you can't hear and you can only read? [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8593.2s)]
*  It's better than not having it? [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8595.2s)]
*  It's fucked. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8596.2s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8597.2s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8598.2s)]
*  No, it's even it's better to not have it than to have it where you can't fucking read it because there's a bunch of words missing. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8599.2s)]
*  Have you ever watched captions normally? [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8607.2s)]
*  They are about not that good. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8608.2s)]
*  That's that's not that bad. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8610.2s)]
*  That's pretty bad. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8611.2s)]
*  Whatever program he's using that program sucks. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8612.2s)]
*  Maybe he didn't know. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8615.2s)]
*  Instagram. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8616.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably just like a building. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8617.2s)]
*  But interesting study. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8618.2s)]
*  That bad? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8619.2s)]
*  Yeah, very interesting. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8620.2s)]
*  That's a dude. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8622.2s)]
*  That's the it's so true. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8623.2s)]
*  Every fighter will sit here and say the same thing after fight. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8625.2s)]
*  If you'd cut a lot of weight and you make weight and then I mean even for me, I still eat really clean leading up to the fight. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8627.2s)]
*  But dude, I see fighters at the fucking breakfast buffet eating pink like eating shitty fight day because they made weight or after the after weigh-ins that night. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8634.2s)]
*  They're eating shitty. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8641.2s)]
*  They just want to eat. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8642.2s)]
*  I keep it clean all the way until after the fight. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8643.2s)]
*  Then after the fight, I let loose a little bit. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8645.2s)]
*  But this has been the best I've done. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8647.2s)]
*  Usually because for me, bread, cheese causes inflammation like I work with a nutritionist, Dan Garner. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8648.2s)]
*  We do he's working on a really, really cool protocol right now, a concussion protocol for me. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8655.2s)]
*  He's done 10 plus labs for me. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8659.2s)]
*  I've been working with him for like five years. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8663.2s)]
*  He has a ton of data on me. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8664.2s)]
*  But we do a bunch of like right now will be in. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8666.2s)]
*  He's making a protocol for me outside of camp to eat. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8669.2s)]
*  So he has all my all my data. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8672.2s)]
*  But I've been doing a really good job not overeating this each time it gets a little bit better. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8674.2s)]
*  And it's just it's a knowledge thing and a discipline thing. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8679.2s)]
*  Does he meal prep for you? [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8682.2s)]
*  So he makes you he he lives in Canada. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8684.2s)]
*  He writes it out. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8686.2s)]
*  I have a meal prep company in Arizona, all organics that makes my food. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8687.2s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8692.2s)]
*  The entire fight camp. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8693.2s)]
*  So they give you the exact portions that you need. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8694.2s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8696.2s)]
*  Changed the game. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8697.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8698.2s)]
*  I know how to think about it. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8699.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8700.2s)]
*  I don't really cook. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8701.2s)]
*  Danny cooked. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8702.2s)]
*  She would, you know, full time mom and she does hair for a living. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8703.2s)]
*  So she'd work a couple of days a week. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8705.2s)]
*  Besides the other recharge center in Arizona, they fucking it changed the game. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8707.2s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8712.2s)]
*  But this this one, I mean, I got out of this camp or out of that fight and I was like, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8713.2s)]
*  I'm ready to go. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8718.2s)]
*  I want to fucking get back to the gym. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8719.2s)]
*  I know how hard of a fight Henry is, how hard of a fight. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8720.2s)]
*  Aljo is a heart of a fight. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8723.2s)]
*  Anybody in the top five is I need to get back to the gym. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8724.2s)]
*  So, you know, I've been really a lot more disciplined. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8727.2s)]
*  These things been a month now since the fight, but not eating as much cheese and or eating as much bread. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8730.2s)]
*  If I go out, go out to eat just because I know that fucking causes inflammation in my body. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8735.2s)]
*  And I know it's going to make take a little bit longer to get back to training or if I am training and I eat, [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8740.2s)]
*  you know, too much cheese and bread, it's going to cause that inflammation, risk an injury or just be fucking more sore than I need to be. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8745.2s)]
*  But yeah, eating disorder from cutting weight is a real fucking problem. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8752.2s)]
*  It's a real thing, right? [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8757.2s)]
*  If I fought in my natural weight class, I'd fight at 155. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8758.2s)]
*  If I didn't cut weight, walk around 58, 59, whatever, I'd fight at 155. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8762.2s)]
*  There's no fucking chance that I'm going to say, you know what, I'm just going to do that. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8766.2s)]
*  I'm going to go fight Justin Gaethje. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8769.2s)]
*  I'm going to fight Charles. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8771.2s)]
*  Like there's no way I could go fight at 145. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8773.2s)]
*  I believe in be successful. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8775.2s)]
*  I'm not a tiny 35 or those guys would still even be a little bit bigger. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8777.2s)]
*  But cut into 45, I wouldn't cut into 35 fucking hard. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8780.2s)]
*  You feel like you're dying. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8783.2s)]
*  Your heart is pounding. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8785.2s)]
*  You're laying in bed. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8787.2s)]
*  You kind of are dying. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8788.2s)]
*  You 100 percent are dying. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8789.2s)]
*  Like I talked to my body. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8791.2s)]
*  I have to tell it like, hey, you know, we're going what we're doing fight week. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8793.2s)]
*  Like we're going to start, you know, cutting, cutting weight. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8796.2s)]
*  I try to tell myself like we know we're not going to actually die. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8798.2s)]
*  We're going to feel like that or whatever. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8801.2s)]
*  But I could cut to 45 would be a lot easier. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8803.2s)]
*  Obviously, 55 would be the easiest. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8805.2s)]
*  But I wish more guys would. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8807.2s)]
*  But then again, like Aljo, he weighs how much right now? [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8809.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8812.2s)]
*  160 to 170. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8813.2s)]
*  How about Davidson? [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8814.2s)]
*  Davidson figure eight oh. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8815.2s)]
*  I wonder if he goes at 35. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8816.2s)]
*  Oh, he's fighting. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8818.2s)]
*  He's fighting. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8819.2s)]
*  Twenty five again. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8820.2s)]
*  He's going to do it again. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8821.2s)]
*  He said he was mad at me for saying that I didn't think he's going to be at 25. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8822.2s)]
*  He's going to be at 25 again. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8825.2s)]
*  But he's sure he's talked about that. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8826.2s)]
*  He's stacked. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8828.2s)]
*  Is he? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8829.2s)]
*  I've never been around him. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8830.2s)]
*  He's thick. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8831.2s)]
*  But when you're a certain height, I feel like you like you have to. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8832.2s)]
*  But then again, look at Henry. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8835.2s)]
*  He's fucking five three and he's fucking doing it. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8836.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8838.2s)]
*  So I guess it depends on how thick you are. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8839.2s)]
*  But how tall is figure eight oh, Jamie? [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8842.2s)]
*  Five five. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8844.2s)]
*  Five five. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8846.2s)]
*  See, he could fight at 35, but I'm damn near six foot. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8847.2s)]
*  It's crazy the different body types. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8852.2s)]
*  I mean, one is better than the other. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8854.2s)]
*  But I do think my length, my body type, Izzy, Alex Pahetta, John Jones, the long, Charles Olivera is the best for fighting. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8856.2s)]
*  Maybe the best for jujitsu too, I think. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8868.2s)]
*  It's very good for jujitsu and it's very good for distance. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8870.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8873.2s)]
*  You have so much of an advantage of like if you're fighting a short guy and he's coming. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8874.2s)]
*  John had he had a little puzzles to solve before he could land shots. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8878.2s)]
*  Fuckers good, dude. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8882.2s)]
*  He's good. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8883.2s)]
*  I find people's chins pretty not I wouldn't say easily, but I eventually find their chins quite a bit. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8884.2s)]
*  Like that's my whole thing. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8890.2s)]
*  I set it up, set it up. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8891.2s)]
*  Boom. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8892.2s)]
*  I want to find that chin. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8893.2s)]
*  I want to find that shut off button. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8894.2s)]
*  And fuckers hard to hit. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8895.2s)]
*  He's very good at tucking his chin. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8897.2s)]
*  He's very good at switching stances. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8899.2s)]
*  He throws such a his little body kick that he throws when we were opposite stance was so fast. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8900.2s)]
*  But yeah, finding his chin was difficult. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8906.2s)]
*  And then that second round, I found it a couple of times. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8909.2s)]
*  Then that knee in the third was that knee in the third was beautiful. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8912.2s)]
*  Yeah, that knee in the third was beautiful. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8916.2s)]
*  Fucking I and you know, Tim going into the second round. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8918.2s)]
*  So I had after the first round, going to the second round, he said, just trust that left hand, trust that left hand. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8921.2s)]
*  Because I knew when he was southpaw, not southpaw. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8926.2s)]
*  It's similar orthodox orthodox that right hand, obviously, but it's just switched. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8928.2s)]
*  And so I just trusted in that left hand, double jab through it, landed it clean, heard him. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8933.2s)]
*  Then go into that third round. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8938.2s)]
*  He's faint that right and throw that knee up the middle. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8939.2s)]
*  So that's what that that's important. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8942.2s)]
*  Having good corners that can see shit like that. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8944.2s)]
*  That was, you know, those two things he told me really changed the fight. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8946.2s)]
*  Like we heard I didn't win the second round, but I heard I dropped him. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8950.2s)]
*  I heard him bad at that left hand. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8953.2s)]
*  I hit him with that right hand, dropped him to his knee. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8955.2s)]
*  Then he cracked me with that left hand and immediately took me down. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8957.2s)]
*  But that fucking trip he got me with, he got that little trip when we're both. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8961.2s)]
*  I tried it back. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8966.2s)]
*  I got up right away and I tried it right back to him. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8967.2s)]
*  And then at the end of the third, I tried it in it. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8970.2s)]
*  And then he took he didn't really take me down as more of a like a failed attempt. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8973.2s)]
*  So I wouldn't even consider that a takedown on his part because it was just a shitty failed attempt on my part. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8976.2s)]
*  But I was trying to get him back with that. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8981.2s)]
*  You wanted to get him back like twice. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8983.2s)]
*  Yeah, just because I was like, God damn it. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8985.2s)]
*  The fucker got me. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8987.2s)]
*  I want it. He's good at those Muay Thai trips. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8988.2s)]
*  Yeah, I was hitting him sparring every single sparring session. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8990.2s)]
*  I was hitting someone with that same trip where you step in. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8993.2s)]
*  He had Aljo with it too a couple of times or once. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8996.2s)]
*  But I wanted that bad in that it going into that fight. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=8998.2s)]
*  And he got me with it. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9001.2s)]
*  A little fucker. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9004.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very impressed with him. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9005.2s)]
*  And he's very defensively responsible. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9006.2s)]
*  He keeps his hands up high. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9008.2s)]
*  He's always rock solid with his defense. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9010.2s)]
*  Going into that right at the end of the first round, going into the second round, staring at him on the bench or on this little stool looking at him. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9012.2s)]
*  I was like, this motherfucker wasn't expecting this. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9019.2s)]
*  I felt him taking pretty big breaths going into the second round. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9022.2s)]
*  He usually is in really good shape. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9028.2s)]
*  But I don't think he was expecting me to be as good as I was or him to have to grapple. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9031.2s)]
*  He grappled a lot more in that first round than he usually does. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9037.2s)]
*  That's exhausting. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9040.2s)]
*  But I felt like an energy switch in him going to the second round. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9041.2s)]
*  But that fucking left hand he landed. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9047.2s)]
*  Did you watch that slow mo at all? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9049.2s)]
*  They've showed that we played that. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9050.2s)]
*  Because I've never really been hit with a shot like that. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9052.2s)]
*  I've been hitting sparring hard. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9055.2s)]
*  But that was the cleanest left hand I've ever been hit with. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9056.2s)]
*  And the only thing I can think of how I took that is I was in such good shape. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9059.2s)]
*  I just did everything fucking right for 12 weeks. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9064.2s)]
*  And I was able to take that because of that. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9067.2s)]
*  Because that fucking could have not land cleaner. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9070.2s)]
*  It was perfect. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9073.2s)]
*  It was a perfect left hand. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9074.2s)]
*  It was because I rewatched it back. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9075.2s)]
*  And for me, I get hit when I plant my feet. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9077.2s)]
*  When my feet are planted, that's when I can start getting hit. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9081.2s)]
*  When I'm moving on my feet, it's very hard for me to get hit. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9084.2s)]
*  But that's why we hit me. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9088.2s)]
*  I had my feet planted. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9089.2s)]
*  He threw it. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9091.2s)]
*  I kind of leaned back rather instead of using my feet to get me back. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9092.2s)]
*  But yeah, that fucker's super, super skilled. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9095.2s)]
*  I'm excited to watch whoever he fights next. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9098.2s)]
*  I don't think he's leaving the UFC. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9099.2s)]
*  He's one of the best guys in the world. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9101.2s)]
*  You've got to fight in the best way. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9103.2s)]
*  I hope he doesn't leave. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9104.2s)]
*  The problem with leaving is, yeah, you can get paid other places. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9105.2s)]
*  But you won't be in the UFC anymore. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9108.2s)]
*  You could get a good gig at Bellator. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9110.2s)]
*  You could get a good gig at the PFL. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9112.2s)]
*  Fuck that. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9116.2s)]
*  It's not the same. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9118.2s)]
*  No. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9119.2s)]
*  It's not the same, unfortunately. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9120.2s)]
*  I think it's better now than it's ever been before. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9122.2s)]
*  But there's still really good guys over at Bellator that nobody knows who they are. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9124.2s)]
*  The wildest thing is 1FC. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9128.2s)]
*  Because those fucking guys, there's guys over there that are fucking good. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9130.2s)]
*  They're fucking elite. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9133.2s)]
*  Really? [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9135.2s)]
*  Don't watch. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9136.2s)]
*  I think it's crazy you don't watch that. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9137.2s)]
*  How do you not watch? [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9139.2s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9140.2s)]
*  I don't really watch fights in general unless it's a massive fight. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9142.2s)]
*  Always tune into Conor Fight or Nate Fight, John Jones. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9146.2s)]
*  I'll tune into the biggest fights. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9150.2s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9154.2s)]
*  I try to. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9156.2s)]
*  Just fucking... [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9157.2s)]
*  You don't get into it. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9158.2s)]
*  Maybe it's just because you're doing it. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9159.2s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9160.2s)]
*  Maybe when you're done fighting you'll enjoy it more. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9161.2s)]
*  But maybe it's just like you just need a break. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9164.2s)]
*  It's obviously you're fully immersed. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9166.2s)]
*  You see plenty of fighting. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9168.2s)]
*  Just with your own. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9169.2s)]
*  And sparring and training and fights that you have to watch because you're there. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9171.2s)]
*  I'll re-watch my fight. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9175.2s)]
*  No, I do think that's one thing where I improved the most was watching my own sparring back consistently. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9176.2s)]
*  Like every sparring session I'll record it, watch it back. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9182.2s)]
*  And I've been doing that since pretty much I went to the lab like 8 years ago. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9185.2s)]
*  I have such crazy... [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9190.2s)]
*  I have like a library of stuff on my YouTube. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9191.2s)]
*  I just make it private and upload it to my YouTube so I can delete it off my phone. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9193.2s)]
*  But I have rounds with like sweet rounds like Alex Casarez and what's Henry's boy's name? [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9197.2s)]
*  Pantoja before I was even in the UFC and he was. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9204.2s)]
*  I have some sweet rounds from way back in the day. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9208.2s)]
*  But I do think that's where I improved a lot was recording it and watching it. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9212.2s)]
*  Yeah, just fucking figuring out what the fuck I'm doing wrong and right. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9216.2s)]
*  And also, what do you like about watching yourself? [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9221.2s)]
*  That you can see what it looks like versus how you feel. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9224.2s)]
*  And also like you see where maybe you would see openings on you. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9228.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, 100%. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9232.2s)]
*  I've re-watched my fights and thought what is their coach? [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9233.2s)]
*  What is my opponent looking? [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9237.2s)]
*  Where do they think that they can take advantage of what I'm doing? [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9238.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's for sure I've watched my fights back like that. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9241.2s)]
*  Do you ever look at it like you where you would take advantage of what you're doing? [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9244.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9247.2s)]
*  Like if you were fighting you? [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9248.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I tried to look at it from I will I try to watch it from yeah as many different perspectives as I can. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9250.2s)]
*  But but for the most part like the Pedro Munoz fight. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9256.2s)]
*  Fuck, that one just did not end like that one. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9260.2s)]
*  I don't really re-watch it was nothing really happened. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9263.2s)]
*  He tried to kick my legs for about five minutes. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9266.2s)]
*  I checked most of them and that's pretty much what that fight sucked. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9269.2s)]
*  I fucking hated that fight. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9273.2s)]
*  That's probably the one I've watched back the least amount. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9275.2s)]
*  The Peter one I've watched back a ton already like probably ten times. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9278.2s)]
*  The Munoz fight that ended on an eye poke. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9282.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, supposedly. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9285.2s)]
*  No, I'm sorry. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9287.2s)]
*  I mean it was weird. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9288.2s)]
*  I mean it's Pedro Munoz. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9289.2s)]
*  It's the killers of killers. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9290.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9292.2s)]
*  Like if I mean he must not have been able to see but if you watch it's like it wasn't like that bad of a poke compared to two fights later when Izzy put you know half his [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9293.2s)]
*  finger in Jared Kennedy's eye and Jared's like no fuck I'm good. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9302.2s)]
*  So I don't know if I don't know like I mean if he literally couldn't see I could see it. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9305.2s)]
*  But I think sometimes for whatever reason like less of it's just how the eye gets hit. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9309.2s)]
*  I've seen guys get really poked where it looks bad and they say they're fine. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9315.2s)]
*  And I've seen guys where they get grazed and they can't fucking see like they can't open their eye. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9319.2s)]
*  And then you find out later that they had cornea scratches and all this shit. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9324.2s)]
*  It's real. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9327.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9328.2s)]
*  How much of a difference do you think it makes with having like what percentage of like trying to get a hand under a neck with the glove? [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9329.2s)]
*  Rear naked. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9336.2s)]
*  30 percent harder. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9337.2s)]
*  Yeah probably something like that. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9338.2s)]
*  It's definitely you know the extra couple inches trying to get under the neck especially fighting it hard. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9339.2s)]
*  I was surprised the first time I wore gloves to try to grapple how. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9345.2s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9349.2s)]
*  Yeah you would think it's not that much bigger. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9350.2s)]
*  Well even guillotines or you know shooting a dars. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9352.2s)]
*  Nothing fits. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9354.2s)]
*  All the headlocked shows. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9355.2s)]
*  Nothing slides in anymore. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9356.2s)]
*  Yeah super fucking weird. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9357.2s)]
*  It sucks too when you're sparring like on a Saturday. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9358.2s)]
*  You got a good grappler wrestler going you have shin pads on. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9361.2s)]
*  There's fucking they take you down. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9364.2s)]
*  They're like just the whole shin pads. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9366.2s)]
*  I wonder if there's a way you could somehow make those. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9369.2s)]
*  But then again you got to protect your fucking I don't know. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9371.2s)]
*  Yeah but grappling with shin pads is fucking hard. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9375.2s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9378.2s)]
*  So hard. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9379.2s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9380.2s)]
*  It sucks. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9381.2s)]
*  They get in the way. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9382.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9383.2s)]
*  Yeah even sparring with them sucks. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9384.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9385.2s)]
*  You want to protect your shins but everything moves slower. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9386.2s)]
*  It seems sloppier. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9389.2s)]
*  Feel heavy. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9390.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9391.2s)]
*  If I'm going if I'm sparring a guy and it's like all right their main objectives take me fucking down. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9392.2s)]
*  It's going to be a grapple fuck. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9398.2s)]
*  It's like I've winning those Saturday sparring rounds without shin pads and didn't even kick. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9400.2s)]
*  Just boxed and grappled boxed and grappled because it's unrealistic sometimes. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9403.2s)]
*  Like if someone gets you down and you like you're trying to get your bottom leg free and it's like there's like four extra five extra inches or whatever it is. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9408.2s)]
*  You can't even get your leg free and then you're there for the rest of the round. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9415.2s)]
*  But these next this next fight camp is going to be grapple fuck either one Henry or Aljoe. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9419.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9426.2s)]
*  Their goal take me down for Peter. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9427.2s)]
*  I grappled we had guys grab I mean we grappled like normal and then but for sparring for the most part we didn't grapple much. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9429.2s)]
*  Like we had guys trying to shoot every once in a while and stuff. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9436.2s)]
*  But yeah I was planning on that being a legit just kickboxing fight. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9439.2s)]
*  That fucker came out shooting. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9442.2s)]
*  But I wonder I'd be curious if his game plan was to shoot or if I started cracking him early and he was like all right I'm going to start fucking wrestling. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9444.2s)]
*  That's how I'm going to win this fight. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9452.2s)]
*  Well there was quite a few moments where he was trying to engage with you and it was he was having a hard time getting past that length and you know you've been really accurate to the teeps those body kicks. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9453.2s)]
*  It's so weird because when I even you watch on TV you can kind of see like all his body keep those fucking teeps are deadly. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9462.2s)]
*  You saw Dan Hooker's teeps like against that last guy finished the fight and I throw I mean this I was doing serious damage to his body with those teeps. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9470.2s)]
*  It could have been why he was you know fatiguing faster than usual to that's like probably the most dangerous weapon I'd say for long guys. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9479.2s)]
*  Those fucking front kick. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9488.2s)]
*  Oh yeah man. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9489.2s)]
*  It's fucking amazing kick. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9490.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9491.2s)]
*  Especially when guys are kind of in MMA style they're kind of facing towards you a little bit. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9492.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9495.2s)]
*  I think potentially taking you down that wider target. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9496.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9498.2s)]
*  A good front kick to the body Tony Ferguson always had a good front kick to the body. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9499.2s)]
*  Good front kick to the body. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9502.2s)]
*  You risk that fucking feet injury though because you might kick an elbow you might kick a fucking yeah an elbow. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9504.2s)]
*  Get those polaton feet. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9510.2s)]
*  Yeah you got some yeah my fucking toes are. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9512.2s)]
*  You know who had the nastiest front kick to the body? [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9514.2s)]
*  Semmy Schilt. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9516.2s)]
*  Do you remember Semmy Schilt? [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9517.2s)]
*  I feel like that name's familiar but. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9518.2s)]
*  He was a he was a K1 champion. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9520.2s)]
*  Giant guy like seven feet tall fought in the UFC too. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9523.2s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9525.2s)]
*  Seven feet? [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9526.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9527.2s)]
*  Semmy Schilt was giant man. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9528.2s)]
*  Semmy Schilt was giant. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9529.2s)]
*  You gotta have a good front kick if you're seven fucking feet. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9530.2s)]
*  Elite kick boxer. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9532.2s)]
*  And Semmy used to fuck people up with that front kick. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9533.2s)]
*  Well then you start yeah you got front kick then they have to respect it going to the body then you fucking go high with it and you fucking head kick someone. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9536.2s)]
*  He had one of the most disturbing losses ever to Sergey Keratanov in Pride where Sergey Keratanov got on top of him and he pinned him down. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9543.2s)]
*  Semmy was just a kick boxer and Keratanov was like a Sambo guy. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9554.2s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9557.2s)]
*  Got on top of him and just kept punching him in his one eye. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9558.2s)]
*  Hammer hammer fisting him and punching him in his one eye and his eye was a fucking bloody mess. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9561.2s)]
*  And he was trapped and he was just getting punched and hammer fisted in this one eye. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9568.2s)]
*  Look he's hitting this one eye. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9573.2s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9575.2s)]
*  God dude just a kick boxer huh? [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9576.2s)]
*  So he's mounted on him and then he pins his arm down and then when he pins his arm he's just a kick boxer. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9578.2s)]
*  Pins his arm down here. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9583.2s)]
*  I mean Semmy's fucked dude. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9584.2s)]
*  I mean he's just so out of his world here and then when he gets on top of him he just starts hitting this one eye. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9586.2s)]
*  That left eye over and over and over again man. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9592.2s)]
*  He pins his arm down here and just starts hammer fisting it and he can't do shit man he's just trapped. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9594.2s)]
*  Fucking Molly Meatball and fucking that was crazy. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9600.2s)]

*  Oh yeah. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9604.2s)]

*  That's a crazy little trap he's got there. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9610.2s)]
*  Oh my god it's just grappling superiority. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9612.2s)]
*  Pure grappling superiority. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9615.2s)]
*  Look how he's doing this. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9616.2s)]
*  Life or death. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9617.2s)]
*  No no no you're going to stay here. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9618.2s)]
*  This guy can't do shit. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9619.2s)]
*  I mean he's just stuck. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9621.2s)]
*  And Keratanov was fucking terrifying back then. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9623.2s)]
*  He was really good standing up too. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9626.2s)]
*  In fact he wound up fighting in glory. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9628.2s)]
*  What a how many minute round was the first one in that? [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9630.2s)]
*  Ten minutes. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9633.2s)]
*  Ten minutes. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9634.2s)]
*  Pride's first round was ten minutes. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9635.2s)]
*  He's probably been there for about seven huh? [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9636.2s)]
*  Yeah well look at this. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9637.2s)]
*  It's like a minute fifteen to go. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9638.2s)]
*  What round does that say? [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9640.2s)]
*  I can't even read it. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9641.2s)]
*  Round one it looked like. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9642.2s)]
*  It's so blurry. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9643.2s)]
*  So he took him down there. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9644.2s)]
*  Yeah he's down for seven minutes. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9646.2s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9647.2s)]
*  Damn seven minutes on top. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9648.2s)]
*  So he took him down early. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9649.2s)]
*  So now he's just hammering his eyeball with his hammer fists. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9650.2s)]
*  If you're a kickboxer what do you like? [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9653.2s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9655.2s)]

*  Look at this. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9660.2s)]
*  Oh. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9661.2s)]
*  It's a big guy on top dude. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9662.2s)]
*  One of the most disturbing stoppages ever. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9663.2s)]
*  I mean when do you throw in the towel? [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9664.2s)]
*  Look at this man. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9665.2s)]
*  Like fuck. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9666.2s)]
*  Look at his eye. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9667.2s)]
*  Oh. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9668.2s)]
*  It's his right eye sorry. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9669.2s)]
*  His right eye is just a bloody mess. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9670.2s)]
*  Oh there you go. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9671.2s)]
*  And the referee is like enough. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9672.2s)]
*  I mean it looks like he's going to fucking lose his eye if he keeps going. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9673.2s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9677.2s)]
*  Terrifying. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9678.2s)]
*  It was one of the most disturbing stoppages because it's a guy that's totally helpless. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9679.2s)]
*  The guy who's on the bottom like he's totally out of his water. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9683.2s)]
*  No nothing. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9686.2s)]
*  His jujitsu is just not and Keretanov is an assassin. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9687.2s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9691.2s)]
*  He was like a Russian special forces guy too or something. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9692.2s)]
*  The Russians are terrifying. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9696.2s)]
*  What was his background? [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9697.2s)]
*  He's a terrifying one. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9698.2s)]
*  He's still fighting man. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9699.2s)]
*  No. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9700.2s)]
*  Keretanov is still fighting. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9701.2s)]
*  Geez. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9702.2s)]

*  But Keretanov is still around man. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9707.2s)]
*  He's 42. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9709.2s)]
*  He's 42 still banging out. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9710.2s)]
*  So he was young then. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9711.2s)]
*  He was young then. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9714.2s)]

*  Oh fuck. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9847.2s)]
*  I don't think Tyrone Spong has fought kickboxing since. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9848.2s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9857.2s)]
*  Dude. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9858.2s)]
*  I think that was his last kickboxing fight and then he did some boxing fights and he [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9859.2s)]
*  was getting a pretty good name in boxing but he had a big fight fall through and then he [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9865.2s)]
*  fought Garret Onof and then my man. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9869.2s)]
*  Through those breaks. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9871.2s)]
*  Oh I wonder if. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9872.2s)]
*  I'm so curious who Connor's going to fight. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9873.2s)]
*  I wonder if he looks at Michael Chandler because at one point I mean Chandler throws bombs [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9877.2s)]
*  but he throws hooks. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9882.2s)]
*  He throws some fire. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9884.2s)]
*  How does the USADA thing work? [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9885.2s)]
*  I guess he's not even in the pool anymore. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9887.2s)]
*  If he's not in the pool so how much time does he need before he gets back and competes once [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9890.2s)]
*  he gets back in the pool? [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9894.2s)]
*  I think six months is what they say. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9895.2s)]
*  Six months. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9896.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9897.2s)]
*  That's a long time. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9898.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9899.2s)]
*  So do you think his leg's still fucked up? [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9900.2s)]
*  What do you think is going on? [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9903.2s)]
*  I don't even have thought. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9905.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9907.2s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9908.2s)]
*  I mean I don't know why he was out of the pool. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9909.2s)]
*  I don't know if they took him out because he's on a fucking yacht everywhere and he's [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9910.2s)]
*  just untestable. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9914.2s)]
*  Like how are you going to fucking test him if he doesn't really. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9915.2s)]
*  That doesn't seem fair. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9918.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9919.2s)]
*  I mean I literally don't think he's getting. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9920.2s)]
*  I don't think he got tested last year or whatever it was. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9922.2s)]
*  No I don't think he got tested. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9925.2s)]
*  This year. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9926.2s)]
*  If he jumps back into the pool in December. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9927.2s)]
*  January, February, March, April, May, June. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9929.2s)]
*  He can fight in June and July. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9932.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9934.2s)]
*  If he gets back in December which is soon. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9935.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9937.2s)]
*  And if he does who does he fight? [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9938.2s)]
*  But that's something that people need to realize when they toss names around. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9940.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9943.2s)]
*  Like if you toss in Connor, I want Connor, I want Connor. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9944.2s)]
*  You're talking about six months from now minimum. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9946.2s)]
*  Which might work out for Chandler after going through that war. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9950.2s)]
*  Connor has to see a guy that's going to get him excited that he sees as very winnable. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9953.2s)]
*  And Chandler's dangerous but he's shorter and he throws fucking hooks. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9957.2s)]
*  Connor's a bigger and he throws and he's a sniper. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9963.2s)]
*  He throws him down the middle. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9965.2s)]
*  So he might look at that. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9967.2s)]
*  Chandler can take it though. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9968.2s)]
*  He can fucking take it. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9969.2s)]
*  For sure. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9970.2s)]
*  Bounce back. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9971.2s)]
*  Dangerous motherfucker. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9972.2s)]
*  That guy has warrior spirit. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9973.2s)]
*  Crazy warrior spirit. [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9975.2s)]
*  Like maybe too crazy. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9976.2s)]
*  Like maybe if he fought. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9977.2s)]
*  Smart. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9979.2s)]
*  Try to be a little more elusive. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9980.2s)]
*  But it's like that's how he gets the fans too. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9982.2s)]
*  He's do or die. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9985.2s)]
*  And he does it every fucking time he fights man. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9986.2s)]
*  You can guarantee if Michael Chandler's fighting some fucking chaos is going to happen. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9988.2s)]
*  His run in the UFC since he's gotten signed has probably been the craziest. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9993.2s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9997.2s)]
*  The fucking craziest. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9998.2s)]
*  In terms of entertainment, holy shit. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=9999.2s)]
*  Every fight he's in is do or die. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10001.2s)]
*  All of them are exciting. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10003.2s)]
*  So if Connor comes back it's going to be at 170. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10004.2s)]
*  He's got to be. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10007.2s)]
*  He's a fucking massive. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10008.2s)]
*  But he's also still shooting a movie isn't he? [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10009.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10011.2s)]
*  Like that's got to take. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10012.2s)]
*  You cannot shoot a movie and fucking train for a fight. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10013.2s)]
*  You just can't do it. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10017.2s)]
*  You can't do anything and train for a fight. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10018.2s)]
*  No you can't. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10020.2s)]
*  But I don't think he's actually trying to train for a fight now. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10021.2s)]
*  But they're just talking about him potentially fighting. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10023.2s)]
*  But everybody needs to recognize if that's the case. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10026.2s)]
*  Then you're talking about six months from now. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10029.2s)]
*  And maybe if I mean who does he fight? [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10031.2s)]
*  So Volkanovsky and Islam fight. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10036.2s)]
*  And Islam beats Volkanovsky. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10039.2s)]
*  What's next? [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10041.2s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10042.2s)]
*  Is it a rematch with Olvera? [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10044.2s)]
*  What is it? [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10045.2s)]
*  That would be exciting. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10046.2s)]
*  Islam versus, I mean Poirier? [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10047.2s)]
*  I don't know if people. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10049.2s)]
*  He's not 265. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10050.2s)]
*  He's joking around. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10051.2s)]
*  He's joking around. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10052.2s)]
*  Is it Poirier versus Islam? [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10053.2s)]
*  Someone's got to come and make some fucking noise. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10056.2s)]
*  I mean Poirier and Chandler was a great fight. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10058.2s)]
*  It was a lot of fun. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10060.2s)]
*  It was awesome. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10061.2s)]
*  But I don't know what he wants to do next. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10062.2s)]
*  Dustin might just want to take big money fights. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10067.2s)]
*  Like whoever talks the most shit and can sell the most tickets. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10070.2s)]
*  I mean Dustin is crazy. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10073.2s)]
*  He's not headlining after those Conor wins. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10075.2s)]
*  I don't feel like he took advantage of that opportunity. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10077.2s)]
*  And he should be headlining, making pay-per-view money. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10082.2s)]
*  But he's just not. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10084.2s)]
*  Is that his fault though? [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10085.2s)]
*  I mean he got the interim title when he fought Max Holloway. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10086.2s)]
*  And then when he lost to Khabib and he lost to Olivera and he beat Conor. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10091.2s)]
*  I mean he's in a great spot. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10097.2s)]
*  He's in that fucking top soup. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10099.2s)]
*  But if you're the person that's making, if you're Mick Maynard and you're making the decision, [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10102.2s)]
*  you're Sean Shelby and you're saying, okay, this is the next fight. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10108.2s)]
*  Who do you pick? [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10112.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10113.2s)]
*  Do you pick Poirier? [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10114.2s)]
*  Do you pick Poirier? [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10116.2s)]
*  Like Poirier, it's like a great fighter, might win, might beat everybody. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10117.2s)]
*  But like who's the nut, like there's no like real clear compelling contender, right? [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10122.2s)]
*  Justin fought Charles. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10127.2s)]
*  Justin fought, that's right, Justin fought Charles and got stopped. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10130.2s)]
*  Justin fought Dustin Poirier. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10133.2s)]
*  How many times did they fight? [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10136.2s)]
*  Justin, Dustin only fought the once. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10137.2s)]
*  Just engaging in Dustin Poirier? [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10140.2s)]
*  So I know what you're saying. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10143.2s)]
*  Okay, so Charles beat Justin and then Islam beat Charles. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10144.2s)]
*  So Islam would, I mean the MMA math, it's hard to say, but yeah. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10147.2s)]
*  Well, if you wanted to have a gachey Charles rematch, it's like, you know, Charles took him out pretty quick. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10151.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it wasn't, like I said, I haven't seen all of it. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10160.2s)]
*  I've seen a couple highlights, but it didn't seem like Charles really ever had Islam in danger, did he? [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10163.2s)]
*  Well, Charles was like competent, you know, he was like defensively responsible. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10167.2s)]
*  He threatened a little bit off of his back, but Islam was so good in that fight. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10174.2s)]
*  It's like who is compelling other than Volkanovsky, like who's compelling? [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10178.2s)]
*  I mean there's no one on that I look at, I'm like, ooh, that'd be fucking interesting. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10183.2s)]
*  I mean other than Volkanovsky, who's at 45, who's still even questionable if it is. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10187.2s)]
*  I mean does Islam go up, is there, who's set 70? [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10192.2s)]
*  Oh fuck, Islam could be Leon. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10195.2s)]
*  Dude, this is how crazy good, that would be an amazing fight. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10197.2s)]
*  Yeah, this is Gachey versus Oliveira. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10201.2s)]
*  Ooh, Charles. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10204.2s)]
*  This is how good Islam is, right? [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10206.2s)]
*  Because up until this moment, when Charles Oliveira finished Justin Gachey and he just beat him up and dropped him on the feet and then submitted him on the ground, [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10209.2s)]
*  people were thinking there's no one that can challenge Charles. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10218.2s)]
*  Charles is at such an elite level. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10222.2s)]
*  Islam beats him so soundly that now you're like, I don't even know if it makes sense for Charles to fight him again. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10224.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's insane. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10231.2s)]
*  That's how good he is. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10233.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean does he move up, I mean Islam in Kamaru, that's interesting if Kamaru beats Leon. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10234.2s)]
*  But you're assuming that Islam wants to go up. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10242.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10245.2s)]
*  Like he might decide that he could just crush everybody at 155 and just run the division for a while. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10246.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10251.2s)]
*  If he just won the title, why would he go up to 70, right? [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10252.2s)]
*  No, that's, yeah. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10256.2s)]
*  I mean, it would be crazy though if he beats Volkanovsky, who's the 45 pound champ, he's not double champ, but beats the 45 pound champ, [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10258.2s)]
*  beat the 55 pound champ and then goes up and beats the 70 pound champ, that's fucking insane. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10266.2s)]
*  Dude, look how fucking well he dominates on the ground here. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10271.2s)]
*  Yeah, his next level is jittery. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10275.2s)]
*  He gets his back, he cranks out a triangle while he's sitting there. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10277.2s)]
*  Yeah, most fighters don't have great actual, like high level Brazilian jiu-jitsu. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10281.2s)]
*  Dude, look at that transition to the rear naked, I mean that's just sensational. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10288.2s)]
*  And body triangle. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10291.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10293.2s)]
*  It's just sensational. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10294.2s)]
*  So Charles was so good, Charles was so good when he was running shit that we couldn't imagine a fight where you maybe didn't think it was compelling for him to fight for the title again. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10295.2s)]
*  That's how good Islam is. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10307.2s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10308.2s)]
*  Was Charles the underdog too going into that? [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10309.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10312.2s)]
*  Damn. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10313.2s)]
*  Yeah, he was the underdog. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10314.2s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10315.2s)]
*  Which is nuts. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10316.2s)]
*  Yeah, who the fuck? [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10317.2s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10318.2s)]
*  Yeah, that is actually insane. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10319.2s)]
*  As dominant as he was as a champion, to have him be the underdog, make sure that's true, because I'm pretty sure that's true. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10320.2s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10325.2s)]
*  That Charles Oliver was the underdog in the Islam Makachev fight? [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10326.2s)]
*  Yeah, who knows? [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10332.2s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he was. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10333.2s)]
*  In two years some fucking stud can just come out of nowhere and be like the next guy. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10334.2s)]
*  The next guy. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10338.2s)]
*  The next guy could be in fucking... [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10339.2s)]
*  Oliver was the underdog. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10341.2s)]
*  Oliver was the underdog. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10342.2s)]
*  It was not a lot, but yeah, he was the underdog. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10343.2s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10345.2s)]
*  Yeah, crazy. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10346.2s)]
*  Champion, dominant champion, submitting everybody, underdog. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10347.2s)]
*  That's how good Islam is. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10350.2s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10352.2s)]
*  I wonder if Michael Chandler would have beat Poirier if we would have been more excited for Chandler versus Islam rather than Poirier versus Islam. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10353.2s)]
*  Yeah, 190. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10362.2s)]
*  It's a two to one favorite. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10363.2s)]
*  Almost two to one. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10364.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10365.2s)]
*  65.5% win probability to become the new lightweight champion. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10366.2s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10371.2s)]
*  That's how good that guy is. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10372.2s)]
*  That is bananas. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10373.2s)]
*  I feel like Charles fought a bunch, like back to back to back to back. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10374.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, he did. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10377.2s)]
*  That's what he'd do though. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10378.2s)]
*  I mean look what is he doing? [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10379.2s)]
*  He's fucking doing it. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10380.2s)]
*  Well when he fought Tony Ferguson, that was like a big coming out party for him in a lot of ways. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10381.2s)]
*  You know, he fought Tony Ferguson and people were like, oh shit. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10386.2s)]
*  Like look how he dominated Tony. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10390.2s)]
*  And when Tony didn't tap from that arm bar... [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10392.2s)]
*  That gives me fucking... [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10395.2s)]
*  Yeah, that shit's gross. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10396.2s)]
*  The craziest... [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10398.2s)]
*  I remember I've watched like Benson highlights of him being in submissions and not getting submitted. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10399.2s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10405.2s)]
*  It's just some guys... [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10407.2s)]
*  I think Benson was like the first high level guy I watched at the gym when I went to the lab. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10408.2s)]
*  I was like, oh shit. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10414.2s)]
*  He was the first guy to implement calf kicks. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10415.2s)]
*  Yeah, his fucking legs dude. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10417.2s)]
*  Giant. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10420.2s)]
*  I mean I'm pretty sure he's recently won in...or he did just recently win in Ireland. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10421.2s)]
*  But yeah, I remember watching him. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10426.2s)]
*  His cardio is just something. [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10428.2s)]
*  He'll fucking go on a trip, come back, spar five rounds, five fives and just be like... [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10430.2s)]
*  Wow. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10434.2s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10435.2s)]
*  But that's where I first kind of learned like championship mindset. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10436.2s)]
*  I was like, okay this motherfucker's mind is just always...he's just championship mindset. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10440.2s)]
*  It was cool to see. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10447.2s)]
*  How old is he now? [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10448.2s)]
*  39. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10452.2s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10453.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10454.2s)]
*  And so who is he fighting for right now? [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10455.2s)]
*  Is he Bellator still? [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10456.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's still... [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10457.2s)]
*  So he just fought in Ireland? [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10458.2s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10459.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10460.2s)]
*  Look at that, Peter Queely. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10461.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10462.2s)]
*  That's a good win. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10463.2s)]
*  Oh yes, hell. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10464.2s)]
*  He beat Islam. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10465.2s)]
*  Different Islam but... [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10466.2s)]
*  I don't know that gentleman who he beat. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10467.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10471.2s)]
*  Do you know who that is? [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10472.2s)]
*  The Peter Queely or Islam moment? [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10473.2s)]
*  Oh no, Peter Queely. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10474.2s)]
*  Oh okay. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10475.2s)]
*  I'm not sure about the Islam guy. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10476.2s)]
*  There's so many guys, like if you want to follow Bellator, like there's hundreds of [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10477.2s)]
*  guys over there. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10482.320000000002s)]
*  They're really good. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10483.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10484.320000000002s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10485.320000000002s)]
*  There's so many...if the overall landscape of MMA fighters...someone told me that the [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10486.320000000002s)]
*  UFC has a thousand fighters now. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10489.52s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10490.960000000001s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10491.960000000001s)]
*  That's a...I don't know. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10492.960000000001s)]
*  How many fighters does the UFC have signed? [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10493.960000000001s)]
*  Somebody told me it was a thousand. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10496.880000000001s)]
*  It was like backstage. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10497.880000000001s)]
*  I was like, what? [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10498.880000000001s)]
*  Is that real? [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10499.880000000001s)]
*  That seems like a lot. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10500.880000000001s)]
*  Somebody else was saying it was 600. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10501.880000000001s)]
*  That seems more accurate. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10502.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but that's 2021. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10504.56s)]
*  Well dude, they signed everybody on fucking Tuesday night Contender Series. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10507.56s)]
*  You get a win, get in there. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10512.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, Contender Series was huge. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10513.92s)]
*  It was massive. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10517.24s)]
*  That's fucking brilliant. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10518.439999999999s)]
*  When you were having your fight called by Snoop Dogg, how crazy was that? [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10519.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that was... [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10524.839999999998s)]
*  How crazy was that? [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10525.839999999998s)]
*  It's so crazy looking at my career, how things have played out so perfect. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10527.8s)]
*  The fact Snoop Dogg was there, that was the first time that I started getting busy on [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10532.720000000001s)]
*  social media and starting to understand, okay, this is going to be a part of my career in [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10538.28s)]
*  my life moving forward. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10545.320000000002s)]
*  He would repost me or post me and then I started getting a bunch of followers from Snoop posting [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10547.640000000001s)]
*  me. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10552.04s)]
*  Yeah, that was fucking insane. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10553.04s)]
*  He's still to this day, you have a conversation with him, he'll call me sugar Shane. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10555.28s)]
*  Sugar Shane. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10559.160000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he'll still just call me sugar Shane. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10560.68s)]
*  Can I just keep it? [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10562.88s)]
*  I'm just like, that's just sugar Shane for the most part. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10564.76s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10567.039999999999s)]
*  But yeah, that was massive for my career, just literally having Snoop Dogg. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10568.039999999999s)]
*  And it was only that season they had Snoop in your eye doing the Snoop cast. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10573.2s)]
*  Well, it all came out of, I think Snoop live streaming, him watching the fights. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10576.88s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10582.44s)]
*  I think that's where it came from. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10583.44s)]
*  Snoop cast. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10585.6s)]
*  I think it came from just him talking into his phone and uploading it to social media. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10586.6s)]
*  And then I think there was one famous knockout that he... [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10592.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, Mally! [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10596.56s)]
*  Oh, Mally! [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10597.56s)]
*  Oh, Mally! [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10598.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah! [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10599.56s)]
*  Oh, Mally! [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10600.56s)]
*  Damn, that's crazy. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10601.56s)]
*  I still remember vividly doing interviews. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10603.0s)]
*  It was the first time doing big interviews at the UFCPI, being around UFC staff, being [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10605.24s)]
*  just around that, just saying, I'm going to be bigger than Conor. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10611.56s)]
*  I got so much shit for saying that. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10615.160000000002s)]
*  Now we're like, I'm on the verge. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10616.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10618.960000000001s)]
*  It's like, I'm getting there. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10619.960000000001s)]
*  Holy pre-face task, pre-colored hair. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10620.960000000001s)]
*  Look at you. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10624.960000000001s)]
*  You're a little kid. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10625.960000000001s)]
*  Your skin is fucked. [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10626.960000000001s)]
*  What does that feel like watching this? [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10627.960000000001s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10633.2s)]
*  That was what, 2017? [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10634.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10637.2s)]
*  It's almost embarrassing. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10640.0s)]
*  It's like fucking just such a young me. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10641.0s)]
*  It's such a fascinating thing that they can capture that moment in time and you can watch [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10644.44s)]
*  it and it puts your head back to who you were then when it happened. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10648.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10651.44s)]
*  I think specifically in that fight, I was eating a vegan diet. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10652.44s)]
*  I think like 140 pounds when I walked into the cage, weighted at 136. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10656.08s)]
*  I was just... [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10660.84s)]
*  So many things. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10661.92s)]
*  I remember having a really bad fight camp for that. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10663.640000000001s)]
*  I had a concussion in that fight camp. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10666.0s)]
*  I got a knee in the head. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10668.480000000001s)]
*  Wasn't really sparring. [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10669.480000000001s)]
*  Had the worst training camp of all time, but still that young me was just so confident. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10670.68s)]
*  I'd just come off a viral knockout over David Nuzzo. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10676.039999999999s)]
*  Have you seen that one? [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10679.359999999999s)]
*  You've probably seen it where I head kicked him this way and then spinning kicked him [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10680.359999999999s)]
*  the other way. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10684.199999999999s)]
*  Will you try to find that one? [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10685.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, find that. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10686.199999999999s)]
*  I was just coming off that. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10687.199999999999s)]
*  I had this confidence about me. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10688.199999999999s)]
*  I had knocked a bunch of people out previous in my amateur career and I think I was like [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10689.76s)]
*  five and oh, you're pro. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10692.64s)]
*  For some reason, in the backstage, I remember just being super confident. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10694.64s)]
*  This was the fight right before it. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10700.28s)]
*  Boom. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10701.68s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10702.68s)]
*  That was one of my favorite knockouts of all time. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10703.68s)]
*  That was just the sickest... [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10705.640000000001s)]
*  That was in Phoenix. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10706.640000000001s)]
*  That was the first time I fought on a bigger card. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10707.640000000001s)]
*  It was LFA. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10709.68s)]
*  You know what really impressed me about you when I found this out is that you didn't have [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10711.400000000001s)]
*  a background in traditional martial arts. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10714.52s)]
*  Just an athlete. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10716.68s)]
*  I just played ball sports and I just was intuitive. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10717.68s)]
*  I just fought. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10721.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10722.92s)]
*  I think the ball sports, it forces all this movement left and right really quickly. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10723.92s)]
*  You know, if you think about playing basketball, you're bam. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10729.119999999999s)]
*  Beautiful. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10732.32s)]
*  Oh, that was so, so sick. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10733.32s)]
*  If you think about playing basketball, you're constantly jumping one side to the other. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10734.8s)]
*  It involves all this explosive footwork and movement. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10738.64s)]
*  When they talk to Lomachenko and he tells everybody his dad made him do Russian dance, [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10741.88s)]
*  traditional Russian dance for two years, watch him move, man. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10746.679999999998s)]
*  Look at the way he moves. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10750.24s)]
*  It's incredible. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10751.24s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10752.24s)]
*  His footwork is fucking sensational. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10753.24s)]
*  That's an advantage that you have too. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10755.599999999999s)]
*  The kicking is really good. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10758.0s)]
*  It seems like you were a black belt in karate or something. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10761.480000000001s)]
*  When you watch you throw those kicks, if I didn't know, because you told me, I'd be like, [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10764.480000000001s)]
*  oh yeah, he definitely was a karate champion or something. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10768.68s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10771.08s)]
*  It looks like you really know how to execute them and it's over a relatively short amount [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10772.240000000002s)]
*  of time of training them. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10777.560000000001s)]
*  At that time, how long had you been even kicking? [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10779.08s)]
*  Well, I'd say I started kickboxing and stuff when I was 16. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10781.84s)]
*  I was probably 21 or 22 in that. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10785.6s)]
*  But I was never taught how to kick from anybody. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10789.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10792.880000000001s)]
*  It was just natural. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10793.880000000001s)]
*  Some people say they're born for certain things. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10796.720000000001s)]
*  I guess I was just born to fight because I do throw pretty good techniques without having [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10798.28s)]
*  learned it. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10802.92s)]
*  That's amazing. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10803.92s)]
*  Did you watch a lot of fighting? [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10804.92s)]
*  No, I never watched fighting. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10806.480000000001s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10807.84s)]
*  I never. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10808.84s)]
*  I literally, when I first, I remember Tim would make fun of me when I first moved to Arizona. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10809.84s)]
*  We were living together because I was 19. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10814.2s)]
*  He's like, dude, you can't name, I couldn't name any of the UFC champs. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10816.04s)]
*  I was like, John Jones. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10819.28s)]
*  It was the only one I know. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10820.28s)]
*  And then his girlfriend literally named from 25 all the way up, knew every one of them. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10821.28s)]
*  And I didn't know any of the, who was the champ in any of the divisions. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10825.08s)]
*  And I was moving to, I was living in Phoenix to become, to get in the UFC. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10828.560000000001s)]
*  I just didn't, I don't know. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10832.0s)]
*  I just didn't watch it. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10833.0s)]
*  I just loved, I think it was competition, but I also fucking hated it because when I first [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10834.0s)]
*  the lab, never wrestled a day in my life. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10840.24s)]
*  And the labs like pretty known, like they're, they're more of a wrestling, I'd say, grinder [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10842.6s)]
*  gym. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10846.28s)]
*  Dude, I got fucked up for years and years and years go in, be like, all right, let's [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10847.28s)]
*  do two and two is wrestling. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10853.119999999999s)]
*  I didn't know how to fucking do a single leg or a double leg or any, any kind of wrestling. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10854.44s)]
*  I had no idea. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10858.199999999999s)]
*  I would just get fucked up by the guys that were already in the UFC. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10859.199999999999s)]
*  It's crazy looking back. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10863.28s)]
*  I would leave practices crying, be like, this is my only fucking thing. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10864.28s)]
*  Like I want to be in the UFC, but I don't, I just, I just had to tough it out for years [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10868.08s)]
*  at the lab. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10874.32s)]
*  Marlon Vera has a real similar story. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10875.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10877.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10878.0s)]
*  He went to Jackson's, just couldn't wrestle at all. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10879.0s)]
*  That's funny. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10881.0s)]
*  It was, you know, just amateur and just getting mauled by all these pros and just going, what [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10882.0s)]
*  the fuck am I doing with my life? [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10885.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10887.24s)]
*  I see people think I hate you. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10888.24s)]
*  I think he's a good dude. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10889.24s)]
*  And it's funny because when I do listen to him talk, like he was on here, right? [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10890.24s)]
*  I love that dude. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10893.0s)]
*  He eats saunas, he eats healthy. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10894.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10895.28s)]
*  You know, he's a father, he's got daughters, he's got kids. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10896.28s)]
*  He's like, I mean, we're similar. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10897.84s)]
*  People fucking think I hate him because I beat him up one time. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10899.48s)]
*  It's not the case. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10902.0s)]
*  I think we're good. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10903.36s)]
*  We're buddies at the end of the day. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10904.36s)]
*  But he, he just, yeah, I don't know. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10905.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, he, I've heard him talk about me sometimes and of course he's going to talk about you. [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10908.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10912.48s)]
*  But in very, he just, just like you're talking about him right now. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10913.48s)]
*  I'd say, what I say, I like him. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10915.36s)]
*  He says he hates me. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10916.72s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't say hates me, but it's very competitive. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10917.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10920.0s)]
*  No, I bet if you guys weren't in the same division, you'd be friends. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10921.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10923.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10924.24s)]
*  You never know. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10925.24s)]
*  You never know. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10926.24s)]
*  Hang out sometimes. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10927.64s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10928.64s)]
*  But that fight, that, that's an, that, that fight excites me. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10929.64s)]
*  This Peter Yon fight excited me so fucking much and I reached a level of excitement. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10931.8s)]
*  I didn't know I had like, I fight Eddie Wineland. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10936.8s)]
*  In my mind, I was superior as far as like, I'm better. [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10940.56s)]
*  I'm going to knock this dude out. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10943.28s)]
*  It wasn't like, and then the Thomas Almeida fight was right after the Cheeto fight and [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10944.28s)]
*  the same thing. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10948.72s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to beat this dude. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10949.72s)]
*  I'm going to beat this dude. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10950.72s)]
*  The Pedro Munoz fight I was pretty excited about, my top 10 guy, but I looked at that [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10951.72s)]
*  fight. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10955.16s)]
*  You know, go in there and do what I do and did how it ended. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10956.8s)]
*  But the Peter Yon fight, I was so excited. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10959.32s)]
*  Like this is the best motherfucker in the world. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10961.2s)]
*  This is what I had been training for, you know, 10 plus years for is to get this opportunity [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10964.56s)]
*  to go out there and compete with a guy this fucking good. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10969.52s)]
*  So in that camp was, there was a level of excitement going into sparring level of excitement [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10973.42s)]
*  doing my like, I'm like, just, it was different, but I feel like every fight moving forward [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10978.24s)]
*  it's going to be like that. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10984.04s)]
*  But that Cheeto one's going to be even just different just because of the backstory. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10985.04s)]
*  Well, I think you and Tim and your camp were very smart in how you moved up. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10988.720000000001s)]
*  You know, you came into the sport and came into the UFC young and talented and you did [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=10995.240000000002s)]
*  it very wisely. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11003.080000000002s)]
*  And now that you got into a position where you could fight the best, like Peter Yon, [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11004.800000000001s)]
*  about it really says to me that like management and a good coach that you trust that knows [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11009.32s)]
*  your abilities is really important. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11015.68s)]
*  It's really important in boxing, right? [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11017.48s)]
*  Like in boxing, they don't throw you to the wolves right away if they think you're good. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11019.68s)]
*  They build you up. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11023.72s)]
*  They give you a guy who's going to show you this look. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11024.76s)]
*  They give you, that's why in boxing it's so common for a guy to get 10 and 0, 11 and 0 [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11026.48s)]
*  before he gets tested. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11030.24s)]
*  I think there's something to that, man. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11032.039999999999s)]
*  You know, I think we have this fucking do or die fucking survival of the fittest. [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11033.88s)]
*  But you're professional athletes and I think to maximize the potential of a professional [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11038.16s)]
*  athlete, I think you have to match them up carefully because if you get in there with [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11042.48s)]
*  Alex Paheda, you know, and you're a guy who likes to bang it out, but maybe you really [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11049.72s)]
*  don't have good wrestling and oh Jesus Christ. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11055.76s)]
*  And you see that guy on the other end and you know they're building him up. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11058.24s)]
*  And so you have this thing in your head like you're being fed to the wolf. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11061.68s)]
*  You don't want that. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11065.76s)]
*  That's not good. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11067.12s)]
*  If you have potential, like maybe if that didn't happen and maybe you fought someone [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11068.12s)]
*  who was like commensurate with you and beat them and maybe learned a little bit more about [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11071.36s)]
*  footwork and maybe got a little bit better at takedowns, maybe got a little bit better [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11075.08s)]
*  at fighting off the cage and then two years later, three years later, then you can get [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11078.240000000002s)]
*  in there with an elite guy and you'll have confidence you can compete with them. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11081.720000000001s)]
*  But you see sometimes when guys like know they're being fed to the wolves, it's not [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11084.36s)]
*  a good look. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11088.84s)]
*  It's a fucking terrible feeling. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11089.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11091.720000000001s)]
*  I mean UFC is a fucking, it's a business. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11092.8s)]
*  At the end of the day they did what they did with me. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11094.76s)]
*  They saw me as a potential superstar and you know now we're here. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11098.439999999999s)]
*  They did it very wisely. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11101.24s)]
*  And your sky's the limit too man because the fucking division is filled with assassins. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11103.279999999999s)]
*  Sandhagen, he's a fucking assassin. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11108.359999999999s)]
*  That song you know, Dong Fight, holy shit. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11110.76s)]
*  We were there for the apex for that. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11112.92s)]
*  That's why I love the apex. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11115.0s)]
*  You could be right there. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11116.359999999999s)]
*  There's like a hundred people in the whole room. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11117.599999999999s)]
*  I hate that cage. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11119.76s)]
*  I fucking hate the small cage. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11120.76s)]
*  I like the big cage, especially for my style. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11122.36s)]
*  I'm sure wrestlers, short guys that like to get inside and push people against the cage, [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11124.4s)]
*  they probably loved the apex. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11128.16s)]
*  Don't you think they should just make it bigger? [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11129.16s)]
*  The apex cage? [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11131.119999999999s)]
*  Make it all the same. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11132.119999999999s)]
*  I don't know why that's not. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11133.119999999999s)]
*  How much bigger is it? [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11134.119999999999s)]
*  Like 40% bigger, like quite a bit bigger. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11135.24s)]
*  So is there room in the apex in it? [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11137.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11139.119999999999s)]
*  So why don't they make that bigger cage? [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11140.119999999999s)]
*  No idea. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11141.119999999999s)]
*  Wouldn't it be better? [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11142.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, way better. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11143.119999999999s)]
*  Because when I saw Francis fight Stipe in that little cage. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11144.119999999999s)]
*  Dude, Derrick Lewis is fighting this weekend in the apex. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11146.119999999999s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11149.44s)]
*  That's right. [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11150.44s)]
*  That's a B-Voc guy. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11151.560000000001s)]
*  That guy's a beast too. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11152.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't seen him compete. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11153.560000000001s)]
*  I don't think I might have. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11154.560000000001s)]
*  I just don't know his name. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11155.560000000001s)]
*  But Francis versus Stipe there was terrifying. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11156.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11159.560000000001s)]
*  That was patient Francis too. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11160.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so look at that. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11162.04s)]
*  7.62 meter diameter versus 9.14. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11164.04s)]
*  Wow, 44%. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11167.04s)]
*  So 44% larger. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11168.04s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11169.04s)]
*  It's a whole different sport. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11170.04s)]
*  Don't they have the room to put that big one in there? [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11171.04s)]
*  Dana, let's put the big one in there. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11176.04s)]
*  I used to be a fan of the little one, but now I'm really a fan of a fucking basketball [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11177.6s)]
*  court. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11182.4s)]
*  That's what I want. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11183.4s)]
*  I've heard you talk about that. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11184.4s)]
*  I want a flat surface with very clear out of bounds so there's no bullshit with plenty [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11185.4s)]
*  of room. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11190.960000000001s)]
*  If we could do it for basketball and you could do it for football, tell me why you can't [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11191.960000000001s)]
*  do it for MMA. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11194.880000000001s)]
*  Because the cage is a fucking weapon. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11195.880000000001s)]
*  It's a thing. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11198.36s)]
*  You can shove someone against it and hold them. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11199.36s)]
*  You could use it to get back up. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11201.640000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of things that happen with the cage. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11203.32s)]
*  It limits movement. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11204.8s)]
*  If you're going for a submission and you want to turn towards the cage and you can't, you're [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11205.8s)]
*  stuck and maybe you lose position. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11209.199999999999s)]
*  So things change because of this barrier. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11211.199999999999s)]
*  And it's a shitty barrier to see through. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11214.32s)]
*  It was hardcore in the fucking beginning, bro, because we're in a fucking cage, bro. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11215.88s)]
*  That's also why I think it had a hard time gaining acceptance. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11220.84s)]
*  Because you're locked in a fucking cage. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11223.16s)]
*  Dude, when I was first doing comedy, Dana and I talk about this all the time. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11225.279999999999s)]
*  When we first got involved in the UFC, it was like telling people that you're involved [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11228.359999999999s)]
*  in porn. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11231.4s)]
*  That's what it was like. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11232.4s)]
*  They're like, what are you doing? [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11234.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11235.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11236.0s)]
*  Not that long ago. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11237.0s)]
*  Cage fighting? [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11238.0s)]
*  You're involved in cage fighting? [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11239.0s)]
*  Was that early 2000s or 90s? [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11240.0s)]
*  Late 90s? [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11242.039999999999s)]
*  Dude, I first did, the first event I did was in 97. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11243.039999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11246.8s)]
*  I remember seeing the old school pic, the videos and shit. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11247.8s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11250.119999999999s)]
*  97. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11251.119999999999s)]
*  I was three. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11252.119999999999s)]
*  You were a baby. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11253.119999999999s)]
*  I was three. [[03:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11254.119999999999s)]
*  You were a baby. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11255.119999999999s)]
*  And I was in Dothan, Alabama, with a fucking microphone. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11256.119999999999s)]
*  I had no coaching. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11259.8s)]
*  No one told me what to do. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11261.279999999999s)]
*  I wrote a bunch of questions out on a piece of paper so I wouldn't fuck it up. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11262.4s)]
*  I can't fuck this up. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11265.84s)]
*  I can't choke. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11266.84s)]
*  Because if I get in front of Mark Coleman, I might fucking panic. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11267.84s)]
*  And I did. [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11270.24s)]
*  I fucking completely panicked. [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11271.24s)]
*  But luckily I had questions, and a good one. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11272.76s)]
*  I had some prepared questions. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11275.0s)]
*  How important it was for him to be the first wrestler to win the UFC heavyweight title. [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11276.92s)]
*  He was like, oh, that's a good question. [[03:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11280.56s)]
*  So we're all right. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11282.56s)]
*  But it was like him after he smashed Dan Severn. [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11283.56s)]
*  He's looking at me like, who the fuck are you? [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11285.92s)]
*  And this is like bare-knuckle times. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11287.8s)]
*  Bare-knuckle, headbutts, wrestling shoes on. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11290.72s)]
*  It was a totally different world. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11293.84s)]
*  Yeah, but that was intimidating as fuck. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11295.4s)]
*  Intimidating as fuck. [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11297.2s)]
*  Walking in there. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11298.2s)]
*  It was live. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11299.2s)]
*  Live on TV. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11300.2s)]
*  Yes, live on pay-per-view. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11301.2s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11302.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's crazy. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11303.2s)]
*  I'm an idiot. [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11304.2s)]
*  We're still all fucking idiots. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11305.2s)]
*  And it was like, back then, it was so raw. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11308.08s)]
*  It was so raw. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11311.92s)]
*  It was like UFC 12. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11312.92s)]
*  It was so raw. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11313.92s)]
*  The experience was so... [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11315.92s)]
*  Dudes were grabbing shorts. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11316.92s)]
*  I remember while Ead Ishmael fought this guy, and the guy gave him this crazy wedgie. [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11318.52s)]
*  He was grabbing his jockstrap and shoving it up his ass while he was fighting him. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11321.56s)]
*  You could grab clothes. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11326.039999999999s)]
*  When Trey Telligman fought Vitor, he didn't have gloves on. [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11328.16s)]
*  Because you could pick, right? [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11330.64s)]
*  He tried to fight bare-knuckle. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11331.64s)]
*  Yeah, you could say gloves or no gloves. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11332.64s)]
*  Or one. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11334.56s)]
*  Like the fucking one, dude. [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11335.56s)]
*  Most of those guys were going no gloves. [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11336.56s)]
*  Fuck that. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11338.279999999999s)]
*  And they could headbutt. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11339.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, a nut shot, right? [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11340.279999999999s)]
*  Or no? [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11341.279999999999s)]
*  Is that the only one? [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11342.279999999999s)]
*  Nut shots were still legal. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11343.279999999999s)]
*  Fuck that. [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11344.279999999999s)]
*  For the first bunch of fights, nut shots were legal. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11345.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know when they stopped, but I remember Keith Hackney versus Joe Son. [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11347.080000000002s)]
*  Joe Son had Keith Hackney in a headlock, and Keith Hackney just punched him in the nuts [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11351.080000000002s)]
*  over and over again. [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11355.68s)]
*  Just straight shots in the nuts. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11357.320000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't compete. [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11360.880000000001s)]
*  I would not be in the UFC now. [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11361.880000000001s)]
*  Headbutts, groin shots. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11363.76s)]
*  I don't even like stomps on the ground. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11365.84s)]
*  I'm glad that's not in the UFC. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11367.880000000001s)]
*  You don't like it? [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11369.6s)]
*  You think it should be illegal? [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11370.6s)]
*  I like the UFC rules right now. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11372.800000000001s)]
*  I think... [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11374.720000000001s)]
*  What if you were really good at stomps? [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11375.76s)]
*  I bet you'd be really good at stomps. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11376.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I don't really take people down much. [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11378.76s)]
*  But if you kick someone's legs out from under them? [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11381.56s)]
*  And then stomp them? [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11384.56s)]
*  Oh, I'd rather choke them. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11385.56s)]
*  I'd rather fucking Darce choke them or something. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11386.56s)]
*  But in certain opportunities, it is a weapon that you would use. [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11389.56s)]
*  Like if you were in a life or death situation, it's certainly an effective weapon to use [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11393.08s)]
*  in some positions. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11397.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean dude, when people are trying to get up against the cage, and you're kind [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11398.96s)]
*  of standing over them, a nasty fucking soccer kick. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11402.720000000001s)]
*  This is why I say basketball court. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11406.2s)]
*  No cage to get up on. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11408.6s)]
*  No cage to get up on. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11409.68s)]
*  You don't get your head trapped. [[03:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11410.800000000001s)]
*  I feel like I would be... [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11411.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so here's Keith Acne and John. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11412.800000000001s)]
*  Oh God. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11414.800000000001s)]
*  Nuts shots, bro. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11415.800000000001s)]
*  UFC 4. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11416.800000000001s)]
*  Look at these straight shots to the junk. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11417.800000000001s)]
*  No cup, right? [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11419.800000000001s)]
*  Straight shots to the junk. [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11420.800000000001s)]
*  Even, well, it looks like you might wear a cup, but still. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11421.800000000001s)]
*  That fucking hurt your hand, Pryv. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11425.04s)]
*  Dude. [[03:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11426.6s)]
*  But dude, a basketball court, I feel like I'd be dominant. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11427.6s)]
*  I feel like no one would fuck with me if they couldn't take me down. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11430.32s)]
*  If someone couldn't get me up against the cage and take me down, I don't see motherfuckers. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11432.96s)]
*  Also if someone did take you down, you'd have to earn getting back up to your feet. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11437.08s)]
*  You can't use the cage. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11440.84s)]
*  You'd have to try to get back up to your feet from being flat on your back on the ground. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11441.84s)]
*  I feel like I would be good at that, just creating a scramble, going triangle and lollata, [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11446.32s)]
*  like very active off my back. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11451.32s)]
*  I feel like that would benefit me. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11453.08s)]
*  You know what would be really wild? [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11454.6s)]
*  If people did what Gordon Ryan is doing in MMA, and challenged people to no time limit [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11456.18s)]
*  fights. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11460.8s)]
*  No rounds. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11462.279999999999s)]
*  No time limit. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11463.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, fuck that. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11465.279999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't really... [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11467.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11469.279999999999s)]
*  God, you get some... [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11471.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, who would dominate the sport? [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11475.279999999999s)]
*  Fucking... [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11479.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11480.279999999999s)]
*  The guys the best, fucking just gas tanks. [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11482.279999999999s)]
*  Guys who the best at managing distance, or managing their energy, and also I think the [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11485.76s)]

*  Unlimited rounds or no rounds? [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11493.76s)]
*  Just one? [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11495.36s)]
*  Just one. [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11496.36s)]
*  Damn. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11497.36s)]
*  The thing is though, if you can't take the guy down, and if there's no cage, if you can't [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11498.36s)]
*  take the guy down and there's no cage, and you're moving towards him and every time he's [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11502.94s)]
*  whack, whack, he's chopping at those legs, whack, whack, you can't corner him anywhere, [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11507.400000000001s)]
*  and he's moving, and he's backing away, and he's got plenty of room behind him, and plenty [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11512.88s)]
*  of room... [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11515.76s)]
*  Like space is not an option anymore, it's not an issue at all. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11516.76s)]
*  We're talking about a giant arena, and a big center area, and the fighters meet in the very [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11519.4s)]
*  center, and there's very clear out of bounds lines. [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11524.32s)]
*  But they're far, I'd feel very confident. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11527.98s)]
*  That would be a completely different sport, right? [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11530.2s)]
*  But that would be a sport... [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11533.12s)]
*  Like imagine if you played basketball, but there was like fucking shelves in the middle [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11534.12s)]
*  of the court, right? [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11537.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11538.56s)]
*  You'd be so stupid. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11539.56s)]
*  Like why is the shelf there? [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11540.56s)]
*  I could just fucking coast through this empty space, but instead there's a desk and a table. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11542.039999999999s)]
*  Objects. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11546.64s)]
*  That's dumb. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11547.64s)]
*  Like why is there a cage? [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11548.64s)]
*  It sucks to see. [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11549.64s)]
*  Yeah, you can never pay-per-view that, huh? [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11550.64s)]
*  It's timeless. [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11552.119999999999s)]
*  If you're there live, it's the shit, because the energy's insane. [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11553.119999999999s)]
*  But how many times are you looking up at the big screen? [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11556.439999999999s)]
*  Especially if they're fighting in that little corner area, where the post is. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11558.199999999999s)]
*  I can't see shit. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11562.359999999999s)]
*  I'm five feet away, and I'm looking at a screen. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11563.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the cage does fuck with it. [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11566.68s)]
*  And then the ref sometimes. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11568.16s)]
*  He's gotta be right there, but I guess that has to be the case anyway. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11570.32s)]
*  Well some refs, there's some shit, like some eye pokes, they just can't see. [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11573.76s)]
*  They have to make a judgment call on the spot. [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11578.039999999999s)]
*  Fuck, being a ref would be tough. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11580.039999999999s)]
*  What did you think about Goddard's call? [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11581.88s)]
*  I think first of all, Mark Goddard's one of the best ever. [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11583.72s)]
*  He's fucking phenomenal. [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11586.24s)]
*  I agree with him almost always. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11587.56s)]
*  I don't think I've ever dissed him. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11589.2s)]
*  Everyone's gonna make a bad call every now and again or do something, but I think that [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11591.28s)]
*  guy is as good as they get. [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11594.48s)]
*  When he stopped the fight, a lot of people were like, damn, I don't know. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11596.52s)]
*  Maybe he could have let it go a little longer. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11600.88s)]
*  I think the ref has to know which guys are capable of a what. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11602.9s)]
*  Obviously, he knows Alex Paheta is so dangerous. [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11608.08s)]
*  I like Izzy so much, I was okay with the stoppage. [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11611.84s)]
*  I just feel like Izzy's a good dude. [[03:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11616.6s)]
*  I've met him a few times. [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11618.119999999999s)]
*  I really fucking like him. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11619.119999999999s)]
*  I think he's a good human. [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11620.119999999999s)]
*  I like what he's doing. [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11621.119999999999s)]
*  I think he's a great champion. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11622.119999999999s)]
*  I think he's a great champion in the fact if Alex would have KO'd him clean, that would [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11623.12s)]
*  have been very hard to see. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11628.08s)]
*  And he could have hit him with a knee. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11629.36s)]
*  Oh, it could have been bad. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11631.480000000001s)]
*  Izzy was head down, moving like that and wasn't moving very fast. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11633.08s)]
*  I know his mind was there, but his body was not moving fast anymore. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11638.04s)]
*  He got clipped with some big shots. [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11641.320000000002s)]
*  I think it was a good stoppage. [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11643.560000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11644.880000000001s)]
*  But I could see how Izzy would say, bring back Steve Moskowitz. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11645.880000000001s)]
*  Because I think he was saying that, I saw a clip, he was saying that before the fight. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11651.2s)]
*  He was saying, I hope Steve Maserati, Maserati. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11655.400000000001s)]
*  I saw Derrick Luzer. [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11658.76s)]
*  Steve was in the fight so he could tee off on Alex and not have the fight stop. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11660.240000000002s)]
*  Then he could just keep beating up Alex. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11663.92s)]
*  He said that before the fight. [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11665.400000000001s)]
*  Then I heard him say it after the fight. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11666.720000000001s)]
*  So I think he was kind of being funny, but I also was like. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11668.320000000002s)]
*  Oh, he was definitely being funny. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11671.16s)]
*  But he was also saying, look, he's a champion. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11672.480000000001s)]
*  Of course he's going to think that he could survive. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11674.68s)]
*  He's like, if I make it out of that round, anything could have happened. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11677.220000000001s)]
*  He starts circling around. [[03:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11680.560000000001s)]
*  You never fucking know. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11681.720000000001s)]
*  You never know. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11683.04s)]
*  But it wasn't trending well. [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11684.04s)]
*  Very fast, negative. [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11685.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, very bad. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11686.720000000001s)]
*  And that guy is a fucking murderous puncher. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11688.0s)]
*  And also, we saw that knee that he landed on Willnis. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11691.28s)]
*  Imagine landing that there. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11694.24s)]
*  Especially up against the cage, he's kind of moving around. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11695.24s)]
*  Not looking too sharp. [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11698.48s)]
*  It sucks because for Izzy, he's such a good fighter. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11701.44s)]
*  The only time he was really in danger is when he was up against the cage. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11704.04s)]
*  And it's like, that's the skill is not getting put up against the cage. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11706.76s)]
*  And he did such a good job doing that. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11711.279999999999s)]
*  And then 23 minutes into the fight. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11713.32s)]
*  What was those calf kicks? [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11715.8s)]
*  Yeah, he got hit with those calf kicks early on. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11717.039999999999s)]
*  I watched that again. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11718.76s)]
*  And the first go see if you could see if there's like a video showing Alex [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11720.199999999999s)]
*  Paheda first round calf kicks. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11723.96s)]
*  He landed like five or six of them in a row. [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11725.92s)]
*  Yeah, they were hard. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11728.679999999998s)]
*  And he kind of member bonus. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11730.08s)]
*  He's got that real sneaky way of doing it, man. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11731.679999999998s)]
*  He's not like looking at your calf at all. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11734.52s)]
*  He's distracting you with certain movements. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11738.0s)]
*  And there's no wind up to it. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11740.4s)]
*  And it just fucking slams home. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11741.720000000001s)]
*  And he checked a lot of the ones that Izzy threw. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11743.68s)]
*  Which hurt. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11746.76s)]
*  Yes, dude. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11747.6s)]
*  His checks were on point. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11749.04s)]
*  He was always lifting his shin up. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11750.2s)]
*  Always. [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11751.84s)]
*  With every time Izzy's throwing kicks, he's lifting his shin up. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11753.04s)]
*  It's like, you got to think that guy was tuned in for glory kickboxing. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11755.800000000001s)]
*  Two division champion. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11760.44s)]
*  So he's fighting all those guys that are kicking the shit out of each other. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11761.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11764.48s)]
*  I mean, and no takedowns at all. [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11765.0s)]
*  So you have to be like so on point with your checks. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11767.0s)]
*  I feel like Izzy had so many. [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11769.88s)]
*  Like, I go back to when I said I want to be well rounded. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11772.88s)]
*  I want to be known. [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11775.84s)]
*  I can do everything. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11776.6s)]
*  I can grapple. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11777.24s)]
*  I can fucking wrestle. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11777.68s)]
*  I can strike. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11778.48s)]
*  He had so many opportunities. [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11779.84s)]
*  Alex is a big motherfucker, though. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11781.52s)]
*  He had opportunities to wrestle. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11783.88s)]
*  He was in the clinches. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11785.199999999999s)]
*  He was in certain positions to be able to, you know. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11786.08s)]
*  Well, that second round when he had his back, man. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11788.52s)]
*  I mean, he had the potential to land big shots, too. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11791.28s)]
*  He was riding his back for quite a while. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11793.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11795.080000000002s)]
*  But imagine, I mean, like even in the third, fourth, third, he had, they were in the clinch. [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11795.960000000001s)]
*  There were options for him to wrestle where Alex, who knows, if he has the certain skill [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11799.400000000001s)]
*  set to defend even like a lower level wrestler. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11805.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11807.960000000001s)]
*  Like, I feel like if Izzy was just a better wrestler, easier said than done. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11808.480000000001s)]
*  But also you got to think Pahetta probably didn't train a lot of wrestling for this camp. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11813.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11818.28s)]
*  He probably felt this was going to be a stand up war. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11818.6s)]
*  That's what Izzy does in all of his fights. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11821.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11822.640000000001s)]
*  Izzy almost got him in the first round. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11823.640000000001s)]
*  Dude. [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11825.720000000001s)]
*  Almost got him. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11826.2s)]
*  That left hook landed like right at the bell maybe after. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11826.76s)]
*  But if there was one or two seconds left and he threw a right hand to right, left, boom, [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11828.92s)]
*  that right could have fucking just. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11832.6s)]
*  It could have been over. [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11833.720000000001s)]
*  Oh, God, imagine. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11834.68s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11836.32s)]
*  It could have been like the Derek Brunson KO. [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11837.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11839.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, Izzy gets sharp when he sees he's a sniper. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11839.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11843.28s)]
*  That Derek Brunson, that KO was a thing of beauty. [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11843.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11846.68s)]
*  It was just perfect precision. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11847.12s)]
*  Just pop, pop, pop, pop. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11848.64s)]
*  Like moves in on him and just, oh my goodness. [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11850.52s)]
*  Yeah, he had him. [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11853.8s)]
*  I mean, he had him. [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11854.72s)]
*  He had him with zero time. [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11855.64s)]
*  Literally, yeah, no seconds left. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11857.56s)]
*  Perfect right hand, wobbles, left hook, bam. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11858.48s)]
*  He was hurt. [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11862.08s)]
*  He was seriously hurt. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11863.8s)]
*  Really hurt. [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11865.28s)]
*  He recovered well. [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11865.92s)]
*  Yeah, must have been in good fucking shape. [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11867.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11868.72s)]
*  He recovered well and that, I mean, he got so fortunate that the bell was right there. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11869.24s)]
*  I mean, imagine if that was like two minutes into the fight, he cracks him with that. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11874.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he definitely dealt with some adversity. [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11876.84s)]
*  I mean, yeah, the round where Izzy had his back. [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11878.199999999999s)]
*  Did he ever have hooks in and was trying to choke or did he just kind of ride him, standing on top throwing? [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11880.359999999999s)]
*  I don't remember if he had two hooks. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11884.359999999999s)]
*  He was on the back for a long time and he was flowing back and forth in different positions. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11886.64s)]
*  But holding the top position in a way that he like, I mean, I'm sure Izzy's really good at grappling, but he's not known for it. [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11891.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11897.279999999999s)]
*  He's known for being able to survive on his back and get up on his feet and stuff Marvin Vittori's take on at times. [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11897.72s)]
*  Impressive. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11904.279999999999s)]
*  Alex fucking took Izzy down, didn't he? [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11905.12s)]
*  He hit a double A. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11906.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11907.76s)]
*  He did. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11908.560000000001s)]
*  He did. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11909.960000000001s)]
*  No, the rounds. [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11910.320000000002s)]
*  I think that was the end of the first round, right? [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11911.04s)]
*  End of the first round, he was getting knocked out or damn near knocked out. [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11913.28s)]
*  Was it end of the second round? [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11915.800000000001s)]
*  Might have been. [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11916.720000000001s)]
*  End of the second round. [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11917.2s)]
*  That's right. [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11917.880000000001s)]
*  End of the first round, he almost got knocked out. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11918.2s)]
*  But yeah, Alex took him down. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11919.560000000001s)]
*  That was some adversity. [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11921.68s)]
*  I mean, that's impressive. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11922.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11924.960000000001s)]
*  And now, I mean, what do you do? [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11925.240000000002s)]
*  I mean, the rematch is very compelling, right? [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11928.0s)]
*  It was a very close fight. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11930.68s)]
*  In fact, Izzy was ahead three rounds to one. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11931.720000000001s)]
*  Going into the fourth. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11934.72s)]
*  But it was always that the feeling of danger was always there. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11935.96s)]
*  When Paheta was like march towards him and get him close to the cage. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11939.68s)]
*  Like, Jesus Christ. [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11943.36s)]
*  So in the rematch, Izzy is going to be way more careful with that calf kick. [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11945.56s)]
*  Right. [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11950.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11951.12s)]
*  So what does he do differently? [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11951.4s)]
*  Izzy can fight Southpaw. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11953.48s)]
*  That's one thing. [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11955.24s)]
*  I mean, he does fight Southpaw very well. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11956.52s)]
*  He could fight from any position. [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11958.32s)]
*  Or yeah, does he wrestle more? [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11960.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11962.28s)]
*  What does he do? [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11962.56s)]
*  But wrestling is so much easier said than done. [[03:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11964.04s)]
*  Wrestling is such a hard, hard work, especially with that switch knee [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11966.44s)]
*  that dude throws and just fucking so dangerous. [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11969.96s)]
*  Well, now he knows like what went wrong. [[03:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11972.96s)]
*  Right. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11974.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11975.36s)]
*  You know, you cannot be compromised when you're with that guy. [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11975.76s)]
*  Right. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11978.96s)]
*  So he's got to move around. [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11979.52s)]
*  And then Paheta is going to know he can do it again. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11980.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11983.28s)]
*  He's going to know he can do it again. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11983.84s)]
*  He did it again. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11984.84s)]
*  He knocked him out two fights in a row, knocked him out in kickboxing, [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11985.84s)]
*  and knocked him out in MMA for the world title. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11988.28s)]
*  That's it. He's going to know he can do it again. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11990.24s)]
*  But what do you do if you're the UFC? [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11992.12s)]
*  Do you risk Paheta against a Marvin Vittori or Paheta against a Robert Whitaker? [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11994.16s)]
*  Because if Izzy doesn't fight him right away, [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=11998.92s)]
*  and one of those guys is really good at wrestling. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12000.8s)]
*  I mean, Hamsot's moving up to 85, too, right? [[03:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12003.8s)]
*  Who makes the most money in that division? [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12006.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, right now, probably Izzy just because he's been champ for so long. [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12008.24s)]
*  But Hamsot's a fucking problem. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12011.8s)]
*  He's a problem. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12014.76s)]
*  I thought they were going to take Hamsot and give him one more chance at 170. [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12015.56s)]
*  Well, Colby, right? [[03:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12020.800000000001s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12022.08s)]
*  I think that... [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12023.880000000001s)]
*  Well, Colby could fight at 85, too, if he chose to. [[03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12024.48s)]
*  No. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12026.6s)]
*  If he chose to. [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12027.48s)]
*  I think Colby probably walks around fucking 190. [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12028.4s)]
*  Right. [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12031.24s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he could. [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12032.16s)]
*  Skill-wise, he's fucking definitely skilled enough to. [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12032.960000000001s)]
*  But if he just chose to not cut weight at all, it's not like it's impossible. [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12035.0s)]
*  He's not a small guy. [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12039.0s)]
*  He's just real lean. [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12040.08s)]
*  Oh, I've never been around him in person, [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12041.52s)]
*  but he doesn't seem like he cuts a ton for 170. [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12043.28s)]
*  Well, his pace is so crazy that he can't be drained. [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12046.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12049.44s)]
*  He just breaks people. [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12051.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12053.119999999999s)]
*  He says he always throws punches like 50, 60%. [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12053.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12056.599999999999s)]
*  Everything's 50, 60%. [[03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12057.039999999999s)]
*  God, oh yeah. [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12058.64s)]
*  He hasn't fought... [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12059.359999999999s)]
*  According to ESPN, Brett Akamoto, he has asked for Pereira in January at UFC 283 in Brazil [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12060.0s)]
*  and then said he would turn around two months later to fight Colby in March. [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12068.0s)]
*  Who? Hamsot? [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12071.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12072.64s)]
*  See, they're not going to give Hamsot a title shot at 185. [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12073.76s)]
*  If they did give Hamsot a title shot in Brazil and he strangles Pejada in front of the Brazilians, [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12076.36s)]
*  good luck getting out of there. [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12082.44s)]
*  Dude, Pejada ain't taking that fight. [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12084.0s)]
*  Don't take that fight. [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12086.44s)]
*  Listen, the Izzy fight is the big money fight anyway. [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12087.960000000001s)]
*  That's the big money fight. [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12090.28s)]
*  Well, he gets pay-per-view now. [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12091.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's the champion. [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12092.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12093.640000000001s)]
*  It's amazing. [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12094.800000000001s)]
*  Look, I was a giant fan of that guy before he ever fought in MMA. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12095.560000000001s)]
*  And when he fought in MMA, I was so happy. [[03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12098.36s)]
*  I remember you saying that early before he even got signed, [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12100.36s)]
*  or right as he got signed or something. [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12102.44s)]
*  He's the outlier of all outliers when it comes to striking. [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12104.6s)]
*  He's that power outlier. [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12108.4s)]
*  You watch his... [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12110.119999999999s)]
*  See, find his highlight KO reel. [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12110.92s)]
*  Bro, it's preposterous. [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12113.72s)]
*  His highlight KO reel is like, what is he doing? [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12115.96s)]
*  How is he hitting them so hard? [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12119.72s)]
*  It's like when Deontay Wilder KO's people, you're like, what the fuck, man? [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12121.24s)]
*  He touches them. [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12126.039999999999s)]
*  Deontay knocked that dude off balance, and he hit him with one of these. [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12126.84s)]
*  Blap! [[03:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12130.88s)]
*  And the dude just was dead. [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12131.6s)]
*  I feel like that long... [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12134.56s)]
*  Tommy Hearns. [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12136.4s)]
*  The length, that snap, and the punch. [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12137.08s)]
*  But his is also snappy and heavy. [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12139.800000000001s)]
*  Heavy. [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12142.08s)]
*  It's a dangerous combination. [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12142.6s)]
*  Yeah, because he's a big guy, and he's also long. [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12143.44s)]
*  A big fella. [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12146.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12147.16s)]
*  He's, you know, even when he was like 209, [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12147.6s)]
*  he fought Tyson Fury the first fight. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12150.04s)]
*  He was 209 and flattened Tyson. [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12151.48s)]
*  That was... [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12153.880000000001s)]
*  Crazy! [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12155.56s)]
*  Did you see Tyson Fury's dad yelling at Jake, took his shirt off, [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12157.12s)]
*  and was yelling at him in the boxing ring? [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12161.400000000001s)]
*  Really? [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12163.84s)]
*  You didn't see that? [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12164.24s)]
*  No. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12164.720000000001s)]
*  Jamie, you gotta pull that up. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12165.24s)]
*  What did we ask you to pull up first, though? [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12166.36s)]
*  Oh, get the... [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12168.16s)]
*  No, no, no, Pahetta. [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12170.2s)]
*  Alex Pahetta KO reel. [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12171.800000000001s)]
*  KO highlight reel. [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12174.16s)]
*  No, we should show the Jason Willness one, that one. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12176.0s)]
*  But there's a shitload of them, and they're all like that. [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12178.640000000001s)]
*  What's his record? [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12181.6s)]
*  Kickboxing glory or just kickboxing? [[03:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12182.52s)]
*  He definitely lost. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12183.92s)]
*  He lost to Willness by decision. [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12184.800000000001s)]
*  He lost to a few guys. [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12186.560000000001s)]
*  He lost to Vaitov, who's elite in his last fight. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12187.640000000001s)]
*  And that was a split decision right before he came over to MMA. [[03:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12190.800000000001s)]
*  And then he fought that one fight in LFA. [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12194.76s)]
*  He won that fight. [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12197.44s)]
*  And then they signed him to the UFC. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12198.92s)]
*  Andrew Tate knocked out Pahetta. [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12200.68s)]
*  So look at this. [[03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12202.2s)]
*  These KOs. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12203.0s)]
*  Did he really? [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12203.76s)]
*  What? [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12204.800000000001s)]
*  What are you saying? [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12205.52s)]
*  Oh, that left hook. [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12206.52s)]
*  Dude, that... [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12209.44s)]
*  And that's Simon Marcus. [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12210.0s)]
*  Simon Marcus is a bad motherfucker, dude. [[03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12211.08s)]
*  That left hook, dude. [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12214.52s)]
*  But I don't think he knocked Simon Marcus out here. [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12215.56s)]
*  I think he just dropped him. [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12219.52s)]
*  Top 10 kickboxing knockout. [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12220.6s)]
*  But he knocked everybody out. [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12222.52s)]
*  Dude, that left hook. [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12223.6s)]
*  Come on, son. [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12224.64s)]
*  But look what happens when he hits people. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12225.56s)]
*  Like, look what happens. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12227.32s)]
*  They just go off. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12229.0s)]
*  He's so good at fucking going downstairs, upstairs. [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12230.439999999999s)]
*  That right to the body left hook. [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12234.32s)]
*  Look at it. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12235.92s)]
*  Bink. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12236.24s)]
*  Boom. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12236.8s)]
*  My goodness. [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12238.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that is a gnarly left hook. [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12238.76s)]
*  And that's the Izzy one. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12240.52s)]
*  Fuck, I've seen that about 400 times. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12241.76s)]
*  Yeah, you don't need to see that one again. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12243.08s)]
*  Let's see this one. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12244.279999999999s)]
*  This one. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12245.48s)]
*  Boom. [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12247.68s)]
*  Just a sniper right hand. [[03:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12248.359999999999s)]
*  That left hook would have been bad. [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12249.4s)]
*  It's just the power he generates. [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12253.64s)]
*  It's the same kind of thing that we were talking about [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12255.84s)]
*  with Deontay, that long frame, but heavily muscled. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12257.92s)]
*  Check. [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12261.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're right about that. [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12263.76s)]
*  Oh. [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12265.44s)]
*  Once you start feeling that thud, you're like, oh, Jesus [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12267.359999999999s)]
*  Christ. [[03:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12270.08s)]
*  Jesus. [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12271.279999999999s)]
*  He just puts it on you, man. [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12271.96s)]
*  That's how he's the outlier of outliers. [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12274.72s)]
*  Because there's extraordinary power. [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12277.24s)]
*  And then there's like, politan power. [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12279.12s)]
*  It's just everybody who gets hit is like, what the fuck, man? [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12281.28s)]
*  Looks like what the fuck. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12284.640000000001s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12285.76s)]
*  You got to see Tommy's dad yelling at Jake with his shirt [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12287.6s)]
*  off in the ring. [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12290.28s)]
*  Just looked coked up, just fucking having a, it's funny. [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12291.240000000002s)]
*  And Jake was sitting there talking, and his dad's fucking [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12296.04s)]
*  tits hanging, just yelling at him. [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12299.2s)]
*  You got to, I wonder if they'll show him just ripping his [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12303.08s)]
*  shirt. [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12305.84s)]
*  Nobody likes you. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12306.68s)]
*  You're embarrassing. [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12308.4s)]
*  Back it up. [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12311.0s)]
*  Back it up to the beginning so I can hear what he said [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12311.8s)]
*  at the first. [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12313.44s)]
*  Come fight me right now, bro. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12314.68s)]
*  That's a big boy. [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12317.6s)]
*  Look at him. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12318.64s)]
*  I'm the fucking king. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12322.4s)]
*  You're embarrassing. [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12323.92s)]
*  You're a fat, miserable old man. [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12325.8s)]
*  He looks nervous as hell. [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12327.84s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't watch the boxing fight, but I thought that was [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12329.52s)]
*  so fucking funny. [[03:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12332.359999999999s)]
*  Just ripping his shirt off in the middle of the boxing cage [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12333.32s)]
*  or ring. [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12335.96s)]
*  That's who those folks are. [[03:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12336.52s)]
*  They're fucking wild people. [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12337.92s)]
*  That's a wild family. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12339.84s)]
*  And for Tyson Fury to come out of that, man, that's strong [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12341.12s)]
*  stock. [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12343.960000000001s)]
*  That's strong stock. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12345.2s)]
*  That dude's fucking good. [[03:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12346.08s)]
*  He's fun to watch. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12348.4s)]
*  He's so massive, but so fucking quick-footed. [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12349.56s)]
*  When he fought Deontay in the last fight, he's standing [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12353.960000000001s)]
*  across the ring from him. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12357.08s)]
*  He goes, you're a bitch. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12357.960000000001s)]
*  You're a bitch. [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12359.6s)]
*  He's staring him down. [[03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12360.92s)]
*  You're a bitch. [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12361.88s)]
*  You're my bitch. [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12362.56s)]
*  And you can see Deontay was like, what the fuck, man? [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12363.88s)]
*  Because Deontay put on a lot of weight for that fight, [[03:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12366.720000000001s)]
*  didn't he? [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12368.720000000001s)]
*  Quite a bit for the second one. [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12369.6s)]
*  I'm thinking for the second one. [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12371.28s)]
*  It was the second or the third one [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12372.2s)]
*  that he was calling him a bitch. [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12373.44s)]
*  Oh, they have three? [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12374.44s)]
*  Don't they? [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12375.720000000001s)]
*  They might, actually. [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12377.0s)]
*  Was it the first one where Deontay dropped him? [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12378.4s)]
*  Yeah, the first one Deontay dropped him, they have three. [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12380.68s)]
*  And then he stopped him twice. [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12383.28s)]
*  He stopped him, and then he stopped him in the rematch. [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12385.36s)]
*  And then the rematch, the third match, rather, [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12387.36s)]
*  it's not a rubber match. [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12390.12s)]
*  The third match, I guess it kind of is because the first one [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12390.960000000001s)]
*  was a draw. [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12393.08s)]
*  But the third match, Deontay catches him hard. [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12393.84s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12397.8s)]
*  And hits him with that bomb of a right hand. [[03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12398.6s)]
*  And you see, literally, all the ripples of his fat go down. [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12400.4s)]
*  It was crazy, the impact of it. [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12404.68s)]
*  And then he dropped him again after that. [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12406.64s)]
*  But that right hand was a missile. [[03:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12408.72s)]
*  Yeah, that lengthy fucking power. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12411.36s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12415.0s)]
*  Tyson Fury is a motherfucker, dude. [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12415.76s)]
*  And so is Deontay. [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12417.52s)]
*  Any other world, Deontay is the unified champion, probably. [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12419.480000000001s)]
*  If Tyson Fury doesn't exist, because he's got that power. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12424.2s)]
*  Everybody goes out except for Tyson Fury. [[03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12428.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like if Francis and Tyson fought, [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12431.36s)]
*  I feel like Tyson might. [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12433.6s)]
*  I mean, Francis is always going to have a chance, [[03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12434.720000000001s)]
*  no matter what. [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12437.08s)]
*  He could fight anybody in the world, they have a chance. [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12437.800000000001s)]
*  But if it came to a boxing match, Tyson is so good. [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12440.12s)]
*  It's not an even matchup. [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12443.6s)]
*  And the gloves make it probably harder [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12446.36s)]
*  for him to win with one shot. [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12449.12s)]
*  He certainly is dangerous as fuck. [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12452.0s)]
*  Are you talking about this video? [[03:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12453.880000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, this one's great, though. [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12455.12s)]
*  This one's great. [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12457.12s)]
*  This is for Usyk. [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12458.480000000001s)]
*  Listen to what he says here. [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12459.44s)]
*  You want the WBC, and it's held by gypsies. [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12460.560000000001s)]
*  It is held by gypsies. [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12464.160000000002s)]
*  It's held by the gypsy king. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12465.400000000001s)]
*  And it's held tightly, grasped tight. [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12467.320000000002s)]
*  And all roads lead to a seven foot behemoth. [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12469.960000000001s)]
*  That will absolutely destroy you, middleweight. [[03:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12472.800000000001s)]
*  Middleweight, you will get smashed to bits. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12475.84s)]
*  Say you wanted to fight me after you beat the bodybuilder. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12480.28s)]
*  Call me out on television. [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12483.08s)]
*  And now you're being a little bitch pussy boy. [[03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12484.92s)]
*  Running, hiding, saying you've got injuries. [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12487.08s)]
*  You ain't got no injuries. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12489.960000000001s)]
*  You're at a sparring contest. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12490.92s)]
*  Get out and fight in December. [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12492.64s)]
*  You let your mouth go. [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12494.36s)]
*  Now let's back it up. [[03:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12495.52s)]
*  See if you can back it up, middleweight. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12496.4s)]
*  Doesn't matter if it's December, or April, or August next year. [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12498.28s)]
*  The outcome will be the same. [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12503.44s)]
*  I will obliterate you. [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12504.64s)]
*  I'm a seven foot, 20 stone behemoth. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12506.119999999999s)]
*  And I will destroy you, middleweight. [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12508.72s)]
*  Find your balls. [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12511.0s)]
*  Come see me. [[03:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12512.24s)]
*  That looks like a face filter on like in the spirit. [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12513.119999999999s)]
*  Find your balls. [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12515.08s)]
*  Come see me, bitch. [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12515.56s)]
*  What's he saying again? [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12517.359999999999s)]
*  A behemoth? [[03:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12518.08s)]
*  Do we figure out what he said? [[03:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12518.92s)]
*  He calls himself a seven foot behemoth. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12520.84s)]
*  Is that what that is? [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12523.76s)]
*  Tony Stone or something. [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12524.76s)]
*  Behemoth, is he saying, maybe? [[03:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12525.88s)]
*  A behemoth? [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12527.48s)]
*  Behemoth? [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12528.32s)]
*  Maybe he says it. [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12529.039999999999s)]
*  He's fucked up. [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12529.88s)]
*  That's the way the close caption had it. [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12530.4s)]
*  Yeah, it was behemoth. [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12531.84s)]
*  Let me hear him say it again. [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12533.0s)]
*  Bear moth? [[03:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12534.28s)]
*  He didn't say it. [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12535.12s)]
*  Let me hear him say it again. [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12535.640000000001s)]
*  Bear moth. [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12536.44s)]
*  And I will obliterate you. [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12537.16s)]
*  I'm a seven foot, 20 stone behemoth. [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12539.720000000001s)]
*  OK, behemoth. [[03:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12542.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was that. [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12543.640000000001s)]
*  Behemoth. [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12544.320000000002s)]
*  It didn't sound like bear moth. [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12544.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, maybe that's like a thing they say. [[03:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12545.800000000001s)]
*  He's a bear moth. [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12547.800000000001s)]
*  Kind of sounds. [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12548.960000000001s)]
*  A bear man, scary. [[03:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12549.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12551.12s)]
*  He's a, I mean, he's a seven foot bear. [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12551.640000000001s)]
*  Pretty much, fuck. [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12553.880000000001s)]
*  Well, who can move? [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12554.960000000001s)]
*  And he moves real quick. [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12556.04s)]
*  And he's skillful. [[03:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12557.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's sick to watch. [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12559.04s)]
*  I wonder how hard he's training out, like, just like on the weekly. [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12560.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12563.320000000002s)]
*  I've got to assume that he would think that a real fight is, like, [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12564.76s)]
*  very close to being signed. [[03:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12568.6s)]
*  He's got to be in some kind of shape. [[03:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12570.08s)]
*  He's not going to let himself get fat. [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12571.52s)]
*  Yeah, he's very disciplined. [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12573.400000000001s)]
*  Well, he has to be now, because it's like, this [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12574.720000000001s)]
*  is the last fight or two fights he's ever going to have, probably. [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12576.84s)]
*  He was ready to retire after the Dillion White fight, [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12579.400000000001s)]
*  and he decided to keep going. [[03:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12582.28s)]
*  But I think he's just going to keep going, [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12583.68s)]
*  because he thinks he can beat all those guys, too. [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12585.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, retirement is a scary thing. [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12587.320000000002s)]
*  It's a tricky one. [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12589.6s)]
*  I mean, look at Frankie. [[03:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12590.240000000002s)]
*  He's like, fuck. [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12591.2s)]
*  Do you think you know exactly when you want to get out? [[03:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12592.2s)]
*  I feel like I have a good team around me, [[03:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12596.0s)]
*  but I also know how competitive I am and how, like, I think I'm not a coach. [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12597.92s)]
*  I hate, like, I feel like I can't coach. [[03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12603.320000000002s)]
*  I do think it'll be fun to stick around. [[03:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12605.2s)]
*  And if Tim and I, once I retire, maybe, you know, [[03:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12608.36s)]
*  co-coach and build up someone, a student, [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12611.92s)]
*  if we can get, like, some great athlete. [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12614.640000000001s)]
*  Or maybe coaching might help kind of eat with that. [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12616.320000000002s)]
*  But I don't know. [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12620.36s)]
*  It's kind of scary to think about retirement, [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12622.6s)]
*  just because I fucking, I like being in camp, [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12625.039999999999s)]
*  and I like knowing there's a fight around the corner. [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12627.48s)]
*  For me to even think about maybe not fighting until, like, June, July, [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12630.199999999999s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, it's a long time. [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12632.84s)]
*  But I'm hoping. [[03:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12634.96s)]
*  You know, I definitely have the right people around me, [[03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12636.6s)]
*  but it's not even up to them, really. [[03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12639.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure Frankie has good people around. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12640.32s)]
*  It's just that competitiveness that, I don't know. [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12642.119999999999s)]
*  Or maybe, like, Connor, you just make so much fucking money, [[03:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12647.0s)]
*  and you just go do your own shit. [[03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12649.44s)]
*  But it seems like, clearly, he's still got a competitive drive. [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12651.6s)]
*  He's still working out really hard. [[03:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12654.04s)]
*  There's a bunch of videos of him wrestling, videos of him. [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12655.24s)]
*  He's kicking the bag with his fucked up leg, which is crazy. [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12658.720000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, and I think with a lot of those guys that get those pins, [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12662.16s)]
*  they have to make the decision whether to leave it in or to take it out. [[03:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12665.800000000001s)]
*  So have resurgie again to take it out? [[03:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12669.4s)]
*  Yes. Oh, fuck. [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12671.76s)]
*  Yes. [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12672.92s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if you're allowed to keep it in. [[03:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12674.560000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12677.68s)]
*  I don't know what kind of hardware they put in his shin. [[03:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12678.359999999999s)]
*  But I do know that some guys have had to have a second operation [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12681.8s)]
*  and take plates out. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12685.0s)]
*  Like, Tim Sylvia, I believe, had to, because his arm broke with Frank Mir. [[03:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12686.0s)]
*  That's gross. [[03:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12690.88s)]
*  And then there's Anderson. [[03:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12692.0s)]
*  He had his leg screwed back together. [[03:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12693.72s)]
*  Chris Wybman hasn't fought since he broke his leg against Uriah Hall. [[03:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12695.56s)]
*  Oh, he hasn't? [[03:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12699.199999999999s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[03:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12700.56s)]
*  I don't believe Chris has fought. [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12701.8s)]
*  I don't think Sylva took his out. [[03:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12703.56s)]
*  Sylva didn't? [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12704.96s)]
*  He did not? [[03:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12705.72s)]
*  Right now it says the doctor said it wouldn't have been a benefit either. [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12706.64s)]
*  Dude, another survey would have been... [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12709.56s)]
*  Well, it's not whether or not it's a benefit. [[03:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12711.0s)]
*  It's also whether or not it's fair. [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12712.96s)]
*  Like, if a guy has a titanium plate over his shin. [[03:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12714.96s)]
*  Dude. [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12718.24s)]
*  It's like, so it's going to be different in each case. [[03:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12719.119999999999s)]
*  So in some cases, the leg's going to be really compromised [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12723.039999999999s)]
*  to the point where the guy never feels confident about kicking with it again. [[03:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12725.4s)]
*  And Tyrone Spong, again, we said he fought that MMA fight with Caritona, [[03:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12728.84s)]
*  but I don't think he had other kickboxing fights [[03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12732.16s)]
*  after he broke his leg with Go Kansaki. [[03:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12734.080000000002s)]
*  So it's like, can you throw a kick with that leg? [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12736.36s)]
*  And if you can't throw a kick with that leg, [[03:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12738.68s)]
*  is it OK then that you have the plate still? [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12740.400000000001s)]
*  Because the leg's already fucked up anyway? [[03:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12743.68s)]
*  Like, is it balance it out? [[03:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12747.04s)]
*  Or did you get that plate put in and you had full recovery? [[03:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12748.480000000001s)]
*  And now you're smashing things with a shin that also has a plate in it. [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12752.36s)]
*  Fuck, I'd feel a lot more confident if I knew I had metal shins. [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12757.720000000001s)]
*  Which you know, because you also have screws. [[03:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12760.76s)]
*  So there's these fucking screws in your shin. [[03:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12763.160000000002s)]
*  Do those compromise your shin? [[03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12764.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[03:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12765.880000000001s)]
*  I was just picturing. [[03:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12766.68s)]
*  I remember when I had my Liz Frank surgery on my foot, [[03:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12768.0s)]
*  you know, there was an option. [[03:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12770.0s)]
*  The two surgeries was the one where they put the screws in or whatever, [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12771.480000000001s)]
*  and then they have to redo the surgery or yeah, surgery and take them out [[03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12774.68s)]
*  or do whatever I did. [[03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12778.560000000001s)]
*  I did what I did. [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12780.28s)]
*  So I don't have any metal in my foot. [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12780.960000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[03:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12782.240000000002s)]
*  How long did that take you to recover from? [[03:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12784.44s)]
*  Dude, the Liz Frank surgery took legitimately two years to start to stop hurting. [[03:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12785.84s)]
*  But I was probably training on it too soon. [[03:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12791.64s)]
*  I probably wasn't doing exactly everything. [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12795.359999999999s)]
*  This was 2018. [[03:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12797.199999999999s)]
*  So I was kind of learning about eating healthy and I was still learning a lot of stuff. [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12798.279999999999s)]
*  So I might not have taken care of it the best way. [[03:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12803.599999999999s)]
*  But legit, two fucking years, that foot hurt so bad. [[03:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12805.8s)]
*  Like I would train and it would just ache. [[03:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12810.24s)]
*  I would have to ice it every day. [[03:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12812.72s)]
*  It was miserable. [[03:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12814.439999999999s)]
*  The fucking Liz Frank surgery was miserable. [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12816.08s)]
*  What is specifically the injury that causes that surgery? [[03:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12819.36s)]
*  So that happened in my fight when I was laying on my back talking to you. [[03:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12823.199999999999s)]
*  So I threw the head kick. [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12826.44s)]
*  And then right when I threw the head kick, I planted and threw a right hand. [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12828.24s)]
*  And my foot snapped when I landed. [[03:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12831.039999999999s)]
*  So it's the bones in the middle of the foot. [[03:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12833.56s)]
*  Yeah, and the tendons and shit. [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12835.68s)]
*  Oh, God, it was so fucking... [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12838.44s)]
*  Jesus. [[03:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12841.24s)]
*  Yeah, that one was fucked. [[03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12842.0s)]
*  And then I remember I got like I had to get like an extra... [[03:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12844.08s)]
*  I remember I went to the Vegas doctor after the fight and they said, [[03:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12847.320000000002s)]
*  no, you're fine. [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12851.36s)]
*  And then they told Dana, oh, his foot's fine. [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12852.52s)]
*  And then Dana said at the post-fight conference, like my foot was fine. [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12855.76s)]
*  I got carried out in a stretcher and everyone was making fun of me. [[03:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12858.36s)]
*  But yeah, my fucking foot snapped in half. [[03:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12862.08s)]
*  And then I went to another doctor in Arizona. [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12864.480000000001s)]
*  They did x-rays and shit and they're like, oh, it's fine. [[03:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12867.0s)]
*  So it was like the third doctor I went to, they're like, oh, your foot's torn in half. [[03:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12869.2s)]
*  How the fuck are these doctors not fucking finding this? [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12873.16s)]
*  It's like you're a fucking... Yeah. [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12877.32s)]
*  So how... It was two years before there was no pain. [[03:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12878.68s)]
*  How long before you had full movement? [[03:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12881.16s)]
*  Um... [[03:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12883.2s)]
*  I don't even remember. [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12886.48s)]
*  I just remember fucking definitely... [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12888.08s)]
*  I wasn't able to run for like two years, like grappling, just bouncing around hurt. [[03:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12890.28s)]
*  But I could still do it. [[03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12894.68s)]
*  But I was like, I was like just doing it through the pain. [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12895.800000000001s)]
*  I'd always have to rap in a certain way. [[03:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12899.04s)]
*  I don't even remember that. [[03:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12902.76s)]
*  And so what was it like fighting with that? [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12903.84s)]
*  So now it feels really... Now it feels fine. [[03:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12905.880000000001s)]
*  I feel like I feel it if I'm really eating bad. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12909.48s)]
*  Did you have any fights where it came up after that? [[03:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12912.52s)]
*  No. It's been... I haven't had any issues with it. [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12916.68s)]
*  So from that injury, how long was it before you fought again? [[03:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12919.32s)]
*  Two years. [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12923.08s)]
*  Two solid years. [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12923.880000000001s)]
*  2018 to 2020. [[03:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12924.76s)]
*  Wow. [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12926.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I got... Remember I had gotten suspended from the Ostrine. [[03:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12927.16s)]
*  Right. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12930.64s)]
*  Which worked out perfect in a way because I was dealing with this... [[03:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12932.24s)]
*  I booked a fight like a year or something later. [[03:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12936.32s)]
*  I was supposed to fight Jose Quinones. [[03:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12939.08s)]
*  And I was going into that fight super fucked up. [[03:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12941.88s)]
*  My foot was in so much pain. [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12945.039999999999s)]
*  And I was going into that fight and I was a couple of weeks out before I got suspended. [[03:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12947.4s)]
*  And then... [[03:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12952.039999999999s)]
*  So I couldn't fight because the suspension. [[03:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12953.56s)]
*  But it was so perfect timing because my foot was so fucked up. [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12956.359999999999s)]
*  So it was very beneficial that I couldn't fight. [[03:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12961.199999999999s)]
*  But then, yeah, two years later. [[03:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12963.64s)]
*  But yeah, I was grappling a lot in those two years. [[03:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12966.32s)]
*  Even with my foot fucked up. [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12969.439999999999s)]
*  Did you just not plant on it? [[03:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12970.8s)]
*  It was just painful. [[03:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12973.24s)]
*  It wasn't... [[03:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12974.68s)]
*  It wasn't... [[03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12975.68s)]
*  I don't know if it was just super inflamed all the time. [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12977.08s)]
*  Or if I just didn't... [[03:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12980.92s)]
*  You know what? I think it was a lot of scar tissue. [[03:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12981.92s)]
*  I didn't get it massaged out enough. [[03:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12983.68s)]
*  I didn't get enough manual physical therapy. [[03:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12985.199999999999s)]
*  So I probably just didn't take care of it enough. [[03:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12988.76s)]
*  But I know Liz Frank injuries. [[03:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12990.84s)]
*  I was looking it up and stuff. [[03:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12993.52s)]
*  And they're very serious fucking injuries. [[03:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12994.68s)]
*  Like people can be career enders. [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12996.68s)]
*  I think it happens with football players and shit. [[03:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=12998.92s)]
*  But it can be a serious injury. [[03:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13001.48s)]
*  But I've been super fortunate lately. [[03:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13003.64s)]
*  I've been feeling good. [[03:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13006.08s)]
*  Well, it seems like you're back 100 percent. [[03:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13007.16s)]
*  Like your movements. Excellent. [[03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13008.64s)]
*  I had a labrum, torn labrum in my right hip shortly after that Liz Frank surgery. [[03:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13010.199999999999s)]
*  So I had two surgeries within like a couple of months. [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13015.24s)]
*  Because my debut and then that second fight, I had a torn labrum. [[03:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13019.48s)]
*  And I couldn't fucking... It hurt so bad. [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13023.56s)]
*  Have you ever had a torn labrum in your hip at all? [[03:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13025.199999999999s)]
*  No. [[03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13026.8s)]
*  Just annoying as fuck. [[03:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13027.48s)]
*  And a lot of people have torn labrums, but just small torn or small tears. [[03:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13028.8s)]
*  And then eventually it gets to a point to where it's like a it's an issue. [[03:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13033.52s)]
*  And that's where mine was. [[03:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13036.24s)]
*  So I fought Terry on wear with a torn labrum. [[03:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13037.56s)]
*  And I remember walking around Fight Week in Vegas and I was just fucking... [[03:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13039.92s)]
*  It was the most uncomfortable. [[03:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13043.08s)]
*  Like I had to like hobble back to my hotel room and stretch and just like it was super painful. [[03:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13045.24s)]
*  But I was able right after Liz Frank surgery, shortly after I got the hip surgery, [[03:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13050.88s)]
*  which was not bad at all. [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13055.119999999999s)]
*  Like that's a lot less of a surgery. [[03:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13056.599999999999s)]
*  So but yeah, now I feel fucking great. [[03:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13059.32s)]
*  I would like to get my nose fixed eventually. [[03:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13061.8s)]
*  Justin Gage just did it. [[03:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13066.16s)]
*  Yeah, I heard that your nose is less... [[03:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13067.199999999999s)]
*  It's weaker after you get surgery. [[03:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13069.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13073.88s)]
*  I think the benefits you've been able to breathe out of your nose far surpass the weakness. [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13075.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would agree. [[03:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13080.76s)]
*  It'll help your cardio. [[03:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13081.88s)]
*  I got mine done a while back, like 15 years ago. [[03:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13083.039999999999s)]
*  It's fucking greatest decision I've ever made. [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13086.48s)]
*  I sleep with mouth tape every night. [[03:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13088.519999999999s)]
*  It's probably hard to get air through that nose, right? [[03:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13090.48s)]
*  One time I'm a little congested right now, but even last night at the hotel, [[03:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13093.359999999999s)]
*  I bring my mouth tape, I sleep with it. [[03:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13097.279999999999s)]
*  I have to fucking... [[03:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13100.199999999999s)]
*  I've been sleeping with mouth tape for years now and I just have to, [[03:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13101.279999999999s)]
*  but I have to make sure I have to hit some nose spray sometimes. [[03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13104.08s)]
*  Maybe it's a good time to do it now. [[03:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13107.359999999999s)]
*  Because if... [[03:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13109.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[03:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13110.64s)]
*  I'm so ready to get back to the gym. [[03:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13111.16s)]
*  I'm ready to grind and grapple. [[03:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13114.0s)]
*  I'm pretty much... [[03:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13115.519999999999s)]
*  What are you hoping for? [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13116.4s)]
*  Like if they offer you a title shot, when are you hoping for? [[03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13117.359999999999s)]
*  July? [[03:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13120.48s)]
*  If I had to guess, yeah, it would be July. [[03:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13121.839999999998s)]
*  I just want to go grind and be in the gym and just basically be in Jiu-Jitsu camp, [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13123.359999999999s)]
*  which is going to benefit me in the long run anyway. [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13128.88s)]
*  And that's what I've been doing is grinding on the Jiu-Jitsu anyway, [[03:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13131.56s)]
*  but I want to take it up another level. [[03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13133.88s)]
*  I'm in such a good mind space and a head space to just get back to the grind [[03:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13137.64s)]
*  of grappling and wrestling and it's going to benefit me so much. [[03:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13141.72s)]
*  So the next four or five months, what do we got? [[03:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13145.0s)]
*  December, January, February, March, May, June, July, August. [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13147.72s)]
*  Because it seems like a good fight for that big card that they do. [[03:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13150.119999999999s)]
*  International fighting. [[03:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13153.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13154.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13154.68s)]
*  I'm so curious if Henry and Aljo are going to fight in like March in Vegas. [[03:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13155.32s)]
*  I know that's probably what the UFC... [[03:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13160.52s)]
*  If Henry's coming back, he deserves a title shot, whatever. [[03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13163.48s)]
*  Let those guys fight. [[03:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13165.72s)]
*  Aljo's health, he just beat up TJ. [[03:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13166.68s)]
*  He took no injuries. [[03:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13169.08s)]
*  How much time does Henry need to get ready? [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13171.0s)]
*  Supposedly, Henry's on Twitter saying, let's go, Aljo. [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13174.52s)]
*  He was calling out Perth for February. [[03:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13177.800000000001s)]
*  So I think Henry's ready to go. [[03:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13180.36s)]
*  Aljo, I don't know. [[03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13182.76s)]
*  I don't know if he knows Henry's a tough fight, [[03:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13184.2s)]
*  doesn't want that fight or what. [[03:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13186.28s)]
*  But if I had to guess... [[03:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13188.2s)]
*  It's definitely a tough fight. [[03:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13189.32s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[03:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13190.36s)]
*  Henry's a tough fight for anybody. [[03:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13190.92s)]
*  They fight in March. [[03:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13192.68s)]
*  I fight the winner in July is what I'd like. [[03:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13193.4s)]
*  So... [[03:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13196.359999999999s)]
*  But for me, my next fight's a title fight. [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13198.039999999999s)]
*  So to whoever... [[03:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13199.96s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[03:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13201.16s)]
*  I'm fine with title fights. [[03:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13202.119999999999s)]
*  Shugga Shane! [[03:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13203.16s)]
*  Yeah, Shugga Shane. [[03:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13204.199999999999s)]
*  Every time... [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13205.96s)]
*  I've heard him do like on Instagram or interviews or get ass. [[03:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13206.52s)]
*  Shugga Shane, that's just me for Snoop. [[03:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13209.48s)]
*  But that's fine. [[03:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13211.32s)]
*  It's fucking Snoop. [[03:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13211.88s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[03:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13212.92s)]
*  It's close enough. [[03:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13213.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's hilarious. [[03:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SsCrupNHKA&t=13214.279999999999s)]
