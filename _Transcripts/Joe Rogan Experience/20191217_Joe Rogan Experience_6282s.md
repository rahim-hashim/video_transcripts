# Joe Rogan Experience #1402 - Boyan Slat
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 17, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whRVyywTov4)
*  What's up, fella?
*  How are you?
*  Good to see you again, man.
*  Likewise.
*  I've been reading that you are having some great success with your machine finally.
*  Everything's up and running.
*  Last time we talked, you had yet to implement it, actually out in the wild.
*  And now you explain to us what happened.
*  You had some bumps in the beginning, right?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's been quite a few years.
*  Finally, something's happening.
*  So we launched our first ocean system from San Francisco in September of last year.
*  And we took it out, and roughly two months later, we figured that, first of all, it wasn't
*  catching plastic.
*  So what we saw was that the system was moving at roughly the same speed as the plastic.
*  So maybe just take one step back, the idea and how it works.
*  So of course, we have this great Pacific garbage patch between here and Hawaii, twice the size
*  of Texas, 100 million kilos of plastic doesn't go away by itself.
*  And the idea was to have this artificial coastline that is driven by the forces of the ocean.
*  We put it in there, and the plastic naturally accumulates against it and kind of stays in
*  there so we can then periodically get it out.
*  Because the big challenge is that, although there's a lot of plastic, it's spread out
*  over this vast area.
*  So we first have to concentrate it before we can take it out.
*  Because if you were to simply troll the ocean for plastic with boats and nets, it would
*  just take forever, really.
*  So the idea was to have those artificial coastlines.
*  We deployed the first one, and then what we saw was that somehow the system was moving
*  at the same speed as the plastic.
*  So you can imagine if this is like your Pac-Man, and this is your catch, and it's moving at
*  the same speed.
*  It's not going in, and sometimes it did go in, but it went out again.
*  We got a video of it, what it was doing.
*  That's great, yeah.
*  So this is the basic idea, but it wasn't doing that.
*  And then we thought, okay, that's all right, we'll learn from it, we'll try and adjust
*  the systems.
*  And then literally exactly a year ago, the system broke into two.
*  And so with the structural failure, forcing us to tow the whole thing back to land and
*  go back to the drawing board.
*  So we didn't have the best start of this year.
*  How much time has been lost?
*  Or how much time has been spent, I should say, in the beginning phase, the initial version
*  that you launched versus where you're at now?
*  So we've been going on at this for, since 2013.
*  So after five years, launching it and seeing it break into two, that wasn't the best start
*  of the year I could have imagined.
*  But then, you know, went to the drawing board, and the team really took it well.
*  And we took those lessons into account, adjusted the design and relaunched really just a few
*  months later, so in June.
*  And this time we made the system a bit more modular so we could try different things to
*  try and adjust the speed, make it go faster, make it go slower.
*  And then what we figured was, well, the system isn't going fast enough.
*  What if we actually turn the problem into a solution?
*  What if we turn it around and actually slow it down so that it goes slower than the plastic?
*  And then what we figured, that actually works.
*  And in October, we announced that we're actually catching plastic.
*  And really just last week, the first two shipping containers full of plastic were landed in
*  port.
*  Wow.
*  So it's really recently up and running the way you expected it.
*  Now, how long does it take to accumulate two shipping containers full?
*  Oh, so that was roughly a month, month and a half.
*  And how big are these shipping containers?
*  Twenty foot, so 42 of these rooms.
*  So the only thing that's really stopping it from getting more is like the actual size
*  of the net itself.
*  Yes, so that's the next step.
*  So now that we went from zero to one, we have the basic principle of catching plastic confirmed.
*  We now have to make it bigger before we can build a whole fleet of them because we reckon
*  we need maybe 50 or 100 of them to really clean up half this patch in five years.
*  That's the objective.
*  Half the whole patch in five years.
*  That's the real objective?
*  Wow.
*  Is that really possible?
*  If you have enough systems.
*  That's incredible.
*  Now, where are you at in terms of like trying to get these systems made and implemented?
*  So now we just finished this first step with the system number one.
*  That's how we called it.
*  And the next step is to develop a system two, which is indeed going to be a bigger version.
*  And the idea is to minimize the amount of vessel use that you need for it.
*  So that comes to, because boats are really fucking expensive.
*  The boat that we have costs roughly 15,000 euros per day to keep running.
*  Wow.
*  Just one boat.
*  So you don't want boats too.
*  Do you anticipate that it ever gets to a point where the amount of money that you can generate
*  from the actual resource of physical plastic can actually pay for the whole experiment?
*  In hope so.
*  That's what we want to try next year by making products from the catch that we make.
*  The material itself hardly has any value.
*  It's really the story to it.
*  You should make straws so people don't feel guilty.
*  It's a recycled straw.
*  Yeah.
*  Throw them in the ocean again.
*  Yeah, that's a terrible idea.
*  But what would it be?
*  A very sustainable business model.
*  Yeah, just keep going.
*  What are the products that you're thinking about?
*  We have a few ideas.
*  It's still kind of under development.
*  So I think in September we should be ready to launch the first one.
*  But I think it's going to be things that are durable, that don't end up in ways that will
*  retain their value, so can last for a very, very long time.
*  And that you actually want and ideally carry around so you can talk about it with other
*  people.
*  Actually, just last week with that first Plastic on Shore, we said, okay, now we welcome our
*  supporters to actually make, well, I shouldn't call it a reservation, but kind of make a
*  down payment so that you can be first in line.
*  So if people go to our website, they can actually put in the 50 bucks and get the right for
*  the first ever products made from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
*  So you're just trying to figure out what products will have the most sustainability, what products
*  people will keep for the longest.
*  Yeah, and things that people want, right?
*  You don't want some kind of gimmick that's just going to be this paperweight.
*  Flip-flops seem like an easy one, right?
*  Don't they?
*  I mean, people love to buy flip-flops if they bought flip-flops.
*  Especially people that are like sort of like outdoorsy type folks.
*  Sure.
*  Appreciate the beach.
*  And maybe have to write these things down.
*  Flip-flops?
*  That's a pretty easy one.
*  Any other ideas?
*  What else, Jamie?
*  What else would be a good one?
*  Belts.
*  All shoes.
*  Any flip-flops.
*  All shoes.
*  Shoes.
*  Definitely some Yeezys.
*  Some dope recycled.
*  Yeah, some recycled sneakers.
*  What is foam?
*  The foam that they make running shoes out of.
*  That's a very specific type of...
*  That's not actual plastic, right?
*  It's probably made out of something else.
*  It's a type of plastic.
*  We might be able to foam this material as well.
*  I think we've done tests with that.
*  Oh, really?
*  Turn it into foam?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, through some sort of process.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you could make athletic shoes.
*  Yeah.
*  People.
*  But you'd have to have a way to incentivize people to recycle them.
*  It would be so ironic for those fucking things to wind up back in the ocean.
*  There's got to be a way to do that.
*  If you have your own company drop-off points in cities where when they're done with their
*  stuff, if it's broken down or it's old, you could throw it into this bin and you will
*  ensure that it gets converted back into raw materials and utilized again.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Circular economy.
*  Yeah.
*  That'd be a great move.
*  People would do that if you made it easy for them.
*  It's sort of like recycling bins.
*  If you make it easy for them, they'll throw their bottle in there.
*  You have these two cargo ships or these two cargo containers filled with this plastic
*  stuff.
*  What do you do with it now?
*  Yeah.
*  So now it's going to Europe.
*  Unfortunately, there isn't really any useful recycling infrastructure in the US.
*  So we set up this infrastructure in Europe to be able to first sort it and then shred
*  it and then recycle it and then make those first products out of them.
*  And hopefully with that then generate the cash needed to continue running the cleanup.
*  Of course, now it's still small scale.
*  Eventually we should have those number of shipping containers every day probably.
*  So do you have a group of people that's trying to come up with ideas of what to make out
*  of the plastic?
*  Yeah.
*  It's a little team inside the Arctic Cleanup working on that.
*  And yeah.
*  So they said that by September they should be ready to launch the first product.
*  That's great, man.
*  The whole idea behind it is beautiful.
*  You have a river system too as well, right?
*  Yes.
*  So that's the other thing, right?
*  So on one hand we need to clean up what's running in the ocean.
*  It doesn't go away by itself.
*  And basically the only way to deal with that is to just go out there and clean it up.
*  But of course then there's this other side of the equation which is there's still huge,
*  huge amounts of plastic flowing into the ocean every day, mostly from countries in Central
*  America, South East Asia, where people are kind of at this stage of development or countries
*  are at a stage of development where the people are wealthy enough to consume a lot of things
*  that are wrapped in plastic, yet there isn't any waste infrastructure yet to take care
*  of it.
*  So you literally see people on scooters just drive to a bridge to dump their municipal
*  waste into the river because that's simply the easiest way to get rid of it, to your
*  point.
*  What's easiest people will do.
*  And so it's not really that people don't care there or that they are less civilized or something,
*  but it's really a combination.
*  There's a lot of people and there is no infrastructure that they can make use of.
*  So then back in 2015 we were like, okay, maybe at some point in time this ocean thing will
*  work out.
*  Who knows?
*  But then we're stuck with this problem that there's still so much plastic flowing in that
*  we would just have to keep going forever.
*  That would just be not very motivating and we want to be this project with a beginning
*  and an end.
*  So we're like, okay, so where's the plastic coming from?
*  And then we figured, you know, it's probably rivers.
*  Rivers are like these arteries that carry the trash from land to sea because when it
*  rains plastic washes from street to creek to river to ocean.
*  But then we found out that there is a hundred thousand rivers in the world.
*  So that's kind of a big amount if you want to do something about it.
*  So we started doing measurements in rivers and then what we found was that just 1% of
*  rivers are responsible for 80% of the pollution.
*  So really just a very tiny amount of rivers, if you were to tackle those, could really
*  address the majority of the plastic going into the ocean.
*  And it's mostly like these relatively small rivers in capital cities like Manila, like
*  Jakarta, like Kuala Lumpur.
*  We have very high density of people near the coast.
*  That's where most of the leakage, most of the emissions occurs.
*  So since 2015, we've been kind of as a secret site project, been working on seeing, well,
*  can we actually develop something to intercept the plastic in those rivers?
*  We just launched it a month ago.
*  We call it the Interceptor.
*  And it's this scalable system that's almost like plug and play.
*  So you bring it to a river and you install it and it just works.
*  It's fully autonomous, solar powered.
*  So this is all real, the real plastic that's being pulled out of this river from your machine.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is incredible.
*  This was the prototype.
*  Dude, that's amazing.
*  This was in Jakarta.
*  For people that are just listening, we're looking at this thing pull enormous amounts
*  of plastic out of this river.
*  And it's also doing so in there, stacking it into these bags.
*  It's a large physical quantity of stuff.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And then maybe you can actually pull up the video of Interceptor 2 in Malaysia.
*  So we already have two of them in real life as we speak.
*  How does it avoid doing anything with fish?
*  How do you avoid catch accidentally?
*  Oh my God, is that real?
*  Yeah.
*  So this is the Klang River in Kuala Lumpur.
*  And according to our model, it's like the fifth most polluting river in the world.
*  So 1% of all plastic going into the world's oceans is coming from that one river.
*  And this is unbelievable how polluted this is.
*  This is crazy.
*  It's 10 million kilos per year, roughly.
*  Just looking at it, it looks like a wasteland.
*  That's so sad.
*  Yeah.
*  So we now have four Interceptors.
*  Two of them have already been deployed.
*  So here's the one going to this Klang River.
*  And kind of wanted to make it look like a spaceship, just so people would like it.
*  And so it has this barrier that concentrates the plastic to the mouth of the Interceptor,
*  where you have a conveyor belt that then scoops it out of the water.
*  Again, fully solar and battery powered.
*  And then deposits it on to this moving shuttle conveyor, which then distributes it
*  across these big dumpsters.
*  Can hold roughly 50 cubic meters of trash.
*  And yeah, it just works by itself.
*  So that's what it does.
*  That's an insane amount of garbage that you're pulling out of there.
*  When you look at it visually, folks, you can watch the video.
*  What is the name of this video, Jamie?
*  Some people need to find it.
*  Rivers Interceptor 002 Cleaning in Malaysia is the title of the YouTube video.
*  It's crazy.
*  Now, and you're not catching any fish in this?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So because this barrier is non-permeable, the current just flows underneath it.
*  Basically, the sea life can just pass it.
*  Actually, at one point we had this giant lizard, which was probably two meters.
*  We should post that photo.
*  It was kind of climbing onto the barrier and then it just swam around it.
*  Two meters, really?
*  Yeah, one and a half.
*  What kind of lizard is that?
*  I don't know the name, but it was...
*  Some kind of monitor or something?
*  Monitor, that's...
*  Yeah.
*  You're right.
*  Where is that?
*  You see an image of that?
*  No?
*  I'll post that next week.
*  Oh, you haven't posted it before?
*  Oh, okay.
*  He was looking for it.
*  I thought you were saying it was out there.
*  So it's safe for fish.
*  What about the stuff that doesn't float on the very surface?
*  Right.
*  So the system goes down one meter.
*  What we measured is that really almost all the plastic is in that top layer.
*  So sure, it won't be 100% efficient, but I think it's really about having this pragmatic
*  thing that catches most of it.
*  And most importantly, leaves wildlife alone because everything else can just swim underneath that.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, that's great.
*  And so this plan that you had when it's been six years running, how much of your daily time
*  is devoted to this?
*  Oh, I don't think there's much free time at all.
*  Especially past year, I've not had a single free day.
*  Not a single?
*  Yeah, just 9 a.m. to usually 9 p.m. in the office.
*  It's been busy, but I think it was worth it.
*  Now looking where we were at the beginning of the year to where we're now.
*  Well, now that you've actually pulled these cargo containers filled with plastic out of
*  the ocean, that must give you an extreme feeling of satisfaction, right?
*  That you've actually made it work.
*  It's moving now.
*  So I was kind of hoping for that feeling, but then when you get to that point, you're like,
*  okay, but there's still, you can really only see the amount of work that's still ahead of you.
*  So it's actually really hard to enjoy successes in a way.
*  I should probably get better at that.
*  It's hard.
*  Well, particularly what you're doing, you have a monumental task in front of you.
*  And what you're doing is rightly being applauded by so many people, but I don't know how many
*  people are actually helping you.
*  You have a crazy thing that you're doing.
*  You're trying to pull the plastic out of the ocean.
*  When people find out about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, they get panicky.
*  They're like, what?
*  How long has this been going on?
*  How do I not know about this?
*  Because so few people, I mean, I would think like maybe 40% of the population understands
*  that there's a gigantic patch of garbage in the middle of the ocean.
*  And it was discovered 20 years ago.
*  Exactly 20 years ago.
*  And still it's there, just been growing.
*  So 1998, no one had a goddamn clue.
*  No.
*  And then they went, hey, what's going on here?
*  What is all this garbage?
*  And it keeps getting bigger and bigger, right?
*  Yeah, it's actually quite a good story.
*  This is the sailor called Charles Moore who was participating in a sail race between
*  Hawaii and California.
*  And while others would go further north, he thought, well, let's try and cut off this
*  piece.
*  And then he was looking at the water and he just saw all that trash.
*  And then he went back.
*  He was shocked about it.
*  And then he decided to take some measurements, publish the results.
*  And that kind of popularized that whole concept of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
*  It's a weird thing to see when you see drones flying over it and you see the footage of
*  it.
*  And it's also a lot of it is a lot smaller than people think of it because it's broken
*  down by the ocean, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So that's what happens over time is that these larger objects, how basically it enters the
*  ocean due to the working of the waves as well as the sun breaks down to these smaller and
*  smaller pieces, which is actually not really a good thing because these smaller pieces
*  are easier to ingest for fish and other wildlife.
*  So the smaller it gets in a way, the more harmful it gets as well.
*  And fortunately, what we see is that still 92% of the plastic is still non-microplastic,
*  so big stuff.
*  But of course, if we don't clean it up over the next few decades, all of that big stuff
*  will also become microplastics and then we're in a much worse state.
*  Is the cleanup of those microplastics possible or is it just something that needs to be sort
*  of rethought out?
*  Well, so that was actually one of the positive surprises that we had this year is that the
*  cleanup system in the patch wasn't just catching plastic, not just the big stuff, it was also
*  catching most of the microplastics.
*  So down to one millimeter.
*  So it's clogged up with all the other stuff, is that what it is?
*  We're not exactly sure how it was able to do that, but we just saw huge amounts of those
*  microplastics in the system.
*  It probably has to do something with the radiation of the waves, so you have that big pipe that
*  keeps the system together.
*  Because waves are kind of crashing against it, it reflects waves as well and almost like
*  a lens, it was concentrating those microplastics into one patch in the middle of the system,
*  which was kind of this holding on into the system.
*  So that was really, we weren't expecting to collect microplastics, but there we were.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  So now where are you at in terms of trying to expand it to a point where you could really
*  get this goal of half of the plastic or the ocean in five years?
*  Yeah, so it would probably be easier if we had one goal, but we now set two goals for
*  ourselves.
*  One is the 50% in five years for the patch, but the other one is that we want to have
*  interceptors into the 1000 most polluting rivers, the ones that do the 80% in the next
*  five years.
*  So we'll be pretty busy.
*  Really, really busy.
*  So if you're not busy enough.
*  Yeah.
*  How many people are working in your organization?
*  About a hundred.
*  And I think really team has been now better than it's ever been.
*  So fortunately, there's definitely a lot of help, but we're still recruiting quite,
*  I think, not 20, 30 people coming off here.
*  So definitely there is a lot of work to do.
*  What has this ride been like for you from being this like really young guy when you
*  figured this out?
*  Like how old were you when you came up with the idea?
*  The first idea is when I was 16, but really founded the organization when I was 18.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's really young.
*  18 to where you are now, just being constantly involved in this process.
*  What has that been like for you?
*  Educational, I would say.
*  So really when I started and when I look back at when I started, I really didn't have a
*  bloody clue what I was doing.
*  And I suppose that was a good thing because if I would have known how complicated and
*  big it would have to become in order to actually take some plastic out of the ocean,
*  I probably wouldn't have started it.
*  It was just too big.
*  And I remember giving my first presentation back in 2012 and somebody approached me and
*  he said, okay, great idea.
*  It's going to cost like tens of millions of dollars.
*  You're going to need a team of maybe 100 people to get this to a point that it could
*  actually work.
*  And I thought this guy was crazy.
*  No way.
*  So that's why I started a $2 million crowdfunding campaign to get it started.
*  And yeah, he was closer to the truth than I could have ever imagined.
*  When you think about the amount of time that you're investing in this, how do you see
*  yourself ever getting off this ride?
*  Does this what you want to do for the rest of your life?
*  No.
*  So I simply want to solve problems.
*  And I think this is kind of a good starter problem.
*  I think it's very feasible to actually solve it.
*  It's by the way hilarious that you're talking about the Great Pacific garbage patch as a
*  starter problem.
*  Oh, well.
*  What kind of ambition do you have?
*  That's one of the most perplexing problems with garbage and waste today.
*  Yeah, but I do think it's solvable.
*  And I think it is too, according to you and what you're saying.
*  But to call it a starter problem is hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, I think this was the exciting thing for me is that I picked this problem
*  as the first one because I believed it would not just be solvable, it's solvable by a
*  relatively small group of passionate people.
*  And yeah, so of course, what I hope is that with the OceanCleaner, we can kind of create
*  this blueprint of how you solve a problem and how you make civilization a bit more
*  sustainable so that hopefully with that blueprint, we can not only solve more other problems in the
*  future, but also inspire others to do the same thing.
*  Well, that's a beautiful sentiment.
*  And do you have any other things that you want to try to solve once you've sort of
*  stepped away from this?
*  Yeah.
*  So I really, there's definitely not going to be a shortage of ideas.
*  So I keep this little booklet that's kind of overflowing.
*  But what I realized is to be successful with the cleanup, I really need razor sharp focus
*  and I can only do one thing at the same time.
*  And like ideas are like viruses.
*  And when they enter your mind, it kind of expands and evolves.
*  And it's really quite dangerous actually to have new ideas.
*  There was, I forgot who said that, but somebody recently I heard saying,
*  the best thing you can do is having one great idea than never having any other ideas in the
*  rest of your life.
*  So just because to be...
*  Your resources.
*  Right.
*  To achieve something, you need full focus.
*  I think it was Stewart Brand, by the way.
*  It's a good thing to say.
*  It's accurate.
*  What do you think though about what I was going to get at was, do you ever conceive
*  of a possibility of coming up with something that removes carbon from the atmosphere?
*  That's a giant issue with us, right?
*  Right.
*  Carbon emissions.
*  So definitely, I believe negative emissions, I think you refer to them,
*  will be required to make the goals to kind of keep the warming in check.
*  However, it's a much more difficult problem because if you think of the ocean, it's basically
*  a two-dimensional problem.
*  It's a plastic on the surface.
*  And fortunately, it's not even the whole ocean.
*  It's kind of concentrating in these accumulation zones.
*  So the garbage patch, although it's twice the size of Texas, it's still
*  1.6 million square kilometers, while the ocean is like 300 million square kilometers.
*  It's really just maybe less than a percent of the ocean which needs to be cleaned.
*  And again, it's a two-dimensional problem.
*  Well, the atmosphere is three-dimensional.
*  So it's just this one-dimensional increase is just a huge, huge challenge.
*  So I do think it needs to be tackled.
*  It's definitely an exciting problem to think about.
*  I do think that's definitely not a good starter problem to work on.
*  Wasn't there something, Jamie, that we had talked about where they had figured out a
*  way to make these building-sized essentially vacuum cleaners they were going to put in
*  the center of certain cities?
*  I believe it was in Asia.
*  Maybe perhaps China.
*  They'd come up with this.
*  I don't know if they implemented it yet, but the idea was to have these enormous things
*  in place that look like a skyscraper.
*  And really, it was just a huge vacuum cleaner for carbon.
*  Sure.
*  I know of a few companies that work with carbon engineering.
*  There's also one out of Switzerland.
*  I forgot the name.
*  But definitely good, smart people are working on that problem.
*  I'm not sure where they are in terms of the economics and scalability.
*  Is it right here?
*  When you mentioned it's garbage engineering, it's this one.
*  Okay.
*  So that looks like giant fans, like a huge building filled with fans.
*  We believe humanity can solve climate change.
*  Yikes.
*  Imagine we have filters for air the same way we have filters for water.
*  Direct air capture technology.
*  Carbon engineering.
*  More than 10 years in the making, it can capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere.
*  And look at that machine.
*  Try to get a close-up on what that thing looks like.
*  It looks like giant fucking washing machines.
*  It's washing the air.
*  Doesn't it look like giant washing machines?
*  Wow.
*  It seems like it's feasible.
*  It doesn't seem like it's something that's impossible.
*  I think it's the scalability that's the main challenge.
*  Well, it's also funding.
*  If you drive over or fly over Manhattan, rather, and see the density of the structures and
*  how many buildings are in there, you know that people can make some pretty insane shit.
*  Why couldn't they make some giant insane vacuum cleaner for the air that's as big as a city block?
*  Of course, a lot of it comes down to economics.
*  Our system is not very good at valuing things that are long-term or directly benefit ourselves.
*  So definitely.
*  People tax it.
*  We'll find a way to make it profitable.
*  Is this another one?
*  Rendering of what one would look like to capture one million tons of CO2 per year.
*  Whoa.
*  Sounds like it looks like it'd be noisy.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Probably annoying as fuck.
*  Look at those fans.
*  That's so weird, though.
*  The whole array of fans.
*  That seems like a way to do it.
*  Looks like somebody built a giant computer and tried to cool it or something.
*  And then they'll have all this carbon.
*  What the fuck do they do with that?
*  Burn it?
*  What do they do?
*  I don't know.
*  What do you make shit out of it?
*  What do you do?
*  Make diamonds?
*  Imagine that.
*  Diamonds are a girl's best friend.
*  You make it out of the carbon that you pull out of the air.
*  Be a good business model.
*  That would be a great business model.
*  This would be like a green diamond.
*  A diamond that's actually made and it's all pressured by solar power.
*  They use solar power to fucking smash it.
*  Carbon-free.
*  Is that the same carbon fiber?
*  I don't know.
*  Is it the same shit?
*  Yeah, why not?
*  Right?
*  Must be.
*  It's carbon.
*  So carbon is how they make...
*  It's coal, right?
*  Which is essentially carbon.
*  Do they make diamonds from carbon or they make diamonds just from coal?
*  What is coal?
*  Coal's like burnt shit, right?
*  There's many, many forms in which carbon exists.
*  I know they are.
*  Different crystal structures.
*  They are doing that now where they are making commercially made diamonds.
*  Diamonds are made of carbon.
*  So they form as carbon atoms under a high temperature and pressure.
*  They bond together to start growing crystals.
*  That's why a diamond is such a hard material because you have each carbon atom participating
*  in four of these very strong covalent bonds that form between carbon atoms.
*  I've never read that word out loud.
*  Covalent?
*  Have you ever read that word out loud?
*  Covalent, I believe.
*  Is that how you say it?
*  I've never even seen that word.
*  So these bonds that form between carbon atoms.
*  So I know they are doing that now.
*  They are making diamonds with certain machines.
*  High pressure, high X.
*  Yeah.
*  If they did, that would be hilarious.
*  That would be a good thing too because they would put a dent in the actual diamond market,
*  which is this weird lockdown fucking strange market.
*  Because diamonds aren't nearly as valuable as they are set out to be.
*  De Beers takes these diamonds and they stockpile them.
*  They only release a certain amount of them and they keep the price very high.
*  But it's all engineered.
*  Diamonds used to be far more rare than they are now.
*  But with the innovation in mining technology and their ability to get to diamonds they couldn't
*  get to before, they have a lot of diamonds.
*  It's not as valuable as it appears when you go to buy one.
*  So we can make carbon diamonds, bro.
*  And actually, plastic, again, is just carbon chains.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  We can even make diamonds out of Ocean Plus.
*  Whoa, that would be the ultimate green diamond.
*  Imagine if you were a really ecologically minded rapper.
*  You could wear all your ice, could come from the ocean, let everybody know.
*  From trash to treasure.
*  Yes.
*  Dude, that's the fucking, that's the signature of the company.
*  In quotes, from trash to treasure.
*  You're trying to write these things down.
*  Boy and diamonds, how about that?
*  I like it.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, you could be the first guy to do this.
*  Here we go.
*  Plastic, this is an ocean diamond.
*  Whoa.
*  Earth is crushing the ocean into salty diamonds.
*  That's a dope looking diamond too.
*  What is that?
*  Is it salt, I guess?
*  Recreated salty diamond deposits in a high pressure, high temperature experiment suggesting
*  that many of Earth's diamonds form when the mantle crushes ancient seabed minerals.
*  Oh, isn't science and the Earth cool?
*  I mean, if you do get to do this, here's another problem.
*  Okay.
*  Here's a big one for the ocean.
*  We're depleting it of seafood, of life.
*  I mean, I had, how do you say his name again?
*  Sahoyas, right?
*  Luis Sahoyas, who directed The Covon.
*  Yeah.
*  We were talking about the deplenishing of the wildlife in the ocean.
*  When you start looking at it on a grand scale, how much fish they're pulling out of the oceans,
*  it's very sobering.
*  Maybe you can come up with a way to replenish fish in the ocean so we can continue eating sushi.
*  So maybe just zoom out a bit.
*  Because of course, plastic pollution, climate change, overfishing,
*  I think it's all part of one big problem to make civilization sustainable.
*  The way I look at it is that, of course, over the past 200 years,
*  humanity has made tremendous progress.
*  So of course, since agriculture revolution 10,000 years ago,
*  humanity has been kind of stagnant, no progress, or just very, very slow progress,
*  number of people, lifespan, it was all kind of flat, nothing really happened.
*  And then since the dawn of the industrial revolution,
*  when we learned how to utilize science and our knowledge, collective knowledge,
*  to turn that into progress, basically every possible metric for humanity has
*  improved tremendously.
*  If you think of wealth, health, violence, education, rights, all these things,
*  I know you've had Stephen Pinker on, he's much more knowledgeable on that topic than I am.
*  Yet, so truly, at this point in time, it has never been a better time to be alive for humans than
*  today.
*  Not saying that it can't get better, but we have made tremendous progress.
*  By one hand, imagining things that don't exist yet, so inventing technologies and also
*  inventing institutions.
*  And on the other hand, our human ability to collaborate effectively in large numbers,
*  which includes the corporation, which is a very effective way for people to work together.
*  Now, all that progress has also had its negative side effects, which are most pronounced, of
*  course, in the area of the environment, where we put things into an environment that shouldn't
*  belong there, and we take too much out of it, then nature can replenish, which includes the fish,
*  and on the other hand, we have the plastic going into the environment, etc.
*  Then the question is, well, how do we solve that?
*  And of course, one hand is to say, okay, it's kind of the, maybe the luditis is maybe a bit of a
*  negative way to phrase it, but the sort of reactionary approach of saying, okay, we should
*  consume less, corporations are bad, technology is bad, we should all get rid of all those things,
*  and I think the modern environmental movement, which is very kind of this romantic movement,
*  has this image of back in the day, everything was great, we lived in harmony with nature,
*  so let's get rid of all this modernity and try and return to that pure original state.
*  What I, however, believe is that, first of all, that's, I don't think it's a very realistic thing,
*  people want to keep their iPhones and their cars, and people want to move forward,
*  and at the same time, I don't think it's really the most effective way to solve these problems,
*  because it would be like fighting a leopard tank with bow and arrow, technology is nothing more
*  than an enabler of human capabilities, it enhances our power, so why not use that power to also try
*  and solve these problems as well. So rather than try and reject business, reject technology, I truly
*  believe that we should embrace those forces that make us human, and has created this amazing world
*  to also try and solve these negative side effects as well, and that's why I believe
*  the over consumption of fish is not going to end by people all becoming vegan, but rather through
*  fake meat, I think that the transport emissions are not going to be solved by people not flying
*  anymore, or not going anywhere anymore, realistically people are going to fly more, so we better invent
*  technologies that allow people to do that without harming the environment, and the same thing
*  I think would be the case for plastic and really other energy uses as well.
*  No, I think that's a very wise way of looking at it, and it's a hopeful way of looking at it,
*  and it's funny that today, even though you're dealing with statistics and factual information,
*  like the fact that it is safer to live today, there's less violent crime, it's easier to get
*  by this more technology, more innovation, medical technologies improve radically, all these things
*  are true, but you still have to say it's not where we want it to be. I'm not saying that the world's
*  part, you have to say that, even you, like even though you're, I mean, like it's the worry about
*  people barking at you, so worry about people, it's still terrible in parts of the world, it's
*  still terrible for people of color, it's still terrible for trans, it's still, I get it, I get it,
*  no one's saying that there's not room for improvement, but you have to say that,
*  like you, even though you felt compelled, you're like, it's still not perfect.
*  Yeah, and I wonder why it's so controversial. I think it's important to
*  learn from the things that we do well, and then apply that.
*  I don't think it is that controversial, I think it's a trick. I think there's just a lot of people
*  looking for every single opportunity to complain, even to someone like you, who has objectively
*  done nothing but good. You say one thing, like, I mean, Steven Pinker took a ton of heat for
*  saying that, and even though he's talking about actual scientific statistics, he's just, he's not
*  saying the world's perfect and everyone should shut up, what he's saying is we should look at this,
*  you know, from a bird's eye view, look down and understand that although there's much work to be
*  done, we're in a great place in comparison to the rest of human history. And it's hopeful to realize
*  that progress is possible, just imagine that every, there's something that feels intuitively
*  right, as if every step forward would also have to equal a step backward elsewhere. And I don't
*  think that's the case, there's plenty of things that you can invent that are not that, and we see
*  it, for example, with carbon right now, that there's countries where, you know, like Sweden,
*  GDP has grown a lot past 20 years, carbon emissions has gone down. So they call that the
*  decoupling. And I think what's really the main challenge in this century is to, you know,
*  decouple human progress from those negative side effects. I think the way to do that is not
*  reactionary, it's really, again, through innovation and through collaboration.
*  I agree with you. And I think that a lot of times people just assume that this is these are the
*  consequences of innovation, there's a pro and a con to everything, because there has been so many
*  things, there have been so many things that are inventions that were there are pro and a con,
*  but that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be that way.
*  No, and even if things have a pro and a con, it doesn't mean the pro is as big as the con.
*  So, and if that would be the case, all the technology, every technology would be neutral,
*  and it wouldn't matter what you invent. But it would mean that an atomic bomb is morally
*  as neutral as an ocean cleanup system, which I just don't find plausible. So I do believe that
*  inventors, entrepreneurs, they put certain morality into their creations, into their
*  technology. There is a certain use that you prescribe with your invention. I mean, you don't
*  use nuclear bombs to wash your car, right? I mean, you use it not for benign uses, unless maybe you
*  want to terraform Mars, which some people propose to do with atomic bombs. I don't know if that's a
*  good idea. But yeah, I don't think technology is neutral. It has a morality. So what that means is
*  that as long as we consistently develop net positive technologies, eventually the world does
*  get better and better if say a technology is 60% good and maybe has 40% downside. And okay, but then
*  we can invent a solution for that 40%. And maybe that's again, net positive and you can get this
*  cascade of ever improving what? No, I think what you're saying sounds beautiful. And if more people
*  thought the way you're thinking, I think the world would be a better place. I like the positivity.
*  I like the optimism and what you're thinking in terms, particularly in terms of what's possible
*  with innovation. Yeah, well, I just don't think that being against something is very productive.
*  It doesn't really move us forward. So rather than protesting against the things that I don't agree
*  with, and there's certainly things that I don't agree with. But again, I don't think it's very
*  helpful. Rather than doing that, I'd much rather build towards the future that I do agree with.
*  Listen, man, I think what you're saying is very, very logical. I wish more people thought like you.
*  You're a great role model for a lot of kids to use your energy in a positive direction.
*  It can be done. Yeah, sure. I mean, I think we agree with your turn.
*  Do you think that, I mean, when you're looking at this possibility of getting 50% of the ocean's
*  garbage out in five years, do you think that's realistic in terms of the resources that you have,
*  the funding that you have and all that stuff? And if not, how can people help? Do you have a website
*  where people can... Yeah, so definitely, we don't yet have both... We don't have the technology ready
*  to really clean up the patch. The reverse is a different story. We're really ready to scale.
*  But on the ocean, we still need some iteration. And of course, the funding isn't there yet. So of
*  course, on our website, theoceancleanup.com, people can donate, people can also... Okay, cool. There it
*  goes. Support the cleanup. Yeah. And so you have... Is it like PayPal or what is it? Yeah, anything you
*  want. And you can join the queue for the products that... That's excellent. Beautiful. And so,
*  are you getting a lot of success with that? People are contributing? So definitely so far has been
*  enough to keep the development going. So it hasn't really been the limiting factor. But of course,
*  if we want to scale, we're going to need a lot more resources. So definitely a lot of help will be
*  required there in the coming years. It's amazing that this is taking you so long and that you've
*  been working on it so hard that you have all this energy to be able to pursue something like this.
*  I mean, was there ever a time while you're doing this, you'll be like, Jesus Christ, I don't know
*  how long I'm going to be able to do this. Is it sustainable like this every day? No days off?
*  Constant? Yeah. So probably I should take a few days off. Hell yeah. Yeah. This year has been tough.
*  Do you feel guilty if you take time off? Yeah. So usually I feel that with a lot of my... That's
*  probably the case for everyone, that a lot of my strengths are at the same time also my weaknesses.
*  So I think I'm pretty creative, so it's good. But at the same time, it means that I really have to
*  force myself to not be distracted by new ideas. I think I have a good work ethic, but the downside
*  is that it's also very hard to slow down. And I do realize that taking breaks, it is... Eventually,
*  it is better. The best ideas that I've had were during times off, really. Even the Osher Cleanup
*  idea was I was 16, was scuba diving in Greece, some more plastic than fish. That was during a
*  break. So I should probably take a few days. Yeah, man. Just go somewhere where you could just
*  take a few naps, just relax, recharge, get your system back online perfectly. Yeah. Though I
*  think one side note to make is that with everything that I've ever done in my life,
*  I've always been very obsessed about it. And I think when it's something that you cannot really
*  stop thinking about it, it never really feels like work either. So it's... A calling? Well,
*  yeah. I just wouldn't be able to imagine just having a normal job doing something you're not
*  passionate about. So I never really... How miserable would it be to just be in an office and
*  have to stare at the clock waiting for 6 PM until you can go home? Right. That must be... That's
*  like my biggest nightmare. For a lot of people, that's their life. Yeah. Well, yeah. I don't mean
*  to offend anyone here, but... Look at you, being nice again. Curring your times.
*  No, I agree with you. I understand exactly what you're saying. And if people don't realize that
*  the biggest asset they have in their life is their time, and to spend that wisely, you have this
*  80,000 hours of which I believe is like 40 years, 40 hours a week. Turns out that's 80,000 hours
*  that you can use for anything. And I do believe that people often have a lot more potential than
*  what they turn out to be doing if they were to realize how valuable that time is. And the
*  classic model also for more wealthy people is to work very hard and then to
*  donate here and there. But probably you could be a lot more effective if you were to just
*  use your brain, use your time directly on working something that matters. Well,
*  I think what you just said is legitimate inspiration talk. There's a lot of people that...
*  Should I write a book?
*  You should. Well, just a video I think is good enough. Just a video of you explaining
*  your philosophy. You have accomplished so much and your idea that you're doing is so noble and
*  actually effective. There's something that people need to hear sometimes about
*  different people's philosophies on how to spend their time and their energy.
*  Your perception of instead of wasting it on other things, just concentrate on something that you
*  think is going to make an impact, something that you're drawn to, something that... And yeah,
*  when you do that, then you have a cause and you have a thing that you're working towards.
*  It's not just simply showing up and doing something that someone's paying you to do that
*  you don't necessarily want to do, which is a trap. A lot of people find themselves in that trap and
*  they need to hear people like you talk sometimes. That's as inspirational as anyone who's like a
*  professional, inspirational or motivational speaker for a lot of folks. Maybe more so because
*  you're actually doing something. Yeah. Well, probably my words carry more credibility once
*  the oceans are actually clean. Yeah, it'll help. But just the fact you got two cargo holds filled
*  with two cargo containers. I mean, who the fuck has that? No one. A couple of people have some bags.
*  Yeah. And on the rivers, we have that amount every day now.
*  Really? Every day on the rivers. Wow. When you see that horrible pollution
*  drifting down river, when you see that stuff, does that feel almost like impossible to capture
*  all of it or pointless because people keep throwing it in there? Well, of course, that's the thing. So
*  we don't position these interceptors as being the ultimate solution for the whole process.
*  Of course, eventually you have to make sure plastic doesn't end up in the ocean or in the rivers in
*  the first place. But I was standing, so a few weeks ago I was in Indonesia, Malaysia to see
*  the machines and talk with government people there. And I was standing on the interceptor and
*  you see this constant literally torrent of plastic going into the interceptor. And
*  I was looking upstream and I realized, well, there's more than five million people living
*  in the catchment area of this river. And they have limited infrastructure. They consume so much. And
*  just trying to imagine all that plastic not ending up in the river with such a diffuse source,
*  five million people, was just so hard to imagine. And of course, that's where we have to go to. But
*  realistically speaking, it's just going to take a while. It's going to take maybe
*  two decades, three decades, something like that. So I think rather than staring at the perfect solution
*  and really just working on that, which of course is very important, I think we also need to
*  be a bit more pragmatic and also realize, well, it may take 20, 30 years. Let's at least make sure
*  that during those 20, 30 years, we don't have 10 million kilos of plastic flowing out of this river
*  into the ocean. So you'd have to have some sort of cooperation with the people that are doing that
*  and chucking that plastic into the river. So how do you? So you've got to figure out a way to get
*  to them. So I do hope that the interceptors can have a positive influence upstream as well.
*  Or people say, good, I don't have to worry about it. They've got a thing now. Yeah. It's the best
*  place to throw your plastic because they've got a thing that scoops it out. Guilt-free dumping.
*  Yeah. No. That hazard is called the, or that risk is called moral hazard. It's a phrase from economics
*  wherein the insurance industry is kind of a thing where people make more damage once they're insured
*  because they're less worried. I don't buy it that much as an argument for the plastic problem
*  because it's not like it's a conscious cost-benefit analysis whether you're going to throw something
*  on the street or not. It's more of an unconscious thing. You just do it, right? Or at least,
*  but some people do. And then it's with that same logic why maybe municipalities should also stop
*  sweeping the streets and maybe we shouldn't even collect garbage at people's houses because it
*  only incentivizes the creation of garbage. So I don't think that it's such a-
*  You don't believe that though, right?
*  No. And then there's this other effect called the broken window effect, which
*  I think it was back in the 60s in New York, what they found is that in streets and neighborhoods
*  where you have buildings that show obvious sign of decay, like that's where the name comes from,
*  broken windows or litter that actually would incentivize other unlawful activities. So
*  the similar effect has been observed with like a park. If a park doesn't have any litter,
*  people litter less than when there is litter on the ground. So rather I think it's the opposite.
*  If you truly believe that the ocean is going to be polluted forever and it doesn't really matter,
*  it's already dirty, that's not really a strong motivation to not litter. But if you say, okay,
*  well, ocean is clean now, they did a lot of effort for that. And once it's clean,
*  I think that would actually be a motivation to not litter.
*  I think you're 100% right. I think some of those videos where you see shorelines that are so thick,
*  I don't know what part of the world it is, but that are so thick with plastic,
*  you can't even get into the water, like you can't wade out there and swim.
*  It's so disheartening and you wonder where the world will be if not for people like you that
*  are trying to come up with a solution, where the world will be in 50 years. 50 years ago,
*  this wasn't the case. Now it is. If you could see like a time lapse video of these oceans from like
*  go back to like 1900 to 2019 and then go back before 1900, does relatively unchanged for
*  thousands of years, right? And then all of a sudden this massive change very quickly
*  with the industrial age. Yeah. But again, I believe this is a transition phase. It's like our
*  modern civilization being in its sort of teenage years and we have to grow out of it.
*  I couldn't agree more. I hope this worry that we all have will translate into improvement and
*  progress. And I always say the same thing that we're in some sort of adolescent stage
*  of society and evolution, that we're in this weird sort of state where we're aware of how much we can
*  change our environment, but also still contributing to the detriment of our environment in a
*  non-sustainable way. And then eventually it's going to have to come to a head. You know,
*  when you see people screaming about climate change and all these different things, I mean,
*  this is people realizing that there's a lot going on that maybe not everyone is completely
*  and totally aware of. But I'm with you. I think it's good to be optimistic. It's healthier to be
*  positive. And I think it's logical that people will find a way out of this. I really do.
*  Yeah. Well, you know, I'm not sure whether we'll be right.
*  I'm not sure either.
*  At least I hope we are. I think eventually it's going to be fine. It's just a question
*  how long is it going to take, how much damage will have been done in that period. But realistically
*  it's the only way there is a chance that we figure this out, right?
*  Have you faced any opposition to this? Is there anybody that thinks this is a fruitless idea?
*  Because I know there were people that were actually, I was very shocked. I read people
*  that were actually happy that your project didn't work the first time. I'm like, what the fuck, man?
*  There's people that I think it's a young thing. Like, because you're this really hopeful, young,
*  intelligent guy who comes up with a solution. I think it probably, oh, is he thinking so fucking
*  smart? Oh, fuck him. I hope it fails. And when it failed, people actually enjoyed it.
*  Yeah.
*  Did that hurt?
*  No. So for me, so yes, of course, since the, really since the beginning of 2013, there have
*  been people, relatively small group of people, but there have been people that have been opposing it.
*  And most of them, ironically enough, are people that care about the ocean because they don't feel
*  it's the right way to tackle the issue. And so the way I deal with it is at least what I used to do
*  in the beginning. Now, unfortunately, there aren't many new arguments anymore, but just
*  write them out, every single argument, rationally analyze them, no emotions, emotions only model
*  your thinking in that way, and make a distinction. Okay, is this something where this person has a
*  point? If so, great, because rather have somebody else pointing it out to me than us having to learn
*  it in the field and having a unnecessary failure. And if the person doesn't have a point, and if
*  it's just assumption or unfounded or whatever, then it's very easy for me to just ignore it.
*  So and then the question is, well, what motivates people to be negative? And I think there's pretty
*  four reasons. First of all, it's, you know, genuine skepticism, whether it can be done.
*  And I think that's healthy. And I think we've proved most of those arguments wrong now. But
*  of course, there's still the whole scale up thing, which we still have to do. So still a bit of that,
*  but it's kind of morphing now to a few other things. Like one thing is human risk perception,
*  which sometimes I think is a cause of some opposition where it's very easy for people to
*  ignore the baseline when they look at risks. So, you know, you can, for example, say, okay,
*  nuclear power, super risky, we shouldn't do that. But then if you compare it to the baseline of
*  other sources of energy, that's actually probably the least risky source of energy there is even
*  solar energy is causes more deaths per megawatt hour than than than nuclear power, because people
*  fall off roofs. So it's really so if you ignore the baseline, and if you say, okay,
*  doing this cleanup, we shouldn't do it because there's all these potential risks, right? So if,
*  you know, potentially, there is some sea life that may be caught, potentially, there are these moral
*  hazards, there's all these risks. And, you know, basically, best thing to do is not do it. What
*  people then are ignoring is sort of the certain hazard of this hundreds of millions of kilos that
*  of plastic that's already in the ocean. And if you were to kind of pose the opposite question and say,
*  okay, so if we were to go to the ocean right now, and just dump the equivalent amount of plastic
*  that we were to take out, we'd dump it into the ocean, which you would you think that's a good
*  plan. And then, well, probably the answer is no. So I think there's a bit of this, you know, of
*  course, of course, what we're doing, it's new, there are risks involved. But as long as we,
*  you know, map them well, we take things step by step, I think they're manageable. And they're
*  definitely not risks or reasons to not do it. Because, of course, the baseline is that there
*  is already doing a lot of harm being done by the status quo. So I think that's one argument.
*  Behind people's opposition. There's also a bit of zero, what I call zero sum game bias, where
*  people are saying, well, you shouldn't do this, because the resources will be better spent elsewhere.
*  I saw an op-ed in Wired a few weeks ago, where people were saying, well, or just one person,
*  actually was was writing where this person said, you shouldn't worry about the plastic pollution
*  issue, you shouldn't do anything about it, because climate change is the biggest issue.
*  And our attention should go there. Plastic pollution is just a distraction.
*  And that's foolish. Well, yeah, I think, you know, there's seven and a half billion people
*  in the world. And we can do more than one thing at the same time. Yeah, that mean, should you not
*  wash your dishes because your carpet is dirty? It doesn't make any sense. Both of them are a problem.
*  I clean both of them. This is this idea that you should only think about climate change.
*  So don't think about the giant Pacific garbage passage twice as big as Texas. Are you fucking
*  serious? It's a dumb argument. Both of them are important to think about both of them important.
*  But a part of writing an article today is writing something that people will get upset about.
*  That's part of it is like generating outrage, clickbait stuff, having controversial opinions,
*  being a contrarian. All those things are profitable today. I mean, it's a giant part of
*  why people write articles. They don't write articles. They don't write articles to state
*  an objective, well thought out perspective. Always. Sometimes people do. But a lot of times
*  people make some click baity bullshit, and they kind of twist a story and twist an idea who you
*  are, twist it to sort of make their narrative make more compelling, be more compelling and
*  sell more or click more and get more ad sales. Yeah, I wonder whether that's in part behind
*  the growing tribalism and polarization that you see everywhere. Social media. I mean, the fact that
*  Facebook's algorithms in a sense support outrage, right? Like these things are designed to support.
*  My friend Ari Shafir tested this and it's really interesting because he tested it to find out what
*  does it actually support? What it actually supports is what you're interested in. And if you're
*  interested in being outraged, it'll show you the things that outrage you. So he decided to just
*  only YouTube puppies. And that's all YouTube would show him. It's puppies. He's like, no,
*  you assholes. This is what you're into. If you're into fucking getting mad about the border and
*  getting mad about the climate and getting mad about abortion and getting mad about whatever the
*  fuck it is, that's what it'll show you because that's what you're interested in. My YouTube feed
*  is mostly muscle cars and fights. Why? Because that's what I'm interested in. And occasionally
*  science things. But that's just because that's what you search for. It'll show you what you
*  search for. I'm sure you're somewhat happy that it shows you those things. Yes, sure. I don't think
*  it's as sinister as people want to say it is. I think the issue is human nature. We are compelled
*  to get upset about things. And I think a lot of it is people that feel disempowered in their own
*  existence. The people that you were talking about that are stuck in cubicles and that are staring at
*  that clock waiting for the buzzer to ring so they can go home. Those people are online. They're
*  tweeting. They're taking a shit and doing fuck this guy's little kid thinks he's going to fix
*  this fucking thing, fixing shit. There's a lot of what's going on. There's a lot of people that are
*  upset because it's fun to be upset when your life sucks. It's fun to shit on somebody. It's fun to
*  get mad about the border. You don't live in fucking South Dakota. You're nowhere near the border.
*  What are you worried about? What you're worried about, you're just angry. People are just angry.
*  You know, it's like these aren't logical discussions that people are having. They're
*  shout offs. And it's a natural part of human nature to get upset about stuff. And even someone
*  who's doing something as beautiful as your perspective or your idea, instead of just saying,
*  look, this guy is doing something amazing. We need someone like this who's just as innovative
*  and just as inspired to try to tackle this climate issue. We need more people like him. This is
*  amazing. Instead of that, you're spending your resources incorrectly. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah.
*  You got you though. You're talking about it. Yeah. Sure. And yeah, I suppose it's from the
*  perspective of the person who writes that. He thinks he's got a point. Yeah. And indeed,
*  if you're just saying what everyone else says, nobody would see your opinion. Exactly. That's
*  a big part of it. Well, journalists are fucked right now. And it's not their fault. It's just
*  print journalism is almost on the way out in terms of buying things, buying newspapers and
*  buying magazines. Their numbers are radically down. So they resort to online things. Well,
*  in the online world, you have so much competition. You have competition from a million different
*  things that people can choose to look at or read. And to get them to read a fucking article,
*  you got to have something good in there. So you have to distort. You have to inflame. You have to
*  get people polarized. You got to get them upset. You got to paint a picture that makes you want
*  to click on this. Like, what is he doing? That fucking idiot's wasting his time trying to pull
*  track. Doesn't he know what Greta Thornburg has been saying? How dare you? That's what's going on,
*  man. But it's just a fun, weird time for humans. There's a lot of negative things,
*  but there's also a lot of positive things. It's a fun, weird time. There's a lot going on and it's
*  happening very, very, very quickly. And the prognosticators, the people that are trying to
*  have some sort of an idea of where this is all going, no one really knows. And change is happening.
*  It's such a rapid pace that it scares everybody. So they're looking to define things and they're
*  looking for control and they're looking to be the person who's got it figured out because nobody's
*  got it figured out. It's madness. The earth is heating. The fucking ice caps are melting. The
*  fish are disappearing. People are eating dolphins. It's madness. It's madness out there. The fucking
*  garbage patch is growing and growing and growing. And if it wasn't for someone like you, who's
*  actually acting and doing something about it, it would just get worse. You have a workable solution.
*  You should be applauded. Fuck that guy. You heard me. Right, Jamie? Fuck him hard. Jamie agrees.
*  Consensus. Yes. Consensus is fuck that guy. But I get-
*  Consensus doesn't create clicks, so maybe we need some-
*  That guy is trying to make a living. Or she or there or they. They're trying to make a living.
*  I understand. In this day and age, you have to have things you have to write about.
*  So they write about things and it might not necessarily be honest.
*  Yeah. So how do you incentivize the truth? That's the question.
*  Again, I think we're in this transitionary phase. And I also think technology is going to make a
*  lot of what we're concentrating on obsolete. I think we are really, really close to some crazy
*  breakthroughs in terms of distribution of information that's going to make it obsolete.
*  And people aren't going to care as much about clickbaity things because you're going to be able
*  to feel things from digitally created media. I think we're very, very close to augmented reality
*  becoming an essential part of people's lives. The same way your phone has become an essential
*  part of your life. 20 years ago, no one carried a phone around. It was very rare. 1999, a small
*  percentage of people had phones on them. Now it's 100%. All this stuff is happening at this
*  exponentially increasing rate. When they implement augmented reality- and who was telling us that
*  Apple's somewhere around 2021- Man, I've been looking that up. I mentioned it once or twice.
*  You definitely did. It might have been you. But some other folks have brought it up too that
*  Apple's really close and they're in the process right now of developing some sort of augmented
*  reality goggles. And they'll be like glasses. You put on a pair of just like this, but you'll be
*  seeing all these things in front of you. You'll be able to move them around. You'll be able to see
*  navigation. You'll be able to turn it on and off. It'll probably work on Siri. You'll be able to
*  talk to it. And you're going to be able to get video and information written, podcasts, all these
*  things. Music. It's going to come through this. And probably this is one step in this ever increasing
*  trend of us getting further and further immersed in technology. And augmented reality will lead
*  to some sort of impossible to determine virtual reality where it's indistinguishable from regular
*  reality. We're like 50 years away from literally being in the matrix.
*  I think it's underappreciated how much our behavior is also guided by technology. I mean,
*  of course, we have our genes, our genotype, which kind of lies at the most fundamental level of how
*  our behaviors are formed. That's why there is such a thing as human nature. But then there is this
*  whole sort of cultural layer that we humans created around us, which I call the technosphere. Maybe
*  other people have different names for it. But it's indeed everything red. We interact with something
*  like 30,000 inventions or 30,000 technologies through our entire lives. That's a huge amount.
*  And I think that environment that shapes your behavior, it decides what kind of genes are
*  expressed. And the interesting thing is that it's not just a natural environment, but it's an
*  environment we create. So probably, now when you think about people being born thousands of years
*  ago, their genes were very, very similar to the people today. Yet, how they behave is completely
*  different. Look again at violence. And why is that the case? Well, it's thanks to these inventions,
*  not just physical inventions, but also cultural inventions and institutions that we created that
*  shapes our behavior. And probably, human behavior is very hard to change unless it actually
*  benefits what we do. Look at smartphones, how fast that happened versus how long it takes for
*  smoking to go away. One is incentivizing the continued use of it through addictive products,
*  while with smartphones, it's something that you want to use. So I just wonder whether
*  that interaction between humans and the technology that we create incentivizes
*  inventors to become morally better and better. Because they are... Did you lose me already?
*  No, no, no.
*  The question is...
*  Well, people are incentivized primarily by profit, right?
*  Right. But the behavior that people express is kind of shaped by the world they live in. And
*  who knows? Maybe a person today is more incentivized to do good things because of
*  the environment that has been created rather than a thousand years ago.
*  No, I think that's absolutely the case. And I hope that people's ability to express themselves
*  through social media, although it's often negative and bitchy, sometimes also can give you
*  a sense of the moral landscape of the culture. Not just the people on the far fringes that are
*  the most angry and vehement about things, but people that have objective, real, rational thoughts.
*  The fact that you were able to read that article and objectively assess whether or not someone has
*  any good points or not. We could all do that about everything. If people had that sort of
*  perspective, instead of being so reactionary, instead of being so angry about things, just look
*  at criticisms, look at possibilities, look at all these different things, and then shape technology
*  to fit within our ethical and moral boundaries. And also, it's very profitable, right? Because
*  if things don't feel, if you don't have a guilty feeling about buying something,
*  every time I get a plastic straw now, I feel guilty. If there was something that people,
*  they innovate to the point where you don't feel guilty supporting products and you feel like this
*  company has the same sort of ethics and ideas that you have, that's all good. And I think we're moving
*  more towards that. But again, we're dealing with a very short window of time where human beings have
*  had to adapt to this incredible amount of change that takes place during a small period of time.
*  S1 05.01 Yeah, it's kind of the, one way to look at problems is that it's kind of this chasm between
*  human nature, human behavior, and how we want the world to be. And indeed, social media,
*  that's the case, but similarly for environmental problems. We humans are driven by certain things,
*  and self-interest is definitely a big part of it. And yet, that's not creating the world right now
*  that we want to live in because the technosphere, the technology that is the interface between
*  the world, sort of nature and human nature, that interface is not compatible with both. So,
*  you either have something that's compatible with human nature. So, it's like a big car with a V8
*  engine, but that's not compatible with nature. Or you have something that's compatible with nature,
*  which is probably walking, but it's not really compatible with human nature because we're
*  lazy and greedy. S2 06.00 It's cold outside and you got to get somewhere in a snowstorm.
*  S1 06.00 Exactly. So, ideally, what we do is rather than trying to change humans, which I
*  don't think is a very futile activity because there is such a thing as human nature, we have genes,
*  we have this evolutionary history. Rather than trying to change that, I think it's much more
*  effective to change the technology around us that enables our inner desires and behaviors to
*  be positive rather than negative. S1 06.00 I agree with you. I think it's going to be difficult,
*  though, to get that same sort of positive result when it comes to our addiction to technology,
*  our addiction to smartphones in particular. I mean, for a long time, it was like televisions,
*  right? Like people talked about how much kids watch TV. Kids watch TV eight hours a day. It's
*  so much. It's so bad. You don't really hear that anymore. You hear about phones. And this is sort
*  of an undiscussed rapid shift in what we waste our time doing. And most of it is what you hear
*  people talking about. And most of the use of these phones, I'd be willing to bet a giant chunk of
*  that social media. S1 06.00 Yes. Yeah. And I suppose that's, again, this sort of infantile
*  stage of that technology, I suppose. S1 06.00 Now we're infantiles. Adolescent before,
*  now you're dropping it down. S1 06.00
*  I think you're right. S1 06.00
*  Yeah. Again, probably we can engineer social media and our information technology to
*  incentivize people to do good things. But indeed now it's probably incentivizing the use of
*  scrolling through timelines because you watch more ads. S1 06.00
*  Also, I think it's our bodies and our minds and the way we view the world. We're not designed
*  to live in this digital realm. This is a completely new thing for the species. And I think we don't
*  really know how to handle the dopamine rush that we get from clicking on Instagram and scrolling
*  through your feeds and checking your DMs and reading your emails and constantly interacting
*  with people and checking, did he text me back? Oh, what did he say? Oh, well, that's interesting.
*  What about this and that and this and that? You're just all day, all day interacting with
*  some digital device. We're not made for this. We're supposed to go outside. S1 06.00
*  And then you have very bright engineers somewhere in a big shiny building, A B testing all day to
*  see whether a red dot on a certain icon in the social media app makes people click more or less.
*  S1 06.00 Yes.
*  S1 06.00 Yeah.
*  Instagram is kind of dabbling with this idea of taking away the likes.
*  S1 06.00 Right.
*  S1 06.00 Like what if we just didn't show anybody the likes?
*  S1 06.00 Right.
*  You don't know how many likes you get. You put up a picture. It's just a fucking picture. Move on.
*  S1 06.00 Yeah.
*  S1 06.00 No. You put up a picture. He got 70,000 likes for that picture.
*  S1 06.00 Right.
*  What the fuck, man? You check it, check it an hour later. 74,000.
*  S1 06.00 Right.
*  Oh, it's going viral.
*  S1 06.00 Yes.
*  It's weird. That likes thing is one of the weirdest drugs. Nobody saw it coming. And people get
*  addicted to saying things that get likes, right? Putting things up that are socially conscious
*  to let everybody know how virtuous you are.
*  S1 06.00 Exactly.
*  S1 06.00 Gives them likes.
*  S1 06.00 Yeah. And it's all making use of, I suppose, the flaws of our human nature.
*  What I'm worried is that one day those likes will actually be a physical feeling.
*  S1 06.00 Oh, yeah. You get like a-
*  S1 06.00 A little jolt, a little love jolt. And they'll engineer the system
*  to get you to seek those constant love jolts.
*  S1 06.00 Yes.
*  S1 06.00 Why not? I mean, if they're going to give you augmented reality, we are how many
*  generations? I don't know, away from something being embedded in your body. People have already
*  decided to do that. Was it a guy or a girl embedded a fucking Tesla Model 3 key in their arm
*  so that they didn't ever have to have their key in their pocket? They could just walk up to their
*  Tesla and the fucking door unlocks. Does that mean climbing-
*  S1 06.00 Software updates. Key doesn't work anymore.
*  S1 06.00 How about it runs out of batteries? They got to cut you open like a fish.
*  I mean, what the fuck are people doing?
*  S1 06.00 Those are people at the fringes.
*  S1 06.00 They are at the fringes.
*  But there's more of them than you think. And if they make it more, they make it simple.
*  Like you just need like a flu shot. They just injects on you.
*  S1 06.00 I wonder whether there is any sort of innate fair or a version towards
*  crossing that interior-exterior boundary with technology.
*  S1 06.00 Fair is a good way of looking at it, right? Like what is fair? Is it fair if you agree
*  to do it? Like, look, is it fair if you decide to get a face tattoo? Right? If it's up to you,
*  man. If it's fair, it's like, hey, man, my credit card company told me they'd give me 10% off if I
*  stick this credit card chip under my skin somewhere. S1 06.00 Yes. I suppose if you
*  again incentivize it with selfish interests, maybe it will take off.
*  There's that. And there's also the big concern is, what if these, I mean, we're talking about
*  income inequality in this world, a big one would be what if there's a jump that you can make
*  in enlightenment and intelligence, access to information, number crunching, the ability to
*  assess risk versus reward. This is all done computer wise. And it's done through some sort
*  of additional piece of hardware that they give you or put in your body, but it costs a lot of
*  money. So the people that can afford it initially are the people that are valuable. They have money
*  in the first place. So the wealthy people are ready because it's very valuable. But then the
*  people that really need it, they can't afford it. So by the time it becomes something, all the money's
*  gone. Everybody's chewed it all up. Everybody's figured out how to hack the system. S1 06.00
*  You should become a writer for Black Mirror. S1 06.00 That seems like a Black Mirror episode.
*  Seems like it would work, right? Yeah. Well, that's what people are worried about when it
*  comes to longevity too, right? They're worried about technological innovations that are allowing
*  people to, you know, nanobots and all sorts of different weird things are going to repair cells
*  and allow people to live for extended periods of time. But then who are these people going to be?
*  Are they going to be the king class? You know, are they going to be this super duper wealthy people
*  of the future that are going to, you know, hold this over the poor folks who can't afford the
*  technology? Yeah. Yeah. So it truly seems like the technologies that we're developing, or that at
*  least are not too far away, our institutions aren't ready yet to really cope with those.
*  Because definitely that would be probably increase inequality quite a lot.
*  Yes, that is one of the major concerns when it comes to this sort of rapid change that we're
*  facing right now. You know, another one, of course, is artificial intelligence. There's
*  people that I respect very, very much that have a very negative view of what the future of
*  artificial technology is going to mean to the human race. Sam Harris and
*  Elon. Yeah, both of them scare the shit out of me every time I talk about it.
*  Yeah. Sam and I did an episode and he talked about artificial intelligence and the rise of it and the
*  fact that once it's uncorked, it's really not going to be able to be put back in the bottle.
*  We talked about it for like an hour and a half. After it was over, like the rest of the day,
*  I was bummed out. Sure. I was like, this is inevitable.
*  Yeah. Yes. So, I suppose I have a very optimistic and pessimistic view of technology at the same
*  time. I think on one hand, it allows us to improve the world and that's what we've seen.
*  And it's gradual and it continues probably because people want to solve their own problems and with
*  that inadvertently solve other people's problems. That's how progress happens, I believe.
*  But then at the same time, while the world is getting a lot better, it's also getting riskier.
*  I mean, 2000 years ago or maybe even 200 years ago, there was no way to wipe out humanity.
*  There simply wasn't. Even if you wanted it to happen very badly, you could scream,
*  wouldn't happen. Now though, there are actually people who have the power to do that.
*  And rapidly. The whole of humanity could be wiped out in a day.
*  Yeah. And now it's fortunately just a few people. But imagine if that goes from a few people to
*  quite a few corporations to maybe even everyone. I think there's this
*  sort of brain teaser or mental experiment that Nick Bostrom came up with that says, well,
*  what if you could have this atomic bomb that you could just make yourself in your microwave?
*  It's like, well, maybe at some point in time, it would just not be economically feasible anymore to
*  rebuild cities because you just would...
*  Too much just nuclear malls, huh? Oh my God.
*  So I don't know. So on one hand, I think that's kind of the scary, risky aspect of it. But
*  at the same time, when you think of it, I would much rather trust or entrust an average person
*  today with the button for nuclear detonation device than somebody a thousand years ago.
*  Oh, for sure. One of the Mongols or someone. Some savage just said, that's good. Nick Bostrom
*  freaked me out, man. We had a conversation about probability of life being a simulation.
*  That's a very high probability. It's more probable that we're in a simulation now than we're not.
*  And my puny monkey brain...
*  Connect to some logic, yeah.
*  Yes. That's where it gets weird. When you deal with the number of potential civilizations out
*  there, the number of human beings, the amount of time that life has had a chance to evolve,
*  not just here, but everywhere in the entire universe, where the possibility is that
*  a simulation has occurred already, very high, where the possibility is that we're in a simulation
*  right now, also pretty high.
*  Yeah. Simply because there's only one base layer of simulation.
*  Also, life seems fake. It seems weird. There's so much of it that seems like, boy, this is...
*  A few weeks ago, I saw a duck in a pond just making infinite circles. That's definitely a glitch.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Someone needs to fix the code.
*  Debug the shit. Yeah. Of course, it's lots of fun to think about those things, but
*  I suppose the depressing thing is that we'll likely never know.
*  Well, maybe.
*  Maybe one time somebody will figure out the solution.
*  This dystopian view of the future, I get the perspective. I get the dystopian perspective.
*  Right now, as we said, according to Pinker, according to statistics, things aren't really
*  better than they've been before. My concern is that... My concern is one of the things that Elon
*  said, where the biological bootloader for artificial life... Look, when a caterpillar makes a cocoon,
*  it doesn't know what the fuck it's doing. It just does it. It just makes a cocoon and becomes a
*  butterfly. We're buying the iPhone 36 and the cyber trucks and trying to get a solar-powered
*  plane off the ground. We're probably giving in to this thing. Look, what we have right now is more
*  than sufficient for survival. If we had just decided, if we got all the people in the world to say,
*  hey, watches, we make watches that keep perfect time. Computers, they get online. It's great.
*  You can download YouTube videos. Cameras, they're very clear. They take very clear pictures.
*  TVs look great. Everything looks great. Internet speeds, pretty fucking good, man, especially with
*  5G. Let's stop. Everybody stop. Stop. Stop making stuff. Everything we have right now,
*  just keep making it. No new innovation. Let's just enjoy life together. That sounds so logical,
*  but yet also so ridiculous. No one's going to agree to that. iPhone 37 is already in production,
*  bitch. It's going to be better and faster. It's going to wrap around your dick and keep you
*  comfort at night. They're going to figure out better stuff no matter what forever. It's part
*  of what makes people people. We have this unquenchable thirst for innovation. That's
*  one of the weird things that freaks me out about this move towards technology is that materialism,
*  which seems to be this really standard behavior with a giant percentage of the population.
*  People are really into things. This desire to have the newest, greatest things is what propels
*  innovation because there's a financial incentive. People are making money off of selling you these
*  better watches that you don't really need or these better cars or these better computers.
*  All these things just keep getting better and better and better and better. A lot of it is fueled
*  by this weird desire that people have for stuff, which doesn't make any sense. Where did that come
*  from? Well, that might be the stuff that makes the caterpillar make the cocoon.
*  It's probably just making use of the same biological mechanisms as social media. You feel like you need
*  it. Yep. Tricks, little tricks. Next thing you know, they go, listen, we have two options.
*  Either we let artificial life take over and be the superior life form or we merge.
*  Let's just make friends. Let's just make friends with artificial intelligence.
*  Take this little chip boy on. Yeah. Well, so probably if it's possible and it likely is,
*  it's probably pretty inevitable that it's going to happen. I think it was Edison that said that
*  I never invented anything. I just took elements of what was there. I probably, the quote is a lot
*  better than I'm paraphrasing now, but if it's possible, it's there. It's in the air. Right.
*  It just needs to be invented. Figured out. Yes. You just have to discover it.
*  Marshall. So probably that's going to happen, but what does give me hope is that to my point of the
*  nuclear detonator a thousand years ago versus now, it seems like we are getting more responsible
*  and our ability to foresee the future allows us to invent things, but it also allows us to
*  kind of think about the risks and to try and mitigate the risks before they happen.
*  And I don't think there's nearly enough attention given to these existential risks, but
*  the fact that some people are thinking about it is, yeah, it's kind of hopeful.
*  No, I agree. I really do. And I'm posing these things about this dystopian potential future
*  just because it really is probably something that we should think about, but I am hopeful that
*  as technology improves, our understanding of humans improves along with it and also that perhaps
*  some technology, like I'm not exactly sure what this neural link thing is with Elon that he's
*  coming up with, but I think some of it has to do with much more rapid access to information.
*  It has to do with increasing bandwidth. Yeah, increased bandwidth. Yeah. Hopefully that will
*  become, I mean, you don't want to say hopefully some fucking wires they stick in your brain will
*  become standard because that seems like we are merging. I mean, that is merging, right? That's
*  the merge with technology. Marshall McLuhan said, the greatest thing about this, he said,
*  human beings are the sex organs of the machine world. What a great quote, right? Yeah. That's
*  one of those quotes you just go, whoa, fuck, that is exactly what it is. The machine world can't make
*  itself, needs us. Like if we do make artificial life, and McLuhan, I think wrote that in the 60s.
*  Yeah. I think that's from, what is the book? He's got a book, media something, but what is the book?
*  Marshall McLuhan. So it's a broader point that our...
*  Well, the understanding media or media? Understanding media. That's it. 1964. Yeah. 1964.
*  Imagine if that guy called it in 64. So definitely it's a broader point a lot of people make that we
*  are in a way enslaved by our technology. And I think in the book Sapiens by Harari. Yes. Great
*  book. He makes the point about grain enslaving us because the agricultural revolution 10,000 years
*  ago, we didn't really become better according to him. It was less nutritious. It was just a
*  worse way of living than the hunter gatherers did. But it was very good for the population of grain
*  and there was no way back for us. So I suppose, yeah, that's the thing with all our inventions.
*  There are these lock-in effects that can kind of lock us into an inferior position. Yeah. So
*  you know, of course the risk with artificial intelligence is that a similar thing happens
*  and that's not very benign. And yeah, we didn't foresee those consequences that we
*  will be locked in in the year 2065 or whatever. It's one of the more fascinating things about
*  people though that we have the ability to contemplate the possibilities that we have
*  the ability to look at this and go, oh, okay, well, what are we doing here? Hold on. Hold on,
*  we're making a mistake here. Look what wheat's got us doing. Look what rice has got us doing.
*  God damn it. Look how much people there are in the city. There's so many people in the city.
*  What do we got? We're going to feed all these people. Shit. We didn't think of this. We just
*  kept breeding. And you know, that's the big concern when people start developing into new areas,
*  people start expanding the technological or the rather societal sprawl. When you see these
*  urban sprawls just slowly encroaching on new land and pushing out into areas where there was
*  no houses before. That's always weird for me when I drive by a place like Boulder, Colorado does a
*  really good job of limiting the amount of construction that gets done there. They're pretty
*  fierce about it, but even they have been sort of lightening up a little things have been getting
*  built and every now and then I'll drive by like if I'm in Colorado, I'm like, oh, that wasn't there
*  before. Now it's there. Everybody thinks it's harmless. No big deal. Just a new building.
*  Used to be an open field. Who's that helping? It's not helping anyone. And then another building
*  outside of that and another building out. And then, you know, you could, you had the ability
*  to look in time 50 years from now. You see this spread where this weird wart of humanity starts
*  moving across the globe. This cool feature in Google Maps where you can have over Google Earth,
*  where you can have time lapses from satellite photos like past six years. And for example,
*  you look at Dubai 30 years ago, nothing. And you suddenly, oh, that's a crazy example. That's a
*  crazy example. That place is so strange. It's like Las Vegas, some steroids. Yeah, Las Vegas
*  on steroids with its own islands, manmade islands, the shape of the world, like all the different
*  continents in the world. You've seen that? Yeah. And it's not doing like it's some of it. Apparently
*  they have to like keep adjusting because the tide rises and the pretty, the actually is this the
*  Google Maps thing? Oh, another one. But this is another one in Dubai. Oh my God. This is insane.
*  This is insane. It's happening so fast. How many years is this spanning? 20. Oh my God. That's
*  amazing. So the, um, actually some of our engineers used to work for the treasure and they actually
*  helped build the, uh, the Palm islands. And apparently the problem is that, um, the water
*  doesn't really move in the arms of the palms. So it kind of gets stinky and algae. So this prime
*  real estate that just stinks. Oh, no, really? Oh, that makes sense. But the water in between,
*  it would get stale. Of course that makes sense. Fuck. This is bonkers. This video is bonkers.
*  Here you see the, these are actual. Oh, there's the, uh, yeah, that's the thing. So all that water
*  inside. Yeah. It doesn't get recycled. It doesn't move around. No. How the fuck did they had to do
*  that to keep the, like, uh, an ocean break, right? I suppose the water from smashing into it, like the
*  outside rim. You can't just pump everything. So now what do they do with all the stinky water?
*  You just accept it? Good question. That fucking world's tallest building is ba nanas. Right.
*  That thing I've seen pictures that people have taken from the top floor. It doesn't even look
*  real. Like all you flat earthers, you need to go to Dubai. Get up there. You could literally see the
*  curve. Yeah. And when you stand at its foot, like because of its shape, it looks like even taller.
*  Can you see the curve from up there? See if, um, go to, uh, no, thanks. So maybe on an airplane,
*  you can't see it either. You can kind of see it. That's true. With a bit of, yeah, you got to kind
*  of see it. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta be way up. Right. Would you go on one of those virgins trips?
*  They do a virgin spaceship fly above the earth and look down. There's, um, good safety statistics.
*  Right. Good for you. Fucked early adopting. Yeah. It's probably not good to be an early
*  adopter in the space area. What kind of psychos would want to be on that first flight?
*  Well, I suppose Richard, um, would have to go on one of the first ones themselves, right? Oh,
*  if I was him, I would clone myself and put a fake me on that and see if that
*  bitch blows up. I wouldn't trust it. Yeah. What is this? Jamie? Is this,
*  Oh, it's like, Oh my God, I'm getting vertigo. Just looking down. I am freaking out.
*  I get like legit. This is all GoPro. So this is like what flat earthers use to show that the earth
*  is actually flat. It's the perspective shift, but just the height of that goddamn thing makes my
*  palms sweat. I was there last year and there was somebody sticking her phone out of the,
*  no, yes. No, no, no. Oh God damn people are crazy. Yes. I had her, she dropped it and it
*  fell and just went right through someone's fucking head. Like literally like a missile. Boom. Your
*  head would just explode. You're gonna get hit in the head with a cell phone from a mile up.
*  Mother fucker. Mother fucker. People are so crazy.
*  It would take so long to put the word burst mode on a new perspective to that.
*  They should have like an alarm that goes off when someone drops something. Someone can quickly hit
*  an alarm. And by the time it hits the bottom, the bottom floor will hear,
*  they get all back away from the building. These guys are on the tip top. No, shut the fuck up.
*  Oh my God, they're hanging on. I just rushed him. Dude, look at my hands. No, these are like,
*  these guys, this kid's with his dad. It looks like. Oh, his dad's crazy too. Great. You're both
*  fucking nuts. Dude, my hands are sweating right now. I can't handle these. Oh, that dude that
*  we've had on James, Kurt with a K. Is that it? Kingman? Kingman? James, the guy who does those.
*  Is that it? Kingman, right? He does these videos from these fucking places. Kingston.
*  Thank you. Sorry, James. He's American. I smuggled a lot of weed. No, he's a, he lives in England.
*  Okay. And he takes these videos where he's like hanging on by one hand with a fucking selfie stick.
*  Yes. Looking down these giant skyscrapers and my hands sweat so hard. Right. Just watching those.
*  I can't imagine if I was actually doing that. What a terrible fucking instinct or a terrible
*  thing that happens to people. When you see people hanging onto something, your hands sweat.
*  So do your hands sweat when you're hanging on? Yeah, they're just not helping you.
*  That's the worst thing that could happen is your hands get all slippery. Fuck man.
*  Just looking at his channel, it looks like he recently had an accident. He's got a video
*  posted on September 11th, says the day I nearly died and he's got a big old like stitches gash.
*  Well, we talked to him about that when he was on the podcast. Does he think about that? Like,
*  but he's kind of locked into that now. You're sort of married to this idea that you,
*  you know, you're the guy who goes up there and does that. You can't just say, well, I've done it
*  no more. It's like the grain. Yep. It's like the grain. Yeah. He's married to the thrill.
*  Well, Alex Honnold is the best example of that, right? He's this free solo guy. Oh yeah. A free
*  solo climber that goes El Capitan with no ropes. It's, did you watch the, yes. Fuck that. If you
*  keep your eyes open. I've had him on the podcast a couple of times. He freaks me out. I just don't
*  understand how he can do it. I get, I get it. You know, I get that's his thing. He's passionate
*  about it. And again, sweat. My hands are so sweaty. It's just a weird thing that people do where they
*  try to activate their adrenal glands. You know, they try to activate their, their thrill glands.
*  Yeah. I do respect that. I mean, he's, it's his passion and he, he follows this passion.
*  Some people clean the ocean. Some people climb a 45 degree angle backwards. I wouldn't want to be
*  a family, but no. Right. It looks like he might have stopped doing that. I mean, he might be
*  getting paid to still do it as like a stunt person for movies. Cause he did one for a movie recently,
*  but he has a video from this year recently. It says that YouTube demonetized all his videos and
*  he just has been posting car stuff. YouTube is demonetized his videos. Why? Because they don't
*  want to incentivize. Oh, wow. That's interesting. He's had a video explaining it. You could probably
*  talk about it, but I guess at the end of climbing YouTube, demonetized me August 22nd. Wow. That's
*  interesting. There you go. That's interesting. Huh? Being more realistic. Yeah, but here's the
*  thing. They demonetize it, but yet they still have it up and they still have an algorithm that'll
*  click you after his video and suggest a bunch of other shit they're going to monetize. But it might
*  not have ads on it. Right. His video, I'm sure it doesn't have ads on it, but that doesn't mean
*  it's not effectively a part of their system. Like that sort of gets revenue because they're
*  going to recommend a bunch of videos that do have ads and you're going to keep clicking.
*  I think as far as YouTube stands, it's just like if an advertiser saw their ad on this video,
*  we can't be a part of that. Well, I think also from YouTube's perspective, almost all of it is
*  illegal. Very good point. I think that's a big one. I don't think you could do illegal shit on
*  YouTube and get money off of it. Then they would be responsible in some sort of a way.
*  Right? Boy, I'm over here fixing the world, dude. Yeah, done. Anything else?
*  Do we cover it all basically? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Of course, OceanCleanup.com.
*  OceanCleanup.com. People, please go there and help. We'll help too. We'd love to contribute,
*  love to be a part of this for sure. If there's anything else we can do, if there's anything
*  that you need promoted or want to let people know, we'd be happy to help. But thank you. Thanks for
*  being you, man. Thanks for inventing this and thanks for pursuing this so doggedly and being
*  so obsessed with what is an incredibly worthy cause. Appreciate you, man. Well, thanks so much.
*  My pleasure. All right. Bye, everybody. See you.
