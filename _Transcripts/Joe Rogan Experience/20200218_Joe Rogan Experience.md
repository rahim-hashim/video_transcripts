# JRE MMA Show #92 with Angela Hill
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTCgRIA0RYo)
*  Two.
*  Good? Hello Angela. What's going on? That was amazing. You get those headphones on. I was wondering.
*  You got the best afro in the game for sure. It was even close.
*  It condenses. I mean, Casillas got me beat though. Alex Casillas. Yeah.
*  He gets crazy. Yeah.
*  That's my goal. Those are my hair goals is to get like a nice big like fluffy fur like his.
*  When he fights, I always wonder like I get that seems like it would be harder to pull out of things.
*  Don't you think? No, it's actually it's kind of like, you know, those connecting joints where it's like it's kind of like a big ball that goes in.
*  But like when you pull it out, it's like it pulls out easier. It pulls out easier. Yeah. It's kind of like a like a joint like that.
*  So like you think you have a good grip, but then the hair just like, you know, like if you put grease in your hair or hair conditioning or anything that makes it extra slippery, right?
*  Yeah, I guess. But like it's it's pretty it's just the fact that it can go small even though it doesn't look like it.
*  I feel like people think they have a better grip than they do.
*  Like I think my title fight in Invicta, the girl locked on like maybe three or four guillotines.
*  And every time I was just like, you know, like it just like popped out and people kept going, it's deep, it's deep.
*  But like I swear to God, my Afro gets me out of tight situations.
*  It's interesting with women fighting, like there's options. And one of the options is clothes.
*  Like the way you wear your upper like your top can have a big impact if you're a grappler.
*  Yeah, I always felt well, I guess I don't feel like that anymore because I realized like with all like the costume malfunctions and stuff, it can be a big deal, especially if you're like really packing, you know.
*  But I used to like hate on girls who would fight in shirts.
*  I'm like, come on, man, you're a fighter. Like let your stomach out.
*  Like this is like a fight fight because like things get tangled up and stuff.
*  Like especially if the shirt isn't like super tight.
*  Right. Like even the girl that I'm fighting in Auckland, she has something weird where like I think the other girl was like pulling on her shirt.
*  So like in between the first and second round, they took a shirt off.
*  So like, fuck it. This is like kind of messing up your grooves.
*  Well, you get an options, right?
*  It's not like you have to have your midriff exposed, which is kind of interesting because it should be uniform, shouldn't it?
*  I mean, women's MMA is the only place where you can make a choice to be stickier.
*  Right. If you're a grappler in particular, if you have like a full shirt on, you can definitely hold on to someone better.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  I don't know. I feel like just a boob thing.
*  You know, you can't have tits out. Like not as a fighter.
*  Like it's OK for the ring card girls to walk around with their cleavage out.
*  But the fighters, like, I don't know, they're trying to, I guess, make it more of an like, OK, these girls are athletes.
*  So don't don't stare at the cleavage while they're fighting.
*  Yeah, it's a fine line.
*  Because you're, you know, basically in your underwear almost.
*  Yeah, pretty much, pretty much.
*  Bathing suits. But I don't know, I always had this joke with like my teammates that I was going to get famous by being like the nip slipper.
*  I would use like certain like Muay Thai clinch techniques to just like pop the girls boob out.
*  So I'd always get to fight the popular girls because like they knew, oh, she's fighting Pageman's aunt.
*  We're going to see some Pageman's aunt titties, you know?
*  And I would just like, you know, raise my stock.
*  I haven't done it though, but you thought about it in training, only in training.
*  I tried on the guys in the gym, lift it straight up.
*  Has anybody ever done that on purpose in a fight?
*  I don't know. I think the one person that backfired with was I don't remember who she was fighting, but Leslie Smith's boob popped out once.
*  Did it really? Yeah.
*  And in one of her Invicta fights and she did not give a fuck.
*  Oh, she's crazy. Yeah, she's crazy.
*  Her ear was hanging off her head at Jessica I-Fight. Oh my God.
*  You could see into her head. Yeah, yeah.
*  She was like, don't stop the fight. Don't stop the fight.
*  I was like, this girl's gangster.
*  She's insane. I love her. I love her. She's crazy.
*  And she's so like nice and like such a hippie, you know, outside of that.
*  So it's like a really funny.
*  What is she doing now? She's still trying to start some MMA union.
*  Yeah, she's still she's still going hard with the union.
*  She's in Balladur now.
*  But I think like the union that she was working on was only for UFC fighters, I believe.
*  So I think she's still doing that.
*  I think she's still fighting for the UFC fighters, even though she's not in the UFC.
*  Does that what it's I haven't looked into that.
*  Like I haven't looked at like what do they what do they want?
*  What are they trying to accomplish? What's not correct that they want to fix?
*  I think just any any grievances that the fighters have in general, so like health care, salary,
*  just things that everyone kind of agrees on is like not good enough yet.
*  You see, I think those are the things that they're working towards.
*  How does health care work? Are you guys covered in training or you only covered for fights?
*  As far as I know, if you book a fight and you get injured, I think they cover it.
*  But I think it's also a gray area where like they could not cover it and they're not legally obligated to fix you.
*  But I think in the past they have.
*  I'm not sure. I can't think of any any examples where they haven't like,
*  you know, taken care of the medical expenses of someone who got hurt.
*  But I know like a lot of times fighters don't claim it in time,
*  like after fights or it's like a little nagging injury that becomes a big deal further down the line.
*  And it happened in the fight, but they waited too long.
*  Yeah, yeah, either that or just, you know, just wear and tear from training in general.
*  Like you can't I can't go in for like a loose tooth or like or like a shoulder that I tore in practice if I wasn't getting ready for a fight.
*  Well, that seems so crazy because you're obviously fighting in the UFC. You have a long term contract.
*  You've been fighting in the UFC for years. If you're training, you're training to fight in the UFC.
*  Yeah, exactly. And I think I think a lot of instances they still take care of the fighter.
*  But I know like if you're like on the lower end, if you haven't really made a name for yourself yet,
*  sometimes, you know, even if you just don't ask, like you don't get taken care of,
*  it's not like it's not in your contract once you sign like, oh, I'm going to fight this many fights.
*  But there's nothing in there that says if I get injured after signing this contract, I'm covered medically.
*  So so yeah, I think that was that was the main reason I was like, oh, this is a good idea.
*  Just because like I know so many fighters who book fights just to get their injuries taken care of, you know,
*  or they they'll fight injured and claim an old injury and like and that's their way of fixing whatever they broke during training.
*  So that sucks. It's horrible. It's such a fucking crazy way to make a living.
*  Period. Yeah. You know, it's like you're you're deciding you're going to throw your bones at someone and try to break their arms and try to rip their legs apart.
*  And this and then you're going to practice that all the time and then you're going to hope you don't get hurt in practice to the point where you can't actually just go do it inside the octagon.
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. And most of my injuries happen outside of camp because I'm either training stupid training with someone I who I shouldn't be training with,
*  like someone too big or too inexperienced or or I'm just like fucking around.
*  Like when I'm fighting someone who's my size, it's a lot less likely that I get injured.
*  But when I'm throwing my bones, like you said, at somebody who's way bigger than it's easy, I can hurt my hand punching them, you know, break my break my leg or break my toe, like kicking them.
*  You know, that's for someone like you who fights at one hundred and fifteen pounds.
*  It's even more difficult, right, because the lack of people that are your size to train with and you're also trained a lot with men.
*  And it's it's crazy because at a professional level, like you're you're right there.
*  You know, you just beat the shit out of Hannah Seifers. It was a crazy fight.
*  Thank you. But that was a big fight for you. Yeah. Like you're you're in the heat right now. Yeah.
*  I mean, you're right there. Yeah. So for you, you're you're you're at the top of the heap in this championship realm.
*  Right. And to train with people that are bigger than you or to take chances like that, like there's no other sport that would have that.
*  Yeah. You know. Yeah. And it's like the lack of women as well, you know, because even if I'm training with like a bantamweight, if it's a woman, like it's not as dangerous as training with like some of the bigger guys.
*  Like the like guys and girls are kind of like different sizes.
*  Like if I'm if I'm training with a guy who fights at 115, he's going to be like four foot tall, you know.
*  So so it's it's like the weight distribution is different.
*  But like, I don't know, something about, I guess, training with women, like the strength, the the force that's coming at you versus the force you're giving to them.
*  I just feel like it's a lot safer to train with women. Oh, for sure. Yeah, for sure.
*  But some people think that the opposite is that if you train with men, like, say, if you were trained with a bunch of bantamweight men, yeah, they would be bigger than you.
*  Yeah, they'd be stronger than you. But you get used to that.
*  And then you'd be used to men. And then when you fight with women, they would seem smaller and weaker.
*  Yeah. And that's that was my old like theory.
*  So when I was at like my little gym in New York, I was only training with guys like the girls that would come in.
*  They weren't at my level. And that's the same story that most girls in the UFC have.
*  You know, they were the top of their heap. They were like the baddest girl in the gym, you know, beating up all the other girls and hanging with the guys.
*  And that was me. So it wasn't until I got on tough that I realized like everyone has the same exact background.
*  So everyone's tough because they were training with guys and you start to underestimate like how tough a girl's going to be in there.
*  Like when you're fighting like tooth and nail, like, you know, to the death is basically like what you're doing in the cage until the ref pulls you off, you know, and then it's all hugs.
*  But like when you're given like 100 percent in the cage, it feels like just as strong as a guy, you know.
*  So it's good to like still have those checks and balances like, OK, like, yeah, maybe she's not as strong as the guys I train with, but she is going as hard as she can or she's defending it as hard as she can.
*  Or, you know, she's taking my punches that I thought like, oh, if I drop this guy with this punch, then this girl's going to get dropped too.
*  And it's not the case like she's just as tough or tougher.
*  So it's like a weird thing where like you have like, I don't know, you have different stats like stacked in some areas that guys don't.
*  And then they have stats stacked in areas that women don't.
*  So it's like it's like if I was it's like if I was like a bantamweight guy who only trained with like light heavyweights, you know, like you're going to be faster.
*  You're going to have like you're probably going to be more technical just because you have to train with people that big.
*  So if you fuck up a technique, it's not going to work.
*  But those guys are still going to be bigger and stronger and be able to like muscle you, hold you down, that kind of thing.
*  So I feel like that's like a similar difference.
*  Particularly striking, right?
*  Like with with grappling, there's some really little guys that are impossible to tap.
*  They just develop really crazy technique.
*  Yeah.
*  But with striking, there's only so much you could do.
*  You know, if you're a lightweight guy, you're not sparring with Francis Ngono.
*  If you are, he better be really, really, really nice.
*  Exactly.
*  Or you better be nice to him.
*  So he doesn't go like, I love my.
*  If you're not, he's not even going to notice it.
*  If you're not nice to him, it's not even going to work.
*  Well, now I've actually like been told off for going hard with the heavyweights.
*  Like when I when I was like, you know, just coming up like super green and like I was just like, I'm going to kill everyone in the gym.
*  And like this is a little thing like running at you, throwing over hands and like when it land, like my coach would be like, hey, you got to you got to relax because like you're landing over hands on this big guy.
*  If he does the same to you, he's going to put you out.
*  And I was like, shit, I never thought about that because I just assumed like he wouldn't.
*  Yeah. Well, no, not that.
*  I just assumed that like me landing a hard punch on a heavyweight isn't going to hurt as much as me landing a hard punch on someone closer to my size.
*  For sure. That makes sense.
*  No, it won't.
*  Like, their neck is bigger.
*  Yeah, everything's bigger.
*  But it's still like if the guy is getting rocked, then that's bad.
*  If he gets mad at you and fires back.
*  Yeah, if he's getting his head turned and that's it.
*  Like your chin can only take so much.
*  So it's like it's a lot less than like if I was throwing a body shot, you know, like that's it's a little easier to be mean there.
*  You've you've obviously gone through some improvements and some change.
*  Like what's changed with you over the last like four or five fights?
*  Because you keep getting steadily better.
*  But particularly the last two, I think you should be on a four fight win streak because there was.
*  Oh, stop.
*  Well, you have that one decision.
*  I forget how to pronounce her name.
*  Zhaoyingyan.
*  Yeah, is that how you say it?
*  So it's like a cat.
*  How do you say it?
*  I don't know how to say it.
*  But Zhaoyingyan.
*  That's the lady you had in the triangle.
*  Yeah. And she's on this card too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The Auckland card.
*  I thought that was a bad decision.
*  But you had her locked up in the.
*  So I get sometimes when I when I do commentary, people get mad at me like either the fighters or other people.
*  But that was one where fans of her got mad at me because you guys were right in front and you had her in a triangle.
*  And I was yelling, pulled ahead.
*  I was yelling, pull her head, pull her head.
*  You had it locked up.
*  It was locked up.
*  I'm like, she's got it.
*  She's got it. She's got it.
*  I'm like, pull the head, pull the head.
*  And people like you fucking dick telling her to pull the head.
*  I didn't hear you.
*  If I heard you, I thought you were in my corner.
*  I did hear someone say pull it.
*  You were literally right there.
*  It's like, I can't help.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like you had it.
*  That's awesome.
*  You really had it.
*  It was so locked in.
*  But I felt like that was a shit decision.
*  It wasn't the worst decision I've ever seen.
*  We've seen some really bad ones lately, but it was not good.
*  So that would have put you on a four-fight win streak.
*  Right.
*  But the Hannah Seifers one, Hannah Seifers is tough.
*  And she's like physically tough.
*  She's like a strong girl.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you got her down and smashed her with those elbows, I was like, something's going on.
*  Like you're on another level.
*  Do you feel it?
*  Yeah, I do.
*  I do.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  It's I had a lot of like, I don't know, I guess ups and downs in my career.
*  Like it's literally like up down, up down, like win loss and win loss.
*  And I think after the Randa fight, I fought Randa Marcos about this time last year.
*  And I was just so pissed at the way that went down because I was like super nervous going into it.
*  I felt like this that was going to be a fight that kind of set me above the heap because Randa is so tough and she kind of has that same like up down that I do.
*  So I'm like, OK, this is going to set me apart.
*  I'm going to get a streak going.
*  This is going to be the fight that puts me in the rankings.
*  And I and I put a lot of weight on it.
*  And I had like ESPN following me that week, too.
*  So I was just super nervous.
*  And like the entire time during the fight, like I wasn't in the fight.
*  Like I was overthinking every position.
*  Like there was a point where I had ran up against again.
*  The fight seems like it was 30 minutes long, even though it was like two minutes.
*  You know, but like the moment that I had her up against the cage, I remember like just thinking, oh, if I hold her here, she can't do anything to me.
*  And that's like the exact opposite of what you should be thinking in a fight.
*  You should be thinking I need to hurt her.
*  You know, like I need to hurt her.
*  I need to do whatever it takes to look like I'm trying to finish the fight.
*  So I hesitated.
*  My corner was yelling elbow.
*  I didn't throw the elbow, ran it through the elbow.
*  And then from there, I was just like like two steps behind.
*  I felt like. And so that fog was a really weird thing for me because I had never really thought about the mental side of fighting.
*  Like I thought I was doing everything right.
*  Like I would visualize and, you know, tell myself all positive things and, you know, do do everything that you think you have to do before a fight.
*  But that just kind of showed me like I'm not doing enough because I knew I had the skills to beat her.
*  But or at least the skills to make it look more competitive.
*  But I didn't show it.
*  Do you think it was the added element, the cameras following you around that just put this additional pressure?
*  Yeah, like like the pressure was already there.
*  And then I found out about the ESPN thing and I feel like it was just me over it because I've always had this, I guess, this fear of losing too much.
*  You know, and it started when I got into the UFC.
*  I had like my tough fight didn't go well, but I was one fight, you know, in my MMA career and I was in the UFC already.
*  So I went on to win a fight, but then I lost two in a row and got cut.
*  And from that moment on, I'm like, fuck, like people are just going to think of me as this person who loses all the time.
*  And then I went on a four fight, win streak and then Victor.
*  But then when I came back to the UFC, I lost to a drive.
*  And even though it was like probably the fight that people still talk about to this day, even though I lost.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Like I always get complimented on that fight, but it was still another loss on my record.
*  So like I've always had this kind of, I don't know, like this great cloud looming over like my confidence because of my record.
*  Did it help that she went on to do such great things?
*  It did. It did. It did.
*  But when it came to fighting someone like Randa, who kind of had a similar story where she is talented,
*  but she's fought a lot of tough people and lost to them or gotten like weird decisions against people.
*  I don't know. I just felt like this was my chance to prove that I'm not that like I'm a better fighter than my record shows.
*  And so then when the ESP, the end thing was thrown on and I just like it was just me bigging up a situation that wasn't that big.
*  You know, like it was no different from, you know, my fight with Ashley Yoder.
*  I felt more present in my adrod fight.
*  Like it was no bigger than those fights, but I just bigged it up in my head and I felt like it was a result of me just pushing down all this anxiety that I have every time I fight and not really addressing it.
*  So did you address it since then?
*  Yeah, I did.
*  What have you done differently?
*  I just we started reading like those, uh, we me and my husband, but he read them and then he started doing like the mental coach thing for me.
*  But everyone, everything, every resource that I looked at says pretty much the same thing is that you have to focus on being present and being present each day and not like dwelling on the past, not bringing the past into that present moment,
*  just trusting in your reactions and trusting in your, uh, your preparation.
*  And so that's what I've been doing is like, uh, I've I have been doing like more like actual visualization exercises and just every time I'm in the gym, I just focus on being there at the gym.
*  I'm not thinking about like what's going to happen if this happens, what's going to happen if that happens.
*  I just, I focus on the drill we're doing on the exercises we're doing.
*  I go as hard as possible.
*  And I think, uh, just having that fight and having it go so badly forced me to go into the gym and just say, fuck it.
*  You know, and it's literally just like that fuck it mentality.
*  Like that was the worst that could happen where you didn't show up.
*  You didn't fight to the best of your abilities.
*  Exactly.
*  When I hesitated, I didn't show up.
*  I didn't, I didn't stay in the moment.
*  I was thinking about what's going to happen next.
*  What just happened, you know, what's going to happen if I lose?
*  Like I'm thinking that in the fight.
*  Like when I went to the gym the next, like literally like the next Monday, I went to the gym like, fuck it.
*  You know, and I just went hard and like the next sparring session, I said, fuck it.
*  And I went hard.
*  And like those were like the best sparring sessions I had up to that date.
*  Like people were guys, guys who like you usually wouldn't really say much after a sparring.
*  They're like, yo, you're on something today.
*  Like you're, you're like just like combinations and volume and this and that.
*  Like, yeah, you're really getting after it.
*  And like, okay, okay.
*  I think I've like kind of unlocked something.
*  So it's really powerful the way you're addressing it, that you're so honest about what went wrong.
*  That's huge because sometimes people make excuses or they come up with some, some, you know,
*  something that went that didn't go their way that should have gone their way.
*  And they don't address the real issue.
*  You're addressing the actual issue that was going on in your brain and you know that that's what it was.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
*  But it's like something I kind of had to learn from the get-go, you know.
*  Have you ever thought about going to like a sports psychologist?
*  I have. I have.
*  Like there were, I've tried a couple of people in the past and I really just feel like everyone kind of says the same things.
*  So I feel like if you're getting it from any resource, that's good.
*  Like I started using that mindfulness app.
*  Which one?
*  I forget what it's called.
*  Headspace?
*  Yeah, headspace.
*  I was going to say it's the ones with the little cartoons.
*  Yeah.
*  And that, that really helped just like kind of calm my nerves and keep the anxiety from, from being crippling.
*  Sometimes what happens when you go to a coach is the fact that you physically go to someone and you sit down with this,
*  it's like a different level of commitment.
*  You sit down with this person.
*  This person formulates a strategy for how you address some of the issues that are going on in your mind.
*  And then sometimes you can go to a hypnotist.
*  Like Vinny Shorman.
*  Vinny Shorman, do you know Vinny?
*  No, no.
*  Vinny Shorman, he's fantastic and he's done a lot of, he actually hypnotized me.
*  I asked him to hypnotize me because I want to know what it was like.
*  It's very weird.
*  It's very weird.
*  It's like you're there, but you're not really there.
*  It's like you're in a room next to, he didn't touch me.
*  Did he mick you like?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Nothing weird.
*  Like a dog.
*  No, I just wanted to, I just wanted to experience what it was like.
*  And then, you know, like sometimes I procrastinate too much.
*  Sometimes I'm lazy.
*  Sometimes I feel like I get more work done than I do.
*  I'm like, I want to know what that is.
*  You know, and he is really good at working with fighters, at addressing.
*  He does a lot of stuff through like FaceTime and shit too.
*  He lives in England.
*  But he's worked with Joe Schilling.
*  He's worked with a lot of different fighters.
*  But he basically tries to get you to understand.
*  First of all, you're already on a really good path because you understand what you did wrong.
*  Right?
*  And then you understand to be more present.
*  Those two things are critical.
*  That's everything.
*  Understanding what went wrong, letting it go.
*  You're already doing that.
*  And then concentrating on what you're really good at and just saying fuck it and letting it go.
*  And expressing yourself.
*  Being the you that you know that you could be when you're on.
*  Right?
*  It's like how to capture that and hold that thought and then bring it inside the octagon and be able to recreate those feelings when you're actually under pressure of competition.
*  That sounds cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Is he hypnotizing though?
*  Does he take out the watch?
*  No, he just talks to you.
*  He closes your eyes, you lay back and he just sort of talks you through it.
*  It's very weird.
*  So it's not like therapy.
*  You definitely feel like a change in your brain.
*  Yeah, you feel like you're in a different state.
*  It's a weird state.
*  It's very weird.
*  That's strange.
*  After it was over, I was like, huh, okay, that's real.
*  I had seen comedy hypnotism before.
*  Have you ever seen a comedy hypnotism show?
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
*  Where they have a bunch of people come up and like, you're having sex with Rihanna and you think you are.
*  There's a lot of weird stuff that people do in these comedy hypnotism shows where I was like, maybe I can't, I don't think they could do that to me because I'm not going to believe that I'm really on a cruise ship right now and pirates are coming or whatever the fuck.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And they go hide.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But some people do.
*  I always see the ones where they like make him like turn into an animal or something or like, or every time you say this word, something happens.
*  And I'm going to wake up in three, two, one.
*  Huh?
*  What happened?
*  It wasn't like that.
*  Okay.
*  But it is like you're listening to his voice, but you're in a different state of consciousness.
*  It's very strange.
*  Right.
*  But you're able to put away the outside world for a brief amount of time.
*  And he concentrates on flow, getting you to a state of flow, that flow state when everything's going great.
*  You know that feeling when you see things and you're hitting someone with someone with something before you even know that there's an opening there.
*  And that was in those those athlete books to just have flow state thing.
*  Flow state is everything.
*  Right.
*  So getting to the point where you're at that.
*  And then for you is a quick turnaround a better thing because you're more relaxed.
*  You just fought.
*  It's definitely a better thing because I feel familiar with the routine and familiar with like being in the cage.
*  And one of the first things we started thinking about is what scares me so much or what what gives me that heart pain.
*  And one thing is like being in the cage and like seeing the canvas and like just how real it is.
*  Because like when you see it on TV, like the canvas is a different color, you know, like the you can see like the texture.
*  I don't know. Yeah.
*  The texture, the thread in the canvas and you can in I don't know, there's a certain smell like the perspective is different.
*  Like I look way bigger on TV than I do in person.
*  And it's the same with my opponent.
*  Like they look like this little thing trying to like fight me.
*  But it's like this little this real thing in front of me.
*  So it's like scarier than when you're watching it, like watching the replay of your fight.
*  So it's it's just like that.
*  I don't know, just that experience of being in there always scared me because it's I don't know, it's just not familiar.
*  It's not it doesn't feel the same as going to the spa or or like, you know, going to train or wrestle or whatever.
*  Because it's like this big like thing that we build up.
*  We have a date. We go in there.
*  It's a warm up inside the octagon before you fight.
*  I like to get in there.
*  I like to. I mean, if I think it helps.
*  But I think just being in there a lot has helped more than that.
*  Just because like, yeah, like that is that the area that I'm used to fighting in now.
*  Like now that I've fought so much in like a short period of time, like it feels super familiar.
*  Like now I don't feel the need to warm up in there.
*  Whereas before I'm like, oh, I got to get to the I got to get to the arena early.
*  I got to fill the cage. I got to fill it on my feet.
*  Feel how slippery it is, you know, that kind of thing.
*  But yeah, I definitely like being in there, being active.
*  I train all year round. Like I don't really take big breaks unless I like hurt something.
*  So in most of my fights, I come out injury free if I do have injuries from like a fight camp, not from the actual fight.
*  That's really fortunate.
*  Yeah, no, I'm lucky. So I want to, you know, I want to take advantage of my health because I know it's not going to last forever.
*  How old are you now?
*  Twenty-six.
*  Yeah, yeah, that's the magic number.
*  No, I'm thirty-four this year.
*  Yeah, well, you look great.
*  Thank you.
*  When did you start training?
*  I did my first Moistite class when I turned twenty-four.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. So I called it my...
*  Maybe that's the thing, right? Like you don't have the wear and tear of like a lot of people start when they're ten and by the time they get to twenty-four, they already got MCL fucked up and back a mess and necks hurt.
*  And it probably stunts your growth too a little bit. I don't know. I feel like something happens.
*  If you cut weight, it certainly does.
*  Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I didn't really do any sports after, I guess, middle school.
*  And from middle school through high school to college and then after college, I didn't do shit.
*  You didn't do anything?
*  No, I was skinny fat, so I didn't have to.
*  But you didn't work out or nothing?
*  No, I didn't work out.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah, it's weird. If you see a picture of me from like right after college, I look like this little skinny like stick figure, like just soft girl. It's really weird. So like when people see me now, they're like, holy shit.
*  From people from back then?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, they must be freaking out now. Like she's a what?
*  Yeah.
*  She's in the fucking what? She's a UFC contender.
*  I know.
*  Get the fuck out of here. Angela?
*  No, it's really funny. Yeah, exactly. Like nobody. And I was so different. Well, not different, but I was like super quiet like all my life, like high school, especially college.
*  Like I was always just like really shy and really like soft spoken.
*  That's surprising because you're very funny on Twitter.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  On Twitter, you're hilarious.
*  Well, I was always funny.
*  You were always funny, just quiet.
*  Nobody knew it. Yeah, I kept it to myself. I crack myself up all day. But yeah, like I'm just super shy, like always awkward around like new people and new settings.
*  And like I had my tight knit group of friends, but like I was never like the popular kid by any means.
*  So what brought you into Muay Thai class?
*  A workout.
*  You just needed time to do.
*  I was just fat. Yeah. I just got married and I also had an office job. I was working at an animation studio.
*  And before that, I had been bartending. So I was like moving around and doing stuff and I never really felt like inactive.
*  But once I quit the bar job and was just doing that full time, I just felt like fat and lazy and greasy and you know, everything that happens from like sitting down all day.
*  So, I mean, you know, you like you do all sorts of shit outside of this just to like, you know, stay happy.
*  Yeah, it was really cool discovering it.
*  Like I was just asking around because I always want to learn how to fight.
*  But like boxing intimidated me and like they're not going to want to deal with me like, you know, like they deal with me if I came in when I was like 10.
*  But now some old ass fucking girl want to learn how to box.
*  But then people are telling me like, oh, Muay Thai is like really cool.
*  And I was afraid of getting bulky, you know, and they're like, oh, no, if you do Muay Thai, like you'll still look really natural.
*  You won't look like you're on steroids.
*  I was like, oh, okay. I think girls are afraid of that.
*  You're afraid of big shoulders and big arms. Yeah, I mean, no, I don't care.
*  I'm like, bring it on. But back then I was like really worried about looking like a ninja turtle.
*  That's so funny because it's so hard for a girl to look like that without steroids. Yeah.
*  But you see some girls who go hard, you know, like the CrossFit girls.
*  Half my opponents. They're just all trapped up.
*  Yeah, there's a few. There's a few that you definitely know something happened in the past.
*  Something happened. They grew up on a farm.
*  Oh yeah. A little thrown hair around.
*  So you're 24 years old. You walk into Muay Thai class. When do you get addicted to it?
*  First class, man. First class.
*  First class. My first coach, Brandon Levi, does evolution Muay Thai in New York.
*  So that's where you were in New York at the time?
*  Yeah, in New York. Yeah, that's where I went to school and everything.
*  And first class, I threw like an elbow and a knee on the tie pads and I was like, oh, because it feels so hard.
*  And like I never knew that I could generate that much power with my like little body
*  because I was probably like 115 pounds like wet, soaking wet, you know, at the time.
*  So I was just like, oh my God, like I feel so powerful.
*  And like ever since then, I was just going every day. I was going with my husband.
*  Like we were like getting in shape, learning how to kick and stuff.
*  And it was just like a lot of stuff I never thought I'd be able to do. I was doing it.
*  Like even just throwing a head kick.
*  I didn't like try out for cheerleading because I was inflexible.
*  You know, I was like, I'm never going to be able to do this.
*  I can't do a high kick. I can't do a split or anything like that.
*  So being able to get my leg up high enough to kick someone in the head, like it was like a huge milestone for me athletically.
*  I love a story like that where you didn't do shit from like middle school, high school.
*  You didn't do shit till you're 24 and then all of a sudden you get addicted to it.
*  Yeah, yeah. It was always in me.
*  And then 10 years later, you're a top contender in the UFC.
*  Yeah. That's bananas.
*  It's weird, but like it makes sense to me because like anytime I tried to do a sport when I was a kid, I would just lose interest.
*  And I think it was because they were all team sports.
*  Like it was on basketball team, softball, baseball, whatever.
*  I ran a track for like a few months and all of that stuff.
*  I was just like, this is stupid. Like, what's the point?
*  You know, or that or I don't know. I didn't like working with people.
*  But the one thing I was good at was stealing the ball in basketball.
*  So like I'd never made any shots like I was really bad at like dribbling and everything.
*  But if someone got the ball and they were next to me, I'd run over and I grab it and just like wriggle until they're just like, like they would just get mad at me and let go of the ball.
*  So I'd steal it and then pass it to the girl that could shoot.
*  So yeah, that was the one thing I was good at.
*  That's conflict. Yeah.
*  Maybe that was like a sign of things to come. Exactly.
*  Exactly. I like that. I like that.
*  And especially because I was so shy outside of that, then it was just kind of like my outlet.
*  So how long was it between your first class and your first fight?
*  It was about nine months.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  So right away you're like balls deep into this.
*  Yeah.
*  For lack of better.
*  Yeah. I'm like, what else deep could I?
*  What can a girl do?
*  Yeah.
*  I was yeah, I was really into it and I hadn't considered fighting yet.
*  But my coach was like, I think it was around the time.
*  Have you ever heard of the WKAs?
*  So it was around the time of that and he was taking a couple of people down.
*  He was like, hey, you want to do WKAs? You want to have a fight?
*  I was like, oh, are you sure? Like, you sure I'm ready?
*  And it was kind of halfway because well, I don't know if this is why he asked.
*  But once I said yes, there was a girl that used to train with us who was also doing it in my weight class.
*  And he was like, oh, this is going to be fun.
*  So, yeah, I thought it was cool that he had that confidence in me because the all the other girls who were in the tournament had been training a lot longer than me for years even.
*  So, yeah, I was just like, OK, let's let's do it. Let's see what happens.
*  Like I was scared, but I also wasn't like putting all my eggs in that basket.
*  Like I didn't think anything was going to come from doing Muay Thai.
*  It was just fun at the time.
*  So I went and I beat two girls, won the little the champ regional championship or whatever.
*  And from then on, I was just fighting.
*  They had this show in New York called Friday Night Fights.
*  And and I got a few shows on that or a few fights on that.
*  I went 14 and all as an amateur Muay Thai fighter.
*  Then when before I went pro, I was trying to get an MMA fight just so I had like one or two amateur MMA fights under my belt.
*  So if I do decide to do it, I have that experience, but no one would fight me.
*  So I ended up going pro anyway, had two pro Muay Thai fights.
*  And then I had my first pro MMA fight two days before the tough tryouts.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so recent.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  What year were you on tough?
*  That was the tough 20.
*  So I think it was 2014.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  That's when the trials were.
*  And I think it aired.
*  Yeah.
*  I think our finale was like that December.
*  Well, that makes sense now as to why you've gotten so better or so much better over the last few fights.
*  You're still fucking learning.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I shouldn't have been in there.
*  It was stupid to show up.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's not because it's interesting.
*  What was it like your first fight?
*  Because here you are, you're nine months into training, you did it for fun, and now you're really into it.
*  And then all of a sudden you're inside the ring.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  It was fun.
*  Well, it wasn't fun.
*  Fighting is never really fun.
*  I felt like it's just like this sprint.
*  Like if you ever sprinted against someone and you really want to beat them, like that's kind of what fighting feels like a lot of times is like you're just pushing yourself to like this to like total exhaustion, just trying to beat this person who's like neck and neck with you.
*  And it's just like your lungs just get tired thinking about it.
*  But yeah, it was it's a blur.
*  Like I don't really remember it.
*  But I see video and it's like super slow and sloppy.
*  But I beat the girl up.
*  I like tossed her around or whatever.
*  And yeah, it was really cool.
*  Like I think before before like they say go, I was just like, what the fuck am I doing?
*  Like, how did this happen?
*  It feels so weird the day of.
*  Yeah, I'm like, I have a BFA.
*  Like, my mom must be like, yeah, yeah, why am I doing this?
*  That's so funny.
*  What's wrong with me?
*  But like then I beat her and I was like, oh, this is cool.
*  OK, I get it.
*  I get it.
*  You know, and and it was cool because I did a couple of things that that were technical.
*  You know, I like grabbed her by the head and threw her over.
*  So that was like something we practice.
*  And yeah, I beat another girl like maybe 12 hours later in the same tournament, like those tournaments, they make you sit around forever.
*  But but then I was just like, oh, man, maybe maybe I'm pretty good at this.
*  Yeah, maybe I'll maybe I'll do it again.
*  And then so you do it a few times.
*  You get 14, you know, as an amateur.
*  At what point in time are you thinking, I think I'm going to be a professional fighter.
*  I'm still not done.
*  Really?
*  You know, like I went pro just to go pro because like if you're 14 and all as an amateur, like you're not getting fights anymore.
*  You know, like you're not booking opponents or whatever.
*  I don't want to fuck with you.
*  Yeah, they don't want to fuck with you.
*  And it's about that time anyway.
*  Like when I see guys with like 30 amateur fights, like boxing is a little different.
*  But in Muay Thai, like if you have like 30 amateur fights, it's like, come on, go pro already.
*  Like no one else is going to have that much experience.
*  And if they do, they're like about to go pro or you fought them like five times.
*  Right.
*  You know, with boxing, you have the Olympics and you have games and all these like prestigious.
*  Right.
*  Muay Thai, there's some amateur championships, but there's nothing that's going to put you in a better position as a professional.
*  Exactly.
*  With boxing, like guys like Lomachenko, who's got like 200 plus amateur fights, right?
*  Same with Gennady Golovkin.
*  Like Triple G had, I think he had around 200 plus amateur fights as well.
*  Yeah.
*  But those guys are winning world championships and fighting at the top of the heap in amateur boxing and then developing that skill.
*  So that like, I think Lomachenko won his first world title, like four fights into his pro career.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Something crazy like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't follow boxing too much, but like, yeah, I just, I just know that for sure is that like everyone who's made a name for themselves, they started off with like fucking 200, 300 fights.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah, Muay Thai, at least in the States, isn't the same.
*  So, so it was just time to make that step.
*  So I still wasn't considering that being my career of choice, especially because like Muay Thai, you don't make shit.
*  Like, what's the most money you made as a Muay Thai fighter?
*  I think I made 700 bucks on Lion Fight.
*  So that was pretty cool.
*  I was like stoked too.
*  I was like, man, I'm about to make 700 bucks.
*  I wish Lion Fight was bigger.
*  Yeah.
*  Lion Fight, it's like, I would watch Lion Fight on Access TV and I'd be like, why the fuck isn't this huge?
*  It was an awesome show.
*  It's an awesome show.
*  The commentary was great.
*  They had Pat Miletich doing commentary.
*  And if you watch the fights, they'd bring in all these ties, these world class fighters, a lot of the European guys.
*  And you're like, God damn, there's some fucking talent.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so wild to watch.
*  I love Muay Thai.
*  I love watching it.
*  I think my, I'm not sure if it was my first or I did two fights on Lion Fight.
*  So I'm not sure if it was my amateur fight or my pro fight, but one of them, I fought on the same card as Cyborg.
*  And I was like, yo, this is so cool.
*  I'm on the same card as Cyborg.
*  In Lion Fight?
*  In Lion Fight.
*  Yeah.
*  So it was the, I think she only fought once.
*  So it was Jorina Barge.
*  She fought twice.
*  She fought twice in Lion Fight?
*  Yeah.
*  First girl she destroyed.
*  I think it was maybe a French girl or something.
*  Okay.
*  But the first girl she destroyed, like I think my coach, my coach Brandon, he was holding pads for me and her coach was, oh, do you remember, people made a big deal about this.
*  The girl who got slapped in the corner in Lion Fight.
*  Oh yeah.
*  She was fighting Cyborg.
*  Her coach slapped her, right?
*  He slapped the shit out of her.
*  And it was like, ooh, cause the girl was obviously, she had taken some blows, like it's Cyborg and Cyborg went full Cyborg on her.
*  So she had already taken some blows and then she gets to the corner and the first thing the coach does is, you know, and it's like, come on, you're going to knock her out.
*  Well not only that, like, do you do that a lot?
*  Right.
*  Are you doing that when no one's around?
*  Yeah.
*  That's, you know.
*  Yeah, so it was odd.
*  It was odd.
*  Yeah.
*  But I get, I get slapping your fighter to wake them up.
*  I get a little bit, but I don't get like physically slapping them.
*  Yo, especially after they were probably concussed from the round.
*  Oh for sure.
*  You know.
*  So yeah, so that was the card that I was on.
*  Oh wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah.
*  So that was a really big deal for me.
*  So here you are, you're fighting pro as a Muay Thai fighter and then what makes you say, you know what, I think I'm going to make a leap into MMA?
*  Tough.
*  Tough.
*  Yeah.
*  So the opportunity.
*  Yeah, the opportunity because like at that time there were no, there was no strawweight weight class.
*  I was planning on being an atom weight fighter because in Muay Thai I fought between 110 and 106.
*  So I was like, oh, I could, I didn't cut weight for it.
*  I just kind of dieted down to it.
*  Does Invicta have atom weight?
*  They do.
*  They do.
*  What is the weight limit?
*  105.
*  105.
*  Yeah.
*  So Invicta has atom weight and that was kind of my plan, but I had sent like Invicta highlight rules and I didn't really get a response yet because I didn't have any MMA fights yet.
*  So that was kind of the scramble to get an MMA fight and then somehow like, you know, build up a record and get called by Invicta.
*  How long had you been training in grappling or takedown defense or MMA in general?
*  I hadn't been doing much MMA training just because in New York there wasn't a lot of it.
*  So you have like, you have like those underground MMA fights.
*  Like I had a friend who had done a couple of them.
*  It was literally like you show up, you go to like a school in the Bronx and like you're in their assembly room and there's like a ring there.
*  No ambulance.
*  Like you still have to pay like 30 bucks to get in.
*  And it's just like so hood and ratchet.
*  And like we literally saw like a kid get matched up against a little person.
*  Like a midget?
*  Yes, a midget.
*  I'm like, can we say midget?
*  My friend Brad Williams, he's a little person.
*  He says you could say it.
*  He says midget? Cool.
*  Thanks, Brad.
*  Go his way.
*  Yeah, it was a midget like literally like tried to match him up and the guy was going to knock this kid out.
*  Like it was a man, a man with man muscles.
*  But it didn't happen.
*  How old was the kid?
*  The kid, they were the same height.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  So he wasn't old.
*  That kid was a full grown kid.
*  So yeah, yeah.
*  But it didn't happen.
*  But that was the matchup.
*  So that was that was the kind of thing they were working on.
*  They were like fights of like head gear, no head gear.
*  Some people had MMA gloves.
*  Some people had boxing gloves.
*  Like it was all over the place.
*  I've seen a lot of those online.
*  Yeah.
*  Weird like sort of fucking half-assed MMA fights.
*  Yeah.
*  It didn't happen a lot in New York because that was the only MMA you could do back then.
*  Like even in a pro Muay Thai fight, you couldn't throw elbows.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, because I don't know why, but it was just it was connected to that MMA rule.
*  Could you knee?
*  You could throw knees.
*  To the head?
*  Yeah.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
*  You can clinch, you can plumb and you can still throw knees.
*  But you can throw elbows.
*  You can't throw elbows.
*  No elbows.
*  That's so silly.
*  So it was weird.
*  God, those fucking people with their rules.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so silly.
*  You had to go to jail.
*  That's so silly.
*  No, I don't.
*  But yeah, it's crazy.
*  So when I was in New York getting ready to fight MMA, I actually got a call from a coach
*  out in North Carolina.
*  And he's like, hey, if you come out here to train with me, then I'll send you to Vegas
*  to do this tryout and get you on the show.
*  And I was like, oh, OK, cool.
*  But I didn't think I was going to get on the show.
*  I was just like, oh, this would be a cool opportunity to learn some MMA.
*  So I go down to North Carolina for a few months.
*  I end up getting that fight that was like two days before.
*  It was like super like North Carolina show.
*  It was called like USFFC or something or USSFZ, one of those.
*  So I did that.
*  And I fought a girl that I was actually going to fight in atom weight, but she pulled out.
*  So we fought at straw weight.
*  I knocked her out in like the second round, I think, and then flew to Vegas the next day.
*  So yeah, it was pretty crazy.
*  But like, yeah, I still even on the flight to Vegas, I'm like, I'm not going to get on the show.
*  They got girls coming from all over the place.
*  Like they got all those girls in Invicta that I watch.
*  You know, like there's going to be like hundreds of girls here at the tryouts.
*  And like there was only like I think there's only like 30.
*  Did you have to spar at the tryouts?
*  Yeah, just grappling.
*  Just grappling.
*  Yeah. So you go to tryouts.
*  You introduce yourself.
*  Like there's like MMA media there.
*  And you tell them like your little story, try to get people behind you or whatever.
*  And then they had handpicked already like eight girls to be on the show.
*  And those are all girls that I've seen fight before.
*  So I'm like, whoa, like they're going to be on the show.
*  Like they should just put them in.
*  Like they already know what they're doing.
*  But I was like, oh, that's cool.
*  I'll just go and try out and show face and maybe Dana White will like what he sees.
*  So I was like, I'm going to go.
*  And I was like, oh, that's cool.
*  I'm going to go.
*  So that's like what I did.
*  So I went to try out.
*  I did a grappling session where I did well against the person they put me up against.
*  Like I just stayed on top of her the whole time.
*  How much grappling have you done by then?
*  Well, I have been doing grappling on and off in between like my fights.
*  But every time I got a fight, I'd stop.
*  Right.
*  For like how long have you been doing grappling?
*  How many years?
*  I'd say about maybe two years, two and a half maybe.
*  It's fairly green.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I was still a white belt.
*  Yeah.
*  Fighting in a professional organization.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It was pretty nuts.
*  And so you stay on top of this girl most of the round.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And the coach, the North Carolina coach, he was a wrestling, like straight up wrestling guy.
*  So that was kind of what I needed at the time anyway.
*  So it kind of worked out.
*  And I just like stayed on top of her in her guard and smothered her or whatever.
*  And then the part that I shined was the striking part.
*  And my coach Brandon came down with me and we did our little routine.
*  And I did like, you know, you see the ties do like the 20 kicks left, 20 kicks.
*  We did that.
*  And then I started doing like a really hard combo.
*  And I was like, making noise.
*  And they're like, Angela, stop, stop, stop.
*  I couldn't hear them over my yelling.
*  They're like, hey, hey, hey, stop.
*  You're good. You're good.
*  And I was like, oh.
*  And that was before like the before everyone else was told to stop.
*  So, so yeah.
*  And then I got like a pretty cool compliment from Dana after that.
*  He was like, I've seen a lot of tryouts and that was the best strike.
*  And I've seen any tryouts so far.
*  And I was like, whoa.
*  I mean, I'm sure he wasn't being super serious, but I took that shit to heart.
*  I was like, yo, Dana White said that.
*  Oh my God.
*  So at that point, you're thinking I might be on this fucking show.
*  I might be on the ultimate fighter.
*  A little bit, a little bit.
*  But I think I overestimated what the rest of the girls were bringing to the competition.
*  Like I thought, like everyone was showing up with like crazy records, like winning records.
*  But like at that point, like especially for a straw weight weight class,
*  like there were a lot of people just fighting whoever, whenever, just to just to make a paycheck,
*  just to like, you know, get an injury fixed or whatever.
*  So like, like, yeah, you had a lot of girls who were straw weights, but they fought at Bana weight before.
*  You know, they fought in like bars before for like a small paycheck.
*  So like you didn't really have that much like hardcore experience outside of the the official eight that were picked.
*  So, so yeah, my chances were a lot better than I had realized.
*  And even though I only had one fight, I obviously had a higher striking level than most of the girls that showed up that day.
*  So then all of a sudden you're on the ultimate fighter.
*  Yeah.
*  All told, you had been training for what? At that time, four years?
*  That is fucking bananas.
*  Right?
*  24 not done shit for all those years.
*  Now, four years later, you have a bunch of Muay Thai fights, one MMA fight.
*  You're on the ultimate fighter. Like, holy shit.
*  You're on TV. That is a four year whirlwind.
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  It's nuts.
*  Four years. That is nuts.
*  Yeah. I guess it was like going to college.
*  Only I got a job.
*  Only it was worth it.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  So then when you were on the show, how bonkers was that?
*  It was pretty nuts. I mean, I feel like I had a lot more fun than the other girls who lost.
*  Because you just enjoyed it?
*  Because I was just, yeah, I was just there for the experience.
*  Like I think coming in there, and this is kind of how I view my marriage too, is like going in there with low expectations.
*  Made it actually a lot of fun. And now I'm still married.
*  That's hilarious.
*  But yeah.
*  That's a funny way to approach it, right?
*  Because if people go crazy high with the expectations, no one's going to meet those expectations. You're going to be disappointed.
*  Exactly. I got married in City Hall. I tried out for tough after one fight and now I'm living large.
*  How are you ranked right now? What do they have you?
*  I don't know. I doubt I'm ranked.
*  You must be.
*  I've never been ranked.
*  How many girls are in the 115 pound division?
*  I don't know. I think I've fought most of them. I think I've fought about half of the top 15.
*  Yeah.
*  And the problem is I haven't beaten anyone that's ranked now.
*  So that justifies them for not putting me in the rankings.
*  I would have thought after the Cyphers fight you would get ranked.
*  I don't know. I haven't looked and I've stopped looking.
*  I think I was ranked once. I beat Marina Moros. Do you remember her? Tall, skinny girl.
*  I'm trying to remember. I have to see your name spelled out.
*  Moroz. She just moved up the flyway. She was ranked number 14. I beat her.
*  I was waiting for my ranking to pop up. I've got to get at least 15.
*  The only thing that changed was they took her off the list.
*  I was like, fuck you guys. Fucking assholes. Come on.
*  I think after that they put... Or no, I think I finally made the list. I was 15 months later.
*  But then Mackenzie Dern misweight by a gazillion pounds and knocked out fucking ABC.
*  And they were like, pluck! And took me off the rankings. So I was like, fuck those guys.
*  After that I stopped looking. And I think that was another part of that mental stress that I kept putting on myself.
*  I'm like, man, I keep losing. I'm never going to make this ranking. I'm never going to be valued as a fighter.
*  And really the only thing that the ranking does is maybe gets you a few more dollars when you re-sign your contract.
*  The rankings don't really judge that much. If I go on a five-fight win streak and I'm not ranked, it doesn't matter.
*  I'm still a contender. People are still going to be like, when is Angela going to fight the champ? She's been killing everyone.
*  So I shouldn't put too much value into it. And eventually the rank will come.
*  But at the time I was just like, man, this is stupid. They keep doing this to me. It's not like I'm getting smashed by the top girls.
*  I'm having competitive fights. The only fights that I got finished were the Rose fight where I was super green.
*  That was my third fight. She had almost won the Ultimate Fighter.
*  And then the Randa fight where I was just totally fucking myself in my own brain.
*  So aside from those two fights, I had always been competitive.
*  And I feel like even some of those I could have won if it was different judges. But the rankings never reflected that.
*  So since then I stopped. Once I realized that, I tried to stop paying attention to it just because I felt like it was affecting my own self-worth.
*  I was doubting myself as if this thing judged how good of a fighter I was.
*  Well, you're in a learning stage still. That's what's so crazy about you.
*  You've only really been doing martial arts for 10 years. That is fucking crazy.
*  Because 10 years is when it all starts coming together as a martial artist.
*  Yeah. And I think somebody told me that. I have a friend who's an actor.
*  He was actually on the same Muay Thai team that I went down to my first fight with.
*  And he's acting in LA now.
*  And when I was talking to him, he started getting some bigger gigs.
*  And I was like, man, that's really awesome that it's all coming together for you.
*  And he's like, yeah, they say it only takes 10 years.
*  10 years once you start getting your groove in any profession.
*  Yeah. Comedy the same way. That's what they say about a comedian. 10 years in, you're a real headliner.
*  Nice. So I just rounded 10 years and things just fucking fell together. Things have fallen in place.
*  The Hannah Cypress fight, I told you this online, but when I saw it, I was like, she turned a corner.
*  You see that sometimes in fighters. You see there's a moment where they break through, where it all comes together.
*  And they're putting things together in a different way. And you feel it. You feel it when you watch them.
*  You know that they've turned a corner. And that's what I thought in the Cypress fight.
*  When you were on top of her hitting her with those elbows, I was like, Jesus Christ.
*  I was like, you were so ferocious. I was like, that is someone who's turned in a corner.
*  You turned a corner. You became a finisher. And you finished two people in a row, right?
*  Yeah. And I think I was a little angry with the reception of my last finish too.
*  Just because, well, I would have been okay if the fight went on because I was surprised that they stopped it as well.
*  But you didn't think you got the props you deserved?
*  No, I didn't get the props. And I was like, all right, I got to show them. And it wasn't just that.
*  It was also, I took a peek at the scorecards after the fight and they had her winning the second round.
*  And I was like, get the fuck out of here.
*  I think two out of three judges scored the second round for her. So going into the third, it was one and one.
*  And I thought I was tooling her. But I was still like, okay, I'm still going to be aggressive.
*  I'm still going to land these elbows, this and that. But it kind of showed me like, dude, you got to finish these fights.
*  Because even though I feel like I'm winning and the punches that hit me aren't marking me, they aren't hurting me, cutting me.
*  And I can hit them and see the black eye as I bring my fist back to my face. You know what I mean?
*  You feel the difference in power. They don't see that. The judges don't see that.
*  So I feel like I have to finish fights in order to get the result that I want.
*  That's got to be so frustrating when you're fighting as a professional and the judges...
*  I mean, I say this so many times, the Houston fight was fucking bananas.
*  And I was so happy you guys went on that rant because I've been seeing it.
*  Dominic was going crazy. Dominic was so angry. He was so angry. And afterwards he was still angry.
*  He was so fucking mad. And he should be. He should be.
*  Whoever the fuck scored John Jones four rounds to one over Dominic Reyes should never score a fight again.
*  There's no way.
*  Because it's like the criteria that you use to say that he was dominant one round, you can't possibly use that for the next round.
*  It doesn't make any sense. John won for sure the last two rounds. And he might have won the third.
*  I watched that fight three times since then. I'm like, that third round is fucking close.
*  Dominic landed some real good shots, but so did John. So did John.
*  That was like right when he started slowing down, right?
*  Yup. Dominic started slowing down and John started turning it on.
*  It was somewhere around the third. It just seemed like the third is the fight. That's the round.
*  But one and two are clear Dominic Reyes. And that judge did not score the second round.
*  I think the first round he gave it to Dominic and the second round he gave it to John Jones.
*  No! You can't do that, man. You can't do that. You don't know what you're watching.
*  Well there was another judge that gave the third round to Jones.
*  One gave the second round. And I thought the second round was closer than the third.
*  The biggest robbery of the night was earlier.
*  It was Andre Yule versus Jonathan Martinez.
*  That was a fucking robbery. Ski masks, guns, duct tape.
*  Fuck you! That was a goddamn robbery. That kid won. Martinez won that fight.
*  You watch that. When they announced the decision, we were like, what the fuck is happening?
*  That was the first bad one of the night. But that was the worst one. That was the worst one of the night.
*  I thought KGB won too. I did too. That was another one, right?
*  Everybody was booing like crazy. I said it to her after the fight. I thought you won that fight.
*  She threw way more shots. It was a close fight. It was a good fight. But I thought she won that fight too.
*  It was just fucking terrible. It's crazy. It's crazy. How do you fix that?
*  You got to fix those commissions. Vegas does a real good job. They do a better job than ever.
*  They're getting better at it. But they still have judges that have no martial arts experience in Vegas.
*  They still have that. That just shouldn't take place.
*  My other fight that I'm like, fuck that. Fuck that I want it, is the Courtney Casey fight.
*  Yes, split decision. Went against you. I thought you won that fight too.
*  Thank you. Thank you. I did too.
*  That was a close fight. It was a good fight. But I thought you won that fight.
*  I don't have this conspiracy. But my husband, he went and figured out who the judges were.
*  One judge scored it 30-27 for Casey somehow. It's like, how the fuck?
*  Whenever he sees this guy's name now, he's like, oh shit. Here we go again.
*  Open scoring. We need open scoring. We need open scoring. It should be announced at the end of the round.
*  It should be announced to the audience so the audience boo's the fuck out of the judges.
*  With the judges name and a picture of their face. Yes. 100%.
*  Because I went online after the fight to try to find pictures of some of those judges from Houston.
*  And you couldn't even find their pictures. I didn't work that hard.
*  But I looked a couple of pages into Google. I bet Adam could figure it out. My husband could figure it out.
*  He's Google-foo, man. He's good at it.
*  Jamie should have a Google off. Jamie's the Google master.
*  Ready, set, go. Find the judges. Screwed me over.
*  There's some people that shouldn't be doing it. And I think there should be more judges.
*  I think three is crazy. Glory has five for kickboxing.
*  And I think five is a good number. It's a better number. Six is probably even better.
*  Eight is the octagon. We have one for each panel.
*  How about eight? Yes. How about that? That's not a bad idea. That is not a bad idea.
*  One for each panel is actually a very good idea.
*  I definitely see a different fight from being there live and then watching it on camera.
*  I see a totally different fight.
*  Sometimes even watching when I'm at the cage, I want to see it in person.
*  But sometimes I've got to look at the monitor. And then I look at the monitor, it looks clearer.
*  I see things that I'm not seeing just looking through the cage.
*  And for a long time, judges didn't even have monitors.
*  Now at least they have monitors. But I think you're right. I think eight is the magic number.
*  It's not like they pay those people a fuckload of money.
*  Just fucking do it. You definitely need more voices.
*  Because when you have something like a decision, like the John Jones fight with Dominic Reyes.
*  I'm not against the decision. It's not a robbery.
*  I could see an argument that Dominic Reyes won the fight.
*  I like John getting the decision because I like the guy who wins the last rounds more.
*  I think it means more. Because if they're fighting to the death, I have all my money on John Jones.
*  Because John Jones is dominating the fourth, dominating the fifth. That's a ten round fight.
*  I don't think Dominic Reyes is going to make it. I don't think he's going to make it.
*  And that means something. That means something.
*  Because a fight, it is a game, right? It is a sport. You're scoring.
*  And the score should count. But I think the last round should count more.
*  That's how Pride used to do it. They used to judge the fight overall.
*  They did that in Muay Thai too, like traditional Thai rules.
*  They dance. Or no, not dance. They fill out the first round and they fight the second and third round.
*  And then the fourth round, I guess, decides who wins.
*  And then the fifth round is just a dance.
*  Really? That's a lot because it's gambling and then they fight every weekend too, right?
*  Yeah, exactly. So they're like, hey, I lost. So let's just dance it out.
*  And if they really want it, they'll still try to get a knockout the fifth round. But usually it's just dance.
*  We have to do something. We have to do something.
*  When you get to a place like Houston, and look, I love Texas. I love going there. I love the people.
*  I really love Texas. But that was an embarrassment.
*  And there's no way that that should be a place where you have world title fights.
*  There's no way. Unless they fix something. There's no way.
*  I mean, can you imagine?
*  I was surprised it wasn't in Vegas.
*  Well, they needed a good card for Houston.
*  I mean, it was packed. Crowd was amazing. It was great.
*  It was just marred by bad judges.
*  I got to go to that one. But yeah, definitely a weird night.
*  So are you leaving from here straight to the airport and going to New Zealand?
*  What does that fly? Does it take three years? How long does it take to get there?
*  It's going to feel like it. It's like, I think it's 15 hours.
*  15 fucking hours.
*  So yeah.
*  Are you worried about coronavirus and shit when you fly?
*  Yes.
*  It kind of has to be, right?
*  I mean, I'm less worried about it than Adam.
*  He's like the worrywart of the two of us.
*  So I'm kind of like, I'll be fine, you know, whatever.
*  But it's definitely like a thing that I should be worried about.
*  I think it just showed up in San Diego last week or something.
*  Two people had it in San Diego.
*  And now that they're testing for, they're using a different test to detect it.
*  They're getting even more cases of it.
*  So scary.
*  You know where it came from?
*  I was just listening to a podcast.
*  Yeah. My friend Ryan Callahan's podcast today, they were talking about it came from people eating weird animals from a marketplace like bats and snakes and shit.
*  No.
*  Bro in China, they eat whatever the fuck they can get a hold of sometimes.
*  Yeah.
*  There was this one lady who got arrested and she's got arrested for serving or selling all these different animals.
*  She was selling eagles.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  People get weird about eagles, but we don't give a fuck about a chicken.
*  I don't know.
*  They're so noble.
*  They're big.
*  They're big as shit.
*  They're big as shit.
*  I feel bad when it's bigger than normal.
*  Like a really big...
*  Like an elephant.
*  Yeah.
*  Like a really big elephant, I feel really bad about eating just because I feel like its brain is bigger.
*  So it's probably more likely to be sentient.
*  I'd have to be starving to death to eat an elephant.
*  Yeah.
*  It'd have to be like I'm trapped in the bush and I got a rifle.
*  I would never eat an elephant.
*  Like an elephant, like just an elephant, they're so amazing.
*  They have incredible memories too.
*  Yeah.
*  There's this crazy video of an elephant being reunited with I think it's a sibling or a daughter or mother or something like that.
*  And they hadn't seen each other in 12 years.
*  And they see each other and they run to each other and wrap their trunks around each other.
*  It's crazy.
*  Like they're not...
*  That is not like a deer.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, deer don't even know what the fuck's going on.
*  They're like, you know, is that a car?
*  Let me run in front of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh shit.
*  Elephants, they can teach elephants to paint themselves.
*  Have you ever seen that?
*  No.
*  Dude, you gotta see this.
*  Elephants can paint themselves.
*  They can paint an elephant.
*  Yeah.
*  Like just with them holding onto the brush with their trunk, they make a trunk, they make the body, they make the tail.
*  It's crazy.
*  That's so cool.
*  They trained an elephant to paint himself.
*  That's so crazy.
*  It's so weird to watch.
*  So they could be smarter than apes then, right?
*  Or is it just different?
*  The thing is, the thing where it's hard to tell is like apes have fingers, right?
*  They can move stuff around.
*  Like chimps have incredible memories.
*  They have incredible short-term memories.
*  Like chimps have better memories than us when it comes to like they'll flash a bunch of things on a screen and chimps can point out exactly what they saw if they get a reward.
*  Like if they get candy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like they'll give them candy if they can lay out like some numbers and some things like in the correct order.
*  Where you or I would be like, what the fuck did I see?
*  I don't remember.
*  Yeah.
*  Like we're burdened by too much information and data and all sorts of different things.
*  Chimps can just do it.
*  And they have that one motivator.
*  Yeah.
*  They want that candy.
*  But their memory is incredible.
*  That's crazy.
*  Chimps have bananas, memories.
*  That's cool.
*  For lack of a better term.
*  Did you find that video of the elephant with the brush?
*  It's so weird to watch.
*  I mean, apparently this is like they train this elephant specifically to learn how to do this, but it's still crazy impressive.
*  Because he does a really good job.
*  Like better than like a four-year-old would.
*  Like a four-year-old person.
*  Like, you know, one of my kids in their four, they wouldn't do as good a job of making a fucking elephant.
*  Did it look in the mirror?
*  I don't remember what it did.
*  It was a self-portrait.
*  Right.
*  How does it know?
*  You got it, Chimmy?
*  I'm trying to find the exact one you're talking about.
*  This has been a controversial story, I believe.
*  Right.
*  It is.
*  Well, I think it's controversial because they taught the elephant how to paint himself.
*  But it's still.
*  So the training methods are probably controversial.
*  I don't think it's like.
*  I don't think they abused him.
*  I don't think they're thinking.
*  Is that what they're thinking?
*  That's, I mean, I'm looking at the heart of the video and that's what's coming up is like abuse or not abuse.
*  Yeah, but that's animal rights dipshits.
*  Those people get fucking crazy.
*  I do feel really guilty about when I went to Thailand just to like train out there and I did one of those like elephant ride.
*  I did too.
*  And I do feel guilty about it.
*  Me too.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm glad you did.
*  My whole family was like, that was so fun.
*  I was like, I'm not doing that again.
*  Yeah.
*  I felt bad.
*  I mean, you feed the elephant.
*  Here it is.
*  So here it is.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this elephant.
*  He's painting himself.
*  It's a baby.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, he's, I don't know how you could say he's being abused.
*  I mean, he's just doing that.
*  It doesn't seem like there's any weird motivators other than, you know, they taught him how to do it.
*  They probably gave him some treats.
*  No, he's drawing a trunk.
*  Yeah.
*  What the hell?
*  No, I mean, they're all drawing themselves.
*  What?
*  There's more than one.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, he's drawing a duck.
*  That's crazy.
*  But just the fact that they can do that, that they can create something.
*  And it reasonably resembles what they are.
*  It's nuts.
*  What they're making.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm glad you said that about-
*  I thought he had like maybe a mirror in front of him.
*  Yeah.
*  No, he didn't have a mirror.
*  He's like doing like a Van Gogh or something.
*  It's pretty close to what an elephant looks like.
*  It says the truth about elephant paintings.
*  What is the truth?
*  Well, it must be like a stencil that they had.
*  They're just like tracing it or whatever.
*  Not tracing that, but like they must have trained them to make a certain shape.
*  So I doubt that the elephant knows that that's him.
*  I wonder.
*  But who knows?
*  Who knows?
*  They could be smarter than all of us.
*  Don't they say like fucking, what is it?
*  What is it?
*  Squid?
*  Octopus and squid.
*  Yeah, they're really stupid smart.
*  Really smart.
*  But they only live for like-
*  A couple weeks.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like how the fuck does that work?
*  Yeah, I think octopus lived like two years or something stupid.
*  That's so crazy.
*  But I'm glad you said that about the elephants in Thailand.
*  I felt bad.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't like the riding them thing, but you fed them.
*  We get to feed them sugar cane.
*  Yeah, that was the best part.
*  Were you near Chiang Mai?
*  No, I didn't get to go to any sanctuary, like the elephant sanctuary where you get to like bathe them.
*  Yeah, that's what we did.
*  Just run around with them.
*  Yeah, you clean them and then you feed them sugar cane.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you ride them.
*  And with the riding part, I was like, I don't want to do that.
*  I felt-
*  Did they have that big hook?
*  The hook?
*  When they- so when we went to the one that we went to, they have this like big pole with a little hook on the end.
*  And it never like hits them or anything, but it's just resting on like their shoulder.
*  No, they didn't have that.
*  They just had a rope.
*  That was like their like kind of training tool.
*  Oh, punish them?
*  I figured like that was what they used to like get them to behave.
*  So it's like someone sitting next to you with like a whip, you know?
*  Oh, no.
*  Like you know what it could do.
*  They don't do anything, but you just know it's there.
*  No, this place, one thing that I will definitely say is that they treated those elephants like pets.
*  They treated them really well.
*  They pet them.
*  And you could tell they had a sweet relationship with them.
*  Like the elephant would wrap their trunk around the people and the people would rub their head.
*  They wanted to be around those people.
*  And then they would feed them a lot of sugar cane.
*  Like we had these big stalks of sugar cane and they would make you-
*  See, the whole idea was a rehabilitation thing for elephants.
*  And a lot of the elephants had been in circuses and zoos and things like that.
*  And then they actually had reintroduced a lot of them to the wild.
*  And when we were there, these elephants were not in cages.
*  They were free roaming.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  And they were crazy.
*  Their power.
*  They just go wrap their trunk around shit.
*  Just pull it out of the roots and then just start eating it.
*  But then they're also really gentle.
*  Really gentle people.
*  Like when they grab stuff out of your hand.
*  It's just like they just like they feel your hand and then they grab the treat around it.
*  And it's just like what?
*  How are they so precise?
*  I know.
*  They're fucking smart.
*  Yeah, they're smart as shit.
*  They can bring those elephants back to a place where they can exist in the wild.
*  Because they basically eat everything that's in the jungle.
*  They just grab it and eat it.
*  They know what to do.
*  So while we were hanging out with them, they're just pulling trees out of the roots and just eating them right there.
*  But their disposition is so interesting.
*  It's just so interesting to be around them.
*  Just big and gentle.
*  Big and gentle.
*  I mean, they're so fucking big.
*  And they help you get up on them.
*  They lift their leg up and you stand on their leg.
*  And then you pull yourself up onto their back and then you hang onto this rope that's around them.
*  They didn't seem to mind that you were on their back.
*  But still, it felt like I would rather just feed them and pet them.
*  Yeah, like they're not going to do that in the wild.
*  They're not going to be like, hey, buddy.
*  Yeah.
*  Then they go down to this pond and then you wash them in the pond and everything.
*  It's interesting.
*  That one was really cool.
*  I wanted to go up to Chiang Mai, but we were at this place called...
*  There it is right there.
*  That's exactly where we were.
*  Ah, that's so pretty.
*  Yeah, that's exactly where we were.
*  That's awesome.
*  And so you go out there and you pet them.
*  They love it.
*  They're like, oh, you're giving us a bath.
*  That's where you see all the cute baby elephants, frolicing.
*  Oh, there it is.
*  Oh my God.
*  They love the baths too.
*  Oh my God.
*  But that water is filled with shit.
*  They just shit in the water while you're out there.
*  Would you really mind though?
*  It's elephant shit.
*  It's not that bad.
*  It's just leaves.
*  It's probably lucky in some cultures.
*  I'm sure it is.
*  Just put it on your nose.
*  I went to a wolf sanctuary this past weekend.
*  Not this past weekend.
*  What's today?
*  I went Friday.
*  Yeah, Friday.
*  Yeah.
*  Is that nearby?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's depressing.
*  It's depressing.
*  Oh, really?
*  Well, they all are abused, but being rehabilitated or something?
*  No, no, they're not abused, but they're contained.
*  That's what's depressing.
*  Most of them came from people wanting a wolf from a pet for a pet.
*  They're like, oh, I'm going to have a wolf.
*  I'll be a badass.
*  And then it just rips your house apart and doesn't listen to you at all.
*  And you realize, oh my God, this isn't a dog.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's a fucking wolf.
*  It started off so well when you were a puppy.
*  Some of them are so big.
*  But to me, what was depressing was, first of all, they neuter them.
*  When they get in there, they kind of have to because they don't want them to breed
*  because then they'll create more of the same situation.
*  But then the other thing is that they're in this pen.
*  And then they don't get to be free.
*  So it's not like a big area?
*  No, the pen they were in is not as big as the studio.
*  It's not that big for a fucking wolf.
*  Wolves want to run and hunt.
*  That's what they want to do.
*  They want to hunt.
*  So they never re-released them into the wild or anything?
*  No, I mean, listen to this, though.
*  Listen to how...
*  That's when we were leaving.
*  We were leaving, they were howling.
*  They wanted you to come back.
*  Well, we went into the pens.
*  See how little the pens are, though?
*  Yeah.
*  We went into the pens and pet them.
*  Like, these people, they are amazing.
*  And they're doing an amazing job.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, they're keeping these animals alive and they're feeding them and they do love
*  them and they go in there and take care of them and pet them.
*  But to me, it's like, that's a fucking wolf.
*  That wolf should be in the studio.
*  That's a fucking wolf.
*  That's a fucking wolf.
*  To me, it's like, that's a fucking wolf.
*  That wolf should be on a mountain somewhere.
*  It should be chasing down a deer.
*  It shouldn't be living like that.
*  It's so pretty, man.
*  They're beautiful.
*  It just bummed me out.
*  It made me feel like I went to a prison.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You know?
*  Like, these are incredible animals and they're...
*  The only way they can keep them is to...
*  That's Forest Glant, who's a wildlife biologist who's been on the podcast for...
*  I'm getting kissed right there by a wolf.
*  They're very sweet.
*  They're very sweet.
*  Like, you can...
*  Some of them, you can pet and hug them and hang on to them and they like you.
*  They like people, but they're fucking wolves.
*  You're not telling them shit.
*  There's no sit, lie down, fuck you.
*  They're wolves.
*  Well, that's good that they have somewhere to, I don't know, I guess...
*  They stay alive.
*  ...rescue them from people who would have just put them down themselves.
*  They would have put them down.
*  You know?
*  And that is a lot of what they did.
*  They did keep a lot of them from being put down.
*  But I left there feeling really depressed.
*  Isn't that how that...
*  I forget what his name is, but he has a huge Instagram and he has all the big cats.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Fuck, what is his name?
*  What is it called?
*  Yeah, I can't think of it, but it's like something...
*  Cat something, big cat something.
*  I probably didn't even say that, but that's what I'm like, ooh, big cat videos.
*  But yeah, the guy goes in and he cuddles with them.
*  And it's always like someone who had a pet tiger who was like, this is going to be cool.
*  And then it wasn't.
*  It's mostly people in Texas.
*  Yeah, I bet.
*  You know, there's more tigers in captivity in Texas in people's backyards than there are in all the wild of the world.
*  Are there...what?
*  Are there like no laws or something with like animal stuff?
*  Texas doesn't give a fuck.
*  You want a giraffe?
*  Go get yourself a giraffe.
*  Oh my God.
*  You can just have a tiger.
*  That might be fun, get a giraffe.
*  I feel like a giraffe would be more chill of like staying in a small estate.
*  Oh, they're so chill.
*  Yeah, they're just like, yeah, give me leaves.
*  Well, they're so chill.
*  I used to have a bit about them, like they're the only animals that I don't feel bad for at the zoo
*  because they're walking around the zoo like, another day with no lions.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And they're just wandering around, oh, lions majestic.
*  It's just a random account.
*  I was trying to find this out.
*  Yeah, no, that's not it.
*  Oh, no, it's called black jaguar something.
*  Yeah, black jaguar something.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
*  But yeah, it's a lot like that.
*  Black jaguar something.
*  It's not black jaguar, white tiger.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm not sure where it is, but yeah.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  There it is.
*  Black jaguar, white tiger.
*  Yeah, he's just cuddling tigers and shit.
*  Yeah, try to look it up.
*  Oh, he's in Mexico?
*  We rescued animals born and sold in Mexico from horrible circumstances.
*  The most depressing shit I ever saw for sure was a tiger sanctuary in Thailand.
*  Oh.
*  It was so depressing because they were all drugged.
*  Because you could take a picture with a tiger.
*  The tigers landed like this, like just like a drug prostitute in a room.
*  Yeah.
*  Poor thing.
*  And people like smiling and taking pictures.
*  And I said, I am not going in that fucking cage.
*  I'm not taking part of it.
*  Like we thought it was just a tiger sanctuary.
*  You rescue tigers, you go look at tigers.
*  I'm like, be cool for my kids to see some tigers.
*  But then we got there, I'm like, oh, no, these people are getting.
*  And there's a difference because like they have little cubs.
*  And so you go in a room, there's a pen.
*  And these are like little cubs.
*  They're tiny.
*  They're only a couple of weeks old or, you know, four or five weeks old.
*  Whatever it is, they can be around people, six weeks old.
*  And you could play with them, but they're super energetic.
*  They're jumping on you and they're swatting things.
*  They're playing with each other and rolling around.
*  And then as they get older, it gets to a year or two and then they stop.
*  They stop being natural.
*  Then they're all drugged.
*  So you could be around the littler tigers.
*  And there's a bunch of handlers around and everybody's real nervous.
*  They keep the tigers away from you.
*  The tigers away from you and the tigers are looking at you, but they're there.
*  They're kind of.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're only like a year old.
*  Then you get to the full grown tigers and they're just fucked up.
*  They're all drugged.
*  They're all drugged.
*  That's crazy.
*  And I guess that's like, that's like my brain never thought of like, oh, yeah,
*  they must be drugged in order to be sitting in a room with strangers and not
*  freaking out.
*  Like I never thought about it.
*  You could tell.
*  Yeah, that makes so much sense.
*  Have you ever had one of these CBD killcliffs?
*  No.
*  Is it a USADA approved?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's just CBD.
*  I'm addicted to these though.
*  These are killcliffs.
*  Like overkill.
*  Pretty good.
*  Yeah, that's pretty good.
*  25 milligrams.
*  But if you go into that room and the cage rather and see the tigers, you know right
*  away they're drugged.
*  Because they're just laying there like.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That's a nice thing with that black jaguar tiger guy.
*  Like you always see the tigers are like playing with them.
*  They're like swatting them around like the kittens you're talking about.
*  And like you can see like their claws are like retracted.
*  So like they actually like the guy.
*  They're just having fun.
*  Yeah, they could tear him apart at any point, but they're still like nibbling on
*  him and stuff.
*  It's just like, dude, that guy is crazy.
*  He's like like the big cat Steve Irwin, I guess.
*  Yeah, he's nuts.
*  There's a few of those guys.
*  There's a guy in Texas that does that.
*  No kidding.
*  Another one in Texas.
*  But he's got a tiger rehabilitation place.
*  It's the same kind of deal.
*  Like wrestles with these tigers and plays with them and shit.
*  And you're like, this is not going to end well, bro.
*  Did you watch Siegfried and Roy?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  A lot of times they just decide to go tiger on you.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it's like, bye tiger.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Poor things.
*  Yeah.
*  The wolf thing was a real bummer.
*  I didn't think it was going to bum me out as much, but it bummed me out.
*  I mean, I'm happy that those people are doing it.
*  And then I think what they're doing is amazing.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  But for me, just the feeling of being around that thing, like, oh, that thing wants to
*  run.
*  Yeah.
*  That thing wants to open that gate.
*  That's like your animal, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Like wolves.
*  You're like big on wolves.
*  Did you see, what was that movie at the very end?
*  He goes once more into the fray.
*  Oh, was that William Neeson?
*  Yeah.
*  The gray.
*  Yeah.
*  The gray.
*  The gray.
*  That was a good one.
*  I have a friend of mine who shot an elk in Alberta and the elk, he didn't know it, but
*  the elk, when they shot it with a bow and arrow, the elk ran and died and they were
*  trying to pack the elk out and these wolves started circling them.
*  They didn't realize they were in a wolf's den.
*  Oh.
*  They shot the elk and the elk literally died right outside the wolf's den.
*  And the wolves decided to claim the elk.
*  So they're circling them.
*  And they shot three of them as they ran at them.
*  Damn.
*  Wild big wolves.
*  And they were big, right?
*  Big wolves.
*  Like real 125 pound wolves.
*  Damn.
*  Yes.
*  That's like what I walk at.
*  Yeah.
*  You can find the video, John Dudley, who's a good friend of mine, who was on the podcast
*  talking about it.
*  But he only had three arrows left and his friend only had three bullets.
*  So they're standing there with their back to a tree and they got like fucking 20 wolves
*  around them.
*  It's crazy.
*  That's so cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  To live, to live and tell that story is fucking awesome.
*  But to be in it like a kid.
*  Well, he's got the skulls of the wolves.
*  Oh my God.
*  I have one of them on my desk at home.
*  So did they just back off after they took out of view?
*  Yeah.
*  Once they realized that they killed three of them, the wolves were like, okay, this
*  is not good.
*  They wanted that elk.
*  Yeah.
*  Did they leave the elk at least?
*  No, they didn't leave the elk.
*  They took it.
*  They're like, fuck you wolves.
*  Fuck you wolves.
*  Superior fucking species.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  The wolves didn't know that my friend John was down to one arrow because he killed two
*  with his bow and the other guy is down to like two bullets.
*  Damn.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah, that's crazy.
*  So lucky, man.
*  Well, those animals used to kill everybody.
*  That's what Little Red Riding Hood was all about.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know there was a ceasefire in World War I because they were fighting in Russia.
*  The Germans and the Russians were fighting and there were so many people were getting
*  killed by wolves that they decided to have a ceasefire.
*  Because the wolves in Russia are just fucking ruthless.
*  Is that like when it was snowing and stuff?
*  Yeah.
*  And the wolves were eating the soldiers.
*  Damn.
*  They were killing soldiers that were on patrol and they were also like when everyone and
*  somebody got wounded and they were on the battlefield, they would just get torn apart
*  by wolves in front of everybody.
*  Man, that would make a great movie.
*  Yeah, it would make a great movie.
*  So they had a shared communication back and forth between, I'm pretty sure it was the
*  Germans and the Russians.
*  And they said, let's just kill some wolves for a while.
*  And so they had a ceasefire.
*  They killed wolves and they went back to killing each other.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  Like whew.
*  Fucking history is no joke.
*  That's nuts.
*  So back to fighting.
*  Speaking of caged wolves.
*  How much do you walk around at?
*  How much do you walk around at?
*  I don't walk that heavy.
*  Like I tried to like stay above 30, 130.
*  But usually it doesn't happen.
*  So I'll be between like 130, 125.
*  So you only have to cut 10.
*  Yeah, I only have to cut 10.
*  Like I've never been a big straw weight.
*  And what do you weigh right now?
*  Probably like 125.
*  And so you're fighting this weekend?
*  Yeah, I'm fighting this weekend.
*  So how do you do taper off or do you just cut the water?
*  I taper off this week.
*  So I was eating like pasta for dinner, like all the way up until this morning.
*  So like that's how I keep my weight on because otherwise like my metabolism just from training
*  and running like I'll be at like 120 without even trying.
*  So if Adam weight was a weight class, you would go there?
*  Well that's the thing.
*  Like it's such a big jump.
*  So it's a weird one for me because like 110 is probably like my healthiest weight class.
*  105 I start to look crazy.
*  Like that's what like Skeletor like.
*  Like I posted a video recently and it was from like somebody was following me before
*  one of my Muay Thai fights.
*  And dude I look so crazy.
*  Like I look like straight up like.
*  Is it on your Instagram?
*  Yeah, yeah it's on my Instagram.
*  But I think you can see just like my cheekbones.
*  It's just like a still of me throwing a kick.
*  But like my cheekbones are so sunken in.
*  There it is right there.
*  Yeah, like you can see it.
*  Like I look like my weigh in.
*  I was probably about 113 right there.
*  So you're really dieting hard.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Like I'm on my like calorie counter.
*  I'm making sure I'm not eating carbs after six.
*  You know like carbs after sundown.
*  That was the rule.
*  Like no carbs after sundown.
*  It's got to be harder for women, right?
*  Well, I mean.
*  Because women want to, your body wants to hold more body fat than a man's.
*  I've never had a problem cutting weight.
*  Like I've always been okay.
*  Like I think I just never tried to cut too much.
*  Like I think if I was bigger, then it would be an issue.
*  Like a lot of girls, they see who's cutting weight and how big they get.
*  And then they get scared.
*  So they try to go down a weight class below them.
*  And so like, I mean, if you look at Amanda Nunes, she doesn't, she isn't really the
*  biggest bantam weight.
*  You know, like she's kind of a natural bantam weight.
*  Like she looks about the same size as Nina Ansarov.
*  So it's like.
*  You think so?
*  I think so.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, I think she's a little bit smaller in like fight camp.
*  Or when I see them both outside of fight camp, they look about like the same size.
*  I disagree.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I think Amanda looks thick.
*  Her shoulders.
*  Yeah, she's kind of like wide.
*  But she's all shoulders.
*  Like her waist is small.
*  Like she's not like, I don't know, she's not like built up.
*  Right.
*  She's not like muscular.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  She's just, she's just a little broad.
*  But like she's, she's.
*  It's not like cyborg.
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
*  She's not like cutting like to the point where she looks like she's about to die.
*  Yeah.
*  But she's still a world beater.
*  So like it's kind of, it's kind of cool to see that.
*  And I think a lot of people perform better when they're not cutting a ton of weight.
*  Just, just because like you're in there more natural.
*  You're moving the same way you move in training.
*  Whereas if you cut like a shit ton of weight, you're like kind of half cocked.
*  You know, like you're, you're already like depleted and your brain's not as healthy.
*  You don't have as much water in there.
*  You're just weaker.
*  Yeah.
*  You're just weaker all around.
*  There's, there's a point of diminishing returns, right?
*  Where you just cut too much.
*  If you cut a little bit, you're probably pretty good.
*  But like a lot of people became who they really should have been once they moved up in weight,
*  like Masvidal or Dustin Poirier.
*  Like Dustin Poirier just couldn't make 45 anymore.
*  Now he's having a hard time making 55.
*  He's so big, he might have to move up to 70.
*  Yeah.
*  And your body just like kind of fights against you.
*  Like once you had all those like really tough weight cuts.
*  And that's why I'm not like super on that.
*  Like, oh, I'm gonna go to 105 train.
*  Like I might try it once.
*  I feel like everyone gets like one missed.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  If it existed, like I might try once and if I miss it, I'd be like, all right, not gonna
*  do that again.
*  You know?
*  But that's got to be hard too, to go through the camp, like diminishing yourself in camp.
*  Yeah.
*  Like TJ Dillshaw is the worst example, right?
*  When he went down to 125, he looked horrific.
*  And that's what I would look like.
*  Like I look like all skin and bones and like muscles, you know?
*  And like it's like scary.
*  But at the same time, when I did do it, which granted was about eight years ago, when I
*  did do it, I only dieted.
*  Like I didn't know anything about like water cuts or like, you know, I didn't do hot baths
*  or anything like that.
*  I would just diet down to about 112 and then not eat anything the next day.
*  And that was me making weight.
*  I really wish there was more weight classes in MMA.
*  Yeah.
*  Women's MMA and men's MMA.
*  At least with women's, it's now 10 pound increments.
*  Yeah, it was insane when it was just 135 and 115.
*  Crazy.
*  You had people killing themselves trying to make 115.
*  That's such a giant gap with women.
*  Yeah.
*  20 pound gap is huge.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the girls are so much bigger at 135, like crazy big.
*  Like Kat Zagano was at Alliance for a little bit.
*  And when she wasn't at weight, I was just like, dude, like there's no reason I should
*  be training with you right now.
*  She's a strong girl.
*  Like you're just fucking bullying me around.
*  She's just tossing me like a little racco.
*  She's in her 60s, right?
*  When she's not training.
*  I'm not sure.
*  She's got to get close to 160.
*  I'm not sure.
*  She's a large lady.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean that in a good way.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just not fat.
*  In charge.
*  Yeah.
*  She's fucking strong as shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  She's an athlete, man.
*  She's an athlete.
*  Big athlete.
*  Yeah.
*  Just tough.
*  And then Amanda had her really rocked in that first round and then she came back to stop
*  her.
*  Yeah, that was amazing.
*  To this day, when she won that fight and screamed, poof, it just gives you chills.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like one of the most primal.
*  That blood curdling like Conan.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that was just like from her bones.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that's mad.
*  After she won and she went through hell in that first round.
*  That fight fucked her up for a long time.
*  Yeah.
*  She was talking about it on the podcast.
*  She got brain damage from that fight.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  She's still recovering from it.
*  That is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Amanda Nunes is a freak.
*  She's a monster.
*  She's a freak.
*  She should be put in jail for what she's done.
*  He's toilet-limit.
*  Well, when she clipped Cyborg, you could see Cyborg going, what the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Because like I said, it doesn't look like she hits that hard.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  She hits so hard.
*  And then she hits and then it lands.
*  It's just like, whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  She's got something going on.
*  It's crazy how some people just have this weird power edge.
*  They got that touch.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Deontay Wilder.
*  He's the best example of it.
*  It's like, what the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  Alex Pereira.
*  You know Alex Pereira in Glory?
*  No.
*  He's the only guy that's knocked out Israel Adesanya.
*  Oh.
*  Knocked him out in a kickboxing fight.
*  He's a fucking freak.
*  It's the same thing.
*  With a punch or?
*  He knocked him out with a left hook.
*  Yeah.
*  Nice.
*  One punch.
*  Boom.
*  Flatlined him.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  He hits so fucking hard.
*  He knocks out everybody.
*  He's a weird guy.
*  Where, you know, sometimes people just have this power.
*  This weird freaky power.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm still hopeful that like that's going to be me eventually because like, you know,
*  Amanda Nunes didn't really do that for a long time.
*  And then after that cat fight, I think after the Shevchenko, the first Shevchenko fight,
*  she just started finding her groove and finding that money mark.
*  And then like the rest is-
*  Her timing got much better.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it just really took her training far more seriously and invested much more
*  time in her strength and conditioning.
*  Oh, okay.
*  That's a big factor because Amanda would get tired.
*  And that's what happened in the cat-singano fight.
*  She had cat-singano really badly hurt in the first round, but then cat just so tough, she
*  came back in the second and then wound up stopping her.
*  Same with the first Shevchenko fight too.
*  I think that's why the rematch happened because Valentina just had a really strong last round
*  against her.
*  Same thing.
*  So she nipped that in the butt.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's interesting how like you need weight classes, you need those increments because
*  Valentina won 25 is just a fucking monster.
*  Yeah.
*  She's a monster.
*  Yeah.
*  She's so good.
*  It's such a huge gap too.
*  Yeah.
*  It's such a huge gap between like, I don't know, a number one contender and champ.
*  It doesn't even make sense.
*  It's crazy.
*  That fight, I did my best to pump up Kaitlyn Chuukagian and to make it seem like it's going
*  to be a good fight.
*  But all I could think of is like, how is this girl going to beat her?
*  Yeah.
*  How are you going to beat her?
*  She does everything perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought like numbers, like if you're going just like volume, you know, I thought that
*  Kaitlyn could like, you know, close the gap a bit.
*  I didn't think so.
*  This is why, because Kaitlyn, she uses points, she scores well, but she very rarely knocks
*  people out.
*  Like she knocked down Liz Carmouche with a head kick.
*  Right.
*  But Liz survived and won the decision.
*  Right.
*  Like Valentina makes you pay.
*  She makes you pay.
*  So like all those like shots that she would throw the volume, it's different because you
*  put the shots out there and then BOP!
*  And it comes back at you just like, whoa, those kicks come back at you and you're like,
*  fuck.
*  Elbow comes back and you're like, whoa.
*  So now you're like, now everything's more at a distance and you lose your ability to
*  engage.
*  You get nervous because every time you engage, she's looking to take your fucking head off.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Especially after that Jessica I fight.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  That was crazy.
*  I think that's the one that made me a fan because I was hating for a while.
*  I was like, she ain't that good.
*  She just hasn't fought anyone yet.
*  She beat up that poor girl that, uh, uh.
*  Oh, the Brazilian girl?
*  I think she's fighting.
*  Is she the, no, she's not fighting in Auckland, right?
*  I do not know.
*  I don't know if she's on that card.
*  But I don't remember her name.
*  They should have stopped that fight way, way, way before that.
*  They shouldn't have made that fight.
*  Like that, I was just like, come on guys.
*  They shouldn't have made that fight.
*  That's just mean.
*  But like after that, I was just like, man, y'all like giving her all these props for
*  destroying this poor girl.
*  And like she shouldn't have been in there against anyone.
*  But then after the Jessica I fight, I was like, yo, she's got something.
*  Like that lady's scary.
*  She is a dominant.
*  Yeah.
*  She's going to be a dominant champ.
*  She's just a scary person.
*  She went down to the range in Texas and the guys who run the range were like, the way
*  that lady shoots, she shoots like a fucking special ops soldier.
*  We haven't seen someone come in here and shoot that good unless they're a CEO or a competitive
*  shooter.
*  Oh my God.
*  She's a fucking straight up killer all around.
*  Someone stop talking shit about her dancing.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, you got to see her groups, like the groups.
*  She was like pistol groups, like tap, tap, tap.
*  Everything's in the heart.
*  Wow.
*  Like she's, she's, she's a special hard lady.
*  You should take her hunting with you.
*  Oh, she probably would fucking jump on something's back and strangle it.
*  She's a, she's a hard lady.
*  But it's, it's people like that that make the rest of the division rise up.
*  Right?
*  Like remember when Anderson Silva was just dominating everybody in 185 and it was like,
*  who the fuck could beat that guy?
*  It took someone like that to be that, that unstoppable force at the top of the mountain
*  that made all the rest of the division rise up.
*  And then as Anderson got a little older and you know, those guys got better and Chris
*  Wyman went up beating them.
*  And then the division comes alive.
*  Just got mixed up.
*  And yeah, it's exciting again.
*  Now it's just chaos and Robert Whitaker and now Adesanya and Yoel Romero is going to fight
*  Adesanya in a couple of weeks.
*  I can't wait.
*  Woo.
*  Like, let me hurry up and get my fight out the way so I can like be a fan again, you
*  know?
*  That fight's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, the dance off was so sick.
*  I know like right in front of Dana does a back flip and almost kicks Dana in the head.
*  I'm like, I don't even think Dana saw what happened right there.
*  Like how close is like they did in slow motion.
*  You can see his face like Yoel had already flipped and then he's like, yeah, he just
*  probably saw a foot out of his peripheral.
*  Like what is happening?
*  Yoel is such a freak.
*  He's insane.
*  That's another thing that gives me hope because I like I've always been self-conscious about
*  my age too.
*  Like I think that started later.
*  Yeah.
*  It started at 24.
*  I used to call it my like quarter life crisis thing.
*  The fact that I just like started fighting out of nowhere.
*  But but yeah, I've always been a little self-conscious, especially because like a lot of times like
*  the UFC will hype up like a young fighter like she's only 18.
*  She's the youngest fighter on the card.
*  And then like I'll see someone like Alex Chamber fight and they go the oldest fighter on the
*  card is just like, why you gotta put her out there like that?
*  I've always been a little self-conscious like man, like I feel like I have an expiration
*  date.
*  But then the long the more I pay attention, the more I realized that a lot of the fighters
*  I do look up to are like my age or older.
*  So yeah, I stopped looking at it that way.
*  I started looking at it more like my body age is still very young.
*  Yeah.
*  You didn't take any abuse up until the time you were 24.
*  You didn't do any training at all.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Ready to be molded into a fighter like ligaments are intact and stuff.
*  I think it's really a matter of how much time are you doing it for?
*  Because I think Randy Couture didn't even have his first pro fight until I think he
*  was 34 or 35.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Go on to win the light heavyweight title, the heavyweight title.
*  And all that stuff like goes into his 40s.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Dan Henderson still knocking people out of like USC.
*  What was it?
*  One ninety nine.
*  You know, he's going to have a text to see if this is still happening.
*  Dan Henderson was supposed to have a bare knuckle boxing fight against Chuck.
*  No, no, no.
*  Exactly.
*  Oh, no.
*  Oh, no.
*  Why?
*  I don't know.
*  I guess money.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, yeah.
*  That's the only reason why.
*  I mean, money, but also like there is part of me that's like, I wonder how I do in a
*  bare knuckle fight.
*  You know, like there's always like I always want to do that left way.
*  Maybe you ever seen that left way kickboxing.
*  I always thought that'd be really cool because like punching without gloves on, like for
*  me, I'm like, that's stupid.
*  I'm going to break my hand.
*  But like kicking, oh, that's fun.
*  You're already fighting barefoot.
*  I'm already doing that.
*  You know, like just kicking, being able to kick like through their hand into their head.
*  Like, I feel like that would be a lot of fun.
*  And then there's headbutts too.
*  Yeah.
*  Left way, they can do everything.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going to get head butted when I fight.
*  Might as well make it legal, you know, use it.
*  I mean, it is an effective technique, particularly if you're in someone's guard.
*  You know, if you're on top and you're holding onto their biceps, you can smash them in the
*  face.
*  Oh, nice.
*  I mean, that's what Mark Coleman used to do.
*  Would he just be like, oh, I was sneezed.
*  I said, like, how do you get away with that?
*  No, it was legal in the day.
*  Oh, it was legal.
*  That was one of Mark Coleman's big weapons.
*  Mark Coleman, back in the bare knuckle days, he would take guys down.
*  He would hold, it didn't matter if you're in the guard or not, he'd smash his fucking
*  forehead right in your nose and then start punching you and beat the shit out of you.
*  And you know, he was a gorilla back then.
*  Mark Coleman, when he was the heavyweight champ, was like 265 on all the Mexican supplements.
*  He was just holding people down.
*  The whole like, quack-o-poo.
*  And he was an elite wrestler.
*  I mean, he had both things going on.
*  Like, serious wrestling skill, huge power, and no drug testing, and headbutts, and bare
*  knuckles.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's everything.
*  He'd headbutt the fuck out of you.
*  Oh my God.
*  I'm surprised he didn't kill anyone.
*  Well, that's one of the things that made Maurice Smith's victory over him even more impressive,
*  because that was during the headbutt days.
*  And Maurice figured out, Maurice was one of the first guys that figured out how important
*  cardio is.
*  Maurice had crazy cardio.
*  So he would be able to survive the early onslaught.
*  He had good defense on the ground, would protect himself.
*  And then once the fight got into the later rounds, he started leg kicking the fuck out
*  of Mark Coleman.
*  I'll never forget that.
*  Because that was the early days of fighting, when everybody thought that Maurice was going
*  to get smashed.
*  Everybody thought that.
*  Damn, I don't know Maurice Smith.
*  Oh, he's great.
*  Great guy.
*  He was an elite kickboxer.
*  Okay.
*  The thing about Maurice, he was a world champion kickboxer.
*  His kickboxing was at a way higher level than anybody had ever seen.
*  He was the first guy to knock out Conan Silvera back when, do you remember those days?
*  I wasn't watching back then.
*  Oh, I see.
*  I was watching.
*  Yeah, I didn't come in until I was about to do it.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe after a couple of Muay Thai fights, I was like, oh, let me start watching his
*  MMA thing.
*  But yeah, everything that I've seen is like YouTube, from back in the day.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Well, the good news is you got a lot of fights you could watch.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I started going back to UFC 1, and I'd watch the full fight card, and I'm just like, holy
*  shit, this is insane.
*  It is crazy.
*  I feel like I remember watching it with my brothers at some point, and somebody goes,
*  man, this shit's gay, turn that channel.
*  I never sat and watched it until once I started doing martial arts.
*  What's crazy is how much things have changed since 1993.
*  Yeah.
*  When people first saw Hoist Gracie choking people off his back, and they're like, what
*  is happening?
*  No one knew anything.
*  Now any little kid knows what a triangle choke is.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Kids in school, they know what arm bars are.
*  They know what rear naked chokes are.
*  Everybody knows it.
*  They know who fucking McGregor is.
*  Yeah, they know who everybody is.
*  They know who Max Holliday is.
*  They know who Max Holliday is.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's weird.
*  People are famous now.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember I went on, did you remember there was a show called the Best Damn Sports Show
*  period?
*  It was like an old school sports show.
*  This is like 2000 something, like early 2000.
*  I went on the show, it was like Tom Arnold and I forget all the people that were on it.
*  But anyway, I was telling them, I go, this sport's going to be huge.
*  I go, it's the most exciting sport in the world, and I think it's going to be as big
*  as any other professional sport.
*  They were just laughing in my face.
*  They were like, wah.
*  They were like, what are you talking about?
*  Cage fighting?
*  There's no fucking way that's ever going to be popular.
*  What's up, Jamie?
*  There's something that announced this back in September, the Henderson-Liddell fight
*  is a parody account that people didn't catch on to.
*  Oh.
*  It's not real.
*  It's not real.
*  It's not real.
*  Meanwhile, that still could happen.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't kid yourself.
*  Hex and Lombard fought last night, or Saturday night.
*  Yeah, that's the most recent event they had.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, he won.
*  I thought about watching that.
*  It was weird.
*  I only watched the ones that Bex on, Bec Rollins.
*  Oh, right, right, right.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But I think-
*  She's a champ, right?
*  Yeah, yeah, bare knuckle champ.
*  Yeah.
*  And she was on there.
*  She came to train with us again.
*  She was one of the first people who were at Alliance, one of the first girls.
*  So that was one of the reasons I went out there.
*  And-
*  How did you wind up getting the alliance?
*  Were you in New York?
*  I was in New York, then I was in North Carolina, and then that stopped working out, like a
*  bunch of weird stuff happened, so I had to find a gym that was good for me, but also
*  had girls.
*  like the thing that I was saying about like training with women it's like after
*  the Tisha Torres fight I was just like yeah I was underestimating how strong
*  this girl could be. Was that the one in Mexico? It was in Mexico City. I was there for that fight I
*  remember these girls like that is crazy altitude yeah it's like 7,000 feet above sea level. I was not prepared. I get tired just walking up the stairs to go take a leak.
*  I'm like this is fucking high altitude. And I did the exact opposite of what you were supposed to do so it's
*  like you either show up a month early or two days before you fight. Right. And I
*  showed up ten days before I fought. I was like oh I acclimate in ten days and it
*  was like that was like right at the peak of like when you really start feeling
*  that altitude sickness. So I was messed up from the altitude I was sick from the I
*  forget what they call it the Montezuma's Revenge. Yeah I was sick from that.
*  I was sick from that altitude. Oh my god I was out with the entire fucking ten days like literally
*  like walking at 115. And so you can see it in my fight pictures too like I'm I
*  look like sunken out like my old Muay Thai photos. Well you guys both were like
*  you were stuck in the mud because the altitude is so high. Yeah. That's crazy to have fights up there. I was so pissed because like right
*  before we fought or when we weighed in and did our little face off Tisha's like hey
*  let's make some money tomorrow. And I was like oh yeah all right let's go let's go. I'm like yeah we're gonna fucking
*  stand and bang. Everyone's gonna be excited. We're in Mexico. They love boxing. We're just gonna hit each other. And then she
*  fucking takes me down. I'm like fuck you. I'm like on the ground and fucking like
*  fucking what do you call it half guard. And I'm just pissed. I'm like come on man. Like just do something at least you know. But yeah she hustled me.
*  That's what Rumble Johnson did to Dan Hardy back when Rumble used to fight at 170 which is still hard to believe. I still have no idea how to fuck made 170.
*  Didn't he only make it like once? He made it a few times. He made it a few times. I mean he won tough at 170. Wow. So if he can make 170 I could probably make 105.
*  Well he can't make it anymore. He got big. He's a heavyweight now. Dude I saw. He's gonna come back and fight heavyweight in UFC. I saw him once in person and his
*  hand was about like two or three of my hands like taped together. Like he's just huge. He's massive. I felt like I could like crawl into it. He's huge. I forget where we were but we were in the he was in between fights and he was 230 pounds.
*  And I saw him. I go what the fuck do you weigh? And he started laughing. He goes I'm about 230. I go no. I'm like how are you going to make 170? Oh my god. And then he had a hard time making 185.
*  I remember he fought Vitor at 185 and he barely made I don't think he made 185. Yeah. Yeah. And then the UFC cut him and he went to the PFL back when it was the PFL and he went what was it World Series of Fighting back then?
*  Oh okay yeah. Yeah it was World Series of Fighting and then he fought Andrzej Arlovski at heavyweight and fucked Arlovski up at heavyweight. I was like this is crazy. This guy was a 170 pound tough champion.
*  And I think he's going to probably come back at heavyweight apparently. Is he going to come back? He says he's coming back. He got bored. I know he was thinking of doing bare knuckle as well. Well if they offer him a lot of money.
*  I feel bad for whoever is on the other end of that fucking huge fist. Yeah I just think of those like oh my god. He's got some lunchbox fists. He hits so hard. I'm sure no one signed that contract. That's probably the reason it never happened.
*  Yeah I still remember the sound that it made when he fought Cormier. Oh yeah. When he head kicked him? It was a punch. Well he hit him with a punch too but he head kicked him. Smack him in the face with a head kick.
*  Oh well I just remember the punch. It was like. Oh that's right the first right hand. Yeah and he lost the fight. I think he smothered him. Yeah Cormier beat him both times. Yeah yeah. But it was that first punch. I was just like holy shit.
*  We're all amazed. You just heard that crack and we're all amazed that Cormier was able to just fucking walk through it. Yeah. Like shook it off. But yeah that. Yeah I always remember that.
*  Well when he knocked out Glover with one punch I was like holy shit. That uppercut. He's got freak power. Oh the big one. Yeah the pitchers were crazy.
*  The Minotauro fight too. Knocked him out with one punch. He was a freak man. He's a real freak. I'm interested to see if he does do. I mean he was burnt out he said. He's like I don't want to do this anymore.
*  And then he took some time off and then he started feeling it again. Yeah. And now he's training with Henry Hooft. He's hitting paths. He said he's going to give himself like six months to really get in shape and really train hard and get back to it.
*  But he said he might fight at 205 too. He's thinking about. I mean look at 205. There's you know look there's John Jones and now there's Dominic Reyes and then you know Jan Blachowicz who just knocked out Corey.
*  There's a lot of a lot of moving pieces. Right. And that guy fits right in there. I mean anybody who stands in front of him Michael Knight Knight. Yeah. Anybody. Yeah. I'd like to see that. I like to see. I like Anthony as a person. Yeah.
*  He's just exciting as a fighter too. His. Yeah. His style is so crazy like you know someone's going to sleep. You know. Yeah. But he could take it too. I mean he's got a giant fucking jaws.
*  Everything about him is huge. Yeah. Big ass head. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Physical freaks. It's a great time in the sport though. There's so much exciting. So many exciting possible matchups.
*  Are you. What are you pumped for. Like when you look at the like the the.
*  Straw weights. Oh everything. Or just everyone. Well it's draw weights. You have to be paying attention to the title fight. Yeah. Yeah. Next month rather. Yeah. No I'm definitely paying attention to that.
*  Were you surprised when you watch Waley and Jessica on Drudge. Not really. Like the thing is like I was catching and Drudge when she would run in and it wasn't until the third round that I decided to use elbows and I'm pretty sure I dropped there in the third round.
*  And she popped right back up. But like ever since then I noticed that like she would get hit like she would get hit and rock like in the end of Torres fight like Tisha isn't known for having like knockout power crazy hands but she dropped her like a good like two or three times in the end of Torres fight.
*  So I could see that that chin was get in touch. Well you remember the you want to get check fight. She just she ate a fuck load of shots. Yeah. But it didn't look like she was getting wobbled. No as much. No.
*  But maybe she did because like when she came back and fought Tisha she was like going like wobbly leg like every now and then like eventually she closed the distance and took it down. But it's like she sacrifices her chin to get that distance you know.
*  And like same thing with the Rose fight she was getting picked apart the entire time sacrificing her head to get in and get the throw or whatever. And then finally like you know gave out on her in the way Lee fight.
*  So I wasn't like super surprised. I was I mean everyone was surprised. So I won't say that. But I did see that coming eventually like I'm like eventually someone's going to put her out just because it's not just the person's power that she's fighting but it's her pressure is so aggressive and she's coming in so hard.
*  So it's like her force versus the other person's punch when they connect like she's knocking herself out essentially.
*  Yeah.
*  So so yeah like I wasn't super surprised. Like that was that was what my what I thought would happen when I fought her. Like I didn't go into that fight thinking oh man is going to suck. You know I was like dude I can catch her like she drops her hands when she comes forward like my I can strike going backwards like I know I'm going to catch her.
*  And like I can put her out because of the way she strikes. So I've always seen that her hands were a bit sloppy even though she's super aggressive and the fact that she's so aggressive gives her that much success like you you can't ignore the fact that she's punching you as much as she is.
*  But it's still like very offensive and like with zero defense in mind. So so yeah I wasn't like super surprised when someone finally did drop her but you know I hadn't really seen that much of a way Lee Zhang.
*  So so I was surprised that she was able to get the title that that fast.
*  Have you ever seen her strength conditioning routine that she does.
*  No I have.
*  That lady goes hard. Yeah she goes hard. It's pretty wild. It's pretty wild to watch. It's very inspiring. How do you feel as she matches up with you on because that the fights is real. That's real soon.
*  I think it's going to be I think it's going to be an even match. I think she has a lot of output. I think she isn't afraid to go to the ground.
*  I saw that when she fought Tisha they had like a lot of crazy scrambles. She had good reverses for like Tisha's takedown attempts and stuff.
*  And yeah I just think it's going to be like she's going to force Joanna to move and to react more than most people I think.
*  Like as long as she's like I haven't really seen I haven't really paid attention to like how much head movement she has.
*  But I do know that she just throws a lot of volume and wherever the fight goes she seems comfortable.
*  So I've never seen her in a spot where she looks like oh what do I do here. You know like you see people freaking out against the cage or freaking out when they get taken down.
*  And she seems to flow. She has that athletic flow through everything. So that's the one thing I think she has going for.
*  But I do think Joanna's reach is what's made her so dominant. She's a big old girl.
*  Watching her fight and draw there was a moment where she's pushing and drawed up against the cage and she looks like a big old praying mantis.
*  Like you know just like biting someone's head off. And draw looks like this little thing.
*  So she's a big girl with a really long reach, really long legs and everything.
*  I'm kind of surprised to see her back at 115 because she really struggled.
*  Well I was going to try to fill in that last minute. I don't know if you heard but it kind of upped my props or whatever.
*  When she was about to fight Michelle there were rumors that she wasn't going to make weight.
*  And so people were scrambling and then my manager, yeah I think I can talk about that.
*  My manager, hopefully fingers crossed, my manager got the call like hey man I'm just worried about this Joanna fight.
*  And my manager was like whoa I bet Angela would take it if you guys wanted to fight.
*  And he was like seriously? And he was like yeah she's crazy.
*  And I was there cornering my teammate Lauren Mueller at the time.
*  So I was there chilling, where were we, Atlanta I think?
*  Maybe, I forget where it was. It might have been Atlanta.
*  But I was there chilling cornering my friend and then my manager calls and he's like hey.
*  And it was like that time of the night that you know it's a fight offer.
*  So he's like hey.
*  What time is that?
*  It was like maybe 11 ish or something.
*  Oh so something weird is going on.
*  Yeah it was like 11pm and I was like who?
*  And he's like would you fight Joanna at 125?
*  And I was like fuck yeah.
*  And I was probably walking about 125 at the moment.
*  And I think we were talking back or he was talking back and forth.
*  And he was like well what about Michelle at 115?
*  He just wanted to know just so he can relay the message.
*  And I was like yeah just let me know so I can cut weight or not cut weight.
*  So I was sitting waiting for the call and then the rumors got blasted.
*  And then people knew my name was in it for some reason.
*  I was just like who is talking?
*  But it went viral and I just leaned into it.
*  I was like hey anytime any place let's go.
*  And I waited waited and then yeah nothing happened.
*  Joanna made weight.
*  I was like damn.
*  I heard that she wasn't making weight either.
*  Yeah yeah everyone was talking about it.
*  And then somehow somebody knew that my name was in the mix.
*  And then Angela Hill might fill in for Michelle instead of filling for Joanna.
*  Because she was like the name that they were promoting for the fight.
*  So they wanted the former champ to get her fight.
*  So they were like alright if it comes down to it Angela will fight her at 125.
*  So I was pretty stoked.
*  I mean I feel like Joanna does a lot of things.
*  And it's similar with my matchup that I have now only she's a lot bigger.
*  Joanna does a lot of things that I've seen a lot of.
*  And training just like in my first years of Muay Thai.
*  She has a very conventional style when it comes to Muay Thai.
*  She's just very good at it.
*  So a fight with Joanna is always something that I've wanted to have.
*  Just because I felt like it would be something that I've seen before.
*  I'm not going to be afraid of the clinch.
*  Which she's really good at.
*  I'm not going to be afraid of the clinch.
*  I'm not going to be afraid of when an elbow is going to come.
*  Because elbows sparred my entire fight career.
*  So it's like things that I see with her are less scary than a fight with someone that she's beat before.
*  Like Andrade or Gedelio or someone like that.
*  We're going to learn about her a lot this coming fight.
*  And I think what she's got left.
*  Because the transition to 25 didn't really work out.
*  Shevchenko was just a little too much for her.
*  Shevchenko had already beat her outside the UFC and then beat her again.
*  And then it just didn't look like she had the firepower to keep her off her at 125.
*  And then so she goes down to 15 again.
*  But we know how hard it was for her to make 15.
*  And that's one of the things that they had said, her camp had said about her chin.
*  When she fought Rose.
*  She just couldn't take a shot.
*  It was because she was so depleted.
*  So we'll find out because Whaley hits fucking hard.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And she's like, I don't know.
*  I know she's so determined.
*  Like I feel like she'd kill herself to make weight.
*  She just has a long career though.
*  You know, a long combat sports career.
*  And at a certain point in time, you got to wonder when that catches up to you.
*  Or one of the things that she was saying, that she was in a real bad relationship.
*  And there was a giant distraction.
*  And now she's done with that.
*  And that was a contributing factor to a lot of her losses.
*  So we're going to find out because when you go back to when she fought Jessica Panay,
*  she was the scariest woman alive.
*  She was fucking ferocious.
*  When she was the champ and she was lighting everybody on fire, she was terrifying.
*  She was so aggressive and so technical.
*  She had that long jab.
*  She also had a lot of fighters who weren't that technically sound striking.
*  Or at least not confident with their striking.
*  So when she did fight someone who was good, who was actually a better striker than her and Rose.
*  Just the fact that Rose could move laterally.
*  You know, like Ioana was always a back and forth fighter because that's her style of very Muay Thai.
*  And Rose just moving to the side every now and then or having head movement,
*  I think that really fucked her up.
*  And it's hard when you fight someone like that for the first time.
*  Or even spar someone like that for the first time.
*  You can't find them.
*  You know, all your punches miss.
*  You gas out.
*  You're freaking out because you're missing your punches.
*  Then you're getting countered.
*  It's like a lot to deal with for a straightforward Muay Thai fighter.
*  That is a weird thing about Muay Thai, right?
*  How few of them move their head.
*  Because we don't have footwork.
*  We just stand and bang.
*  Only a bitch would run away from a fight.
*  But some people do have footwork like San Chai.
*  San Chai's got crazy footwork.
*  He's like the only one.
*  He could do like fucking cartwheel kicks and shit.
*  Like San Chai can do everything.
*  But he's so good, you would think that someone else would mimic that style.
*  It's one of those styles that are just so hard to mimic.
*  And the sport traditionally is not his style.
*  He's very unorthodox.
*  So look at any unorthodox fighter.
*  You're not going to see a million dominant crews like copycats coming out.
*  You see like one or two.
*  They try.
*  Yeah, they try.
*  But they're never going to be dumb.
*  San Chai is that kind of fighter.
*  He was brought in doing this very predictable style.
*  He just made it weird and made it his own.
*  That's why he's so cool.
*  He's always on his toes.
*  Always.
*  Just boing, boing, boing.
*  Just the alley shuffle.
*  He's never flat footed.
*  No, no.
*  Never.
*  He always knows how to pull.
*  He can pull the counters out.
*  He knows exactly how to twitch in order to make you go oh and then boom.
*  It could be a foot.
*  It could be a hand.
*  It could be anything because he just comes from all angles.
*  He'll also throw a head kick when he's two inches away from you.
*  Yeah.
*  He'll do wild shit.
*  He basically throws a head kick straight up in the air.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He does a lot of wild stuff.
*  He's nuts.
*  He can do the weird karate pop, pop, pop when they just jump back and forth.
*  He'll fake one and then he'll do the cartwheel kick.
*  He's close to 40 now.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the crazy thing.
*  Which is amazing for a lighter weight Muay Thai fighter.
*  Yeah, for a Thai fighter.
*  You start at six out there.
*  I think that style has preserved him in a lot of ways.
*  He's not just catching and returning and standing in front like a lot of those guys do.
*  He's always very elusive.
*  Lurdzil is pretty elusive but there's not a lot of really elusive guys in Muay Thai.
*  No, even Bull Call is just kind of a march him down and hit him type of fighter.
*  Just left kick the fuck out of you.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's one thing I really credit going to Alliance with is just my movement has gotten
*  way more fluid.
*  Eric Del Fiero is one of the most unheralded guys.
*  Yeah.
*  For whatever reason.
*  People don't sing his praises but he's excellent.
*  It's kind of like the theme of the gym.
*  Really?
*  Everyone who comes out of there is like no one gives Jeremy the credit that he deserves.
*  No one gives Dom the credit they deserve.
*  I guess I'm a little more sensitive because I know them now and I'm like, man, those guys
*  are great.
*  Yeah.
*  Eric definitely, no one ever talks about him but he's so good at what he does.
*  His corner work is so excellent.
*  He gives you real technical information in the corner and he knows how to break it down
*  quickly.
*  This is what you're doing wrong.
*  This is what you have to do right.
*  This is what you're doing great.
*  Keep doing more of this.
*  Look out for that.
*  When you do this, do that.
*  He gives you all that shit.
*  You see people go, okay, okay, okay.
*  Some people are like, you need to take him out.
*  You need to take him out.
*  Like, oh, never saw that.
*  It's kind of like, Eric's kind of a psychopath with that shit.
*  Really?
*  Like, he's like no emotion.
*  It really takes a lot to draw emotion out of him and then you feel proud of yourself.
*  You're like, oh, I got under your skin.
*  You're a little softy.
*  But yeah, he's definitely like, he's very stoic when it comes to that stuff, which makes
*  it makes the instruction more clear.
*  Yes.
*  There's no anxiety in his voice.
*  There's no freaking out.
*  He's just like, do this, do this, do this.
*  That was a good round.
*  You might have lost that round.
*  You know, like he'll just give it to you straight up and say it quickly enough so that you can
*  be like, okay, what next?
*  And yes, it's always been like really chill when he's cornered me.
*  It's interesting because he doesn't try to get any attention.
*  No, he hates it.
*  He runs from the camera.
*  He's so weird.
*  Good for him.
*  Good for him.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's pretty cool though.
*  That's what attracted me to the gym because you see a lot of people trying to big themselves
*  up or name drop or do this and that.
*  And even if the person, even if it's merited, they've proven themselves.
*  The fact that they have to, I don't know, convince you always makes you feel like they're
*  trying to hustle you.
*  Yes.
*  They need too much.
*  They're too needy.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So when I came to Alliance, I was like, yeah, would it be okay if I train here?
*  Because there were already a few straw weights there and I didn't want to come stomping in
*  on territory and being like, I train here now.
*  And he's like, yeah, if you want to train here, train here, 10%.
*  After your fight, no contracts or anything.
*  Just like if you end up not liking it here, you can go somewhere else.
*  There's no obligations.
*  And I was just like, oh, that's cool.
*  Because I had just come from a place where I had to sign a contract saying I trained
*  there for this many years or however many fights I have.
*  And it's just such a strange thing to do.
*  It is strange because it goes sideways and then you're locked up in a contract and it's
*  hard to get out of it and they want money if you even have another trainer.
*  Or they think they can have a lawsuit against you even though there's zero things that actually
*  hold you to that contract because it was badly worded or something.
*  But they'll still try and it'll be an annoying thing.
*  And luckily I was able to part ways in a good way.
*  I just paid my coach and it was like, I need to go somewhere where I have more training
*  partners and this and that.
*  And he was like, yeah, that's fine.
*  So luckily it was chill, but I've heard horror stories.
*  I've heard a lot of horror stories.
*  So when he said that, I was immediately like, oh, that's cool.
*  And that's how my first coach in New York was too.
*  He was like, hey, if you need to go somewhere to learn how to do MMA, that's cool.
*  No hard feelings.
*  Is Brandon Vera still at Alliance?
*  He is not training there, but he's still part owner.
*  He still comes through when he is in San Diego.
*  Where's he training now?
*  He's in the Philippines now.
*  So he trains in the Philippines too.
*  He lives there and trains there.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  What a crazy career shift he's had.
*  Huh?
*  I know.
*  Also, he's one heavyweight champion.
*  I know.
*  He's out there doing it.
*  One is nuts.
*  He's out there doing it.
*  I'm like, damn, like, can I say I'm like blazing or something?
*  Can y'all get me in there?
*  It's interesting, right?
*  Like if you're a Filipino and you fight for one, like, woo.
*  Yeah, they love you.
*  Especially if it's a heavyweight.
*  A big giant Filipino.
*  Dude, he's doing it.
*  He's like in movies out there and stuff.
*  Really?
*  I don't know which ones.
*  I think I watch part of it.
*  But yeah, he's living it up.
*  Well, he's so fucking big too.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like 240 something now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's nuts.
*  It's nuts to see him.
*  He's huge.
*  I like watching him do pads.
*  Like they have to bring out the big pad holder or whatever.
*  For sure.
*  Kick a bag, and he kicks the bag.
*  And it's like a big ass heavy bag,
*  but it still folds in half when he kicks it.
*  Yeah, he's sick.
*  But yeah, he's like, yeah, he showed us
*  some cool clinch stuff and cool techniques
*  when he comes through.
*  And he likes to motivate the up and comers
*  when he comes through too.
*  So it's always nice to see him.
*  Well, he was a small, light heavyweight early in the day.
*  Well, actually he was a small heavyweight.
*  Remember when he knocked out Frank Mir?
*  That was back when he was training with Rob Kamen.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he was fucking people up at heavyweight.
*  He was like 210, 215.
*  Yeah, he was just really fucking tall.
*  Yeah, he wasn't like, well, you'd look at him.
*  He didn't look like a heavyweight.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting to see a company like One
*  explode and get bigger, and then see guys like Mighty Mouse
*  and Eddie Alvarez and see world class fighters go over there.
*  Yeah, I was sad to see Mighty Mouse go, though.
*  He was another one of my motivators.
*  Like, man, I want to be like that guy.
*  I was sad to see him go in a way,
*  but happy because I knew he was getting paid.
*  Yeah.
*  They wanted him over there, and it was a big get.
*  Because look, for my money, he's still
*  the best example of a mixed martial arts
*  fighter I've ever seen.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  The full package.
*  Yeah, you could say John eclipsed him as the goat,
*  and I think he did.
*  Because John has beaten better fighters.
*  He's beaten the best of the best.
*  I mean, Mighty Mouse knocked out Benavides.
*  He's beaten good fighters.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  He definitely fucked up Sohuto in the first round
*  in their first fight.
*  But he didn't have the same pool of talent
*  that John Jones had to go through.
*  Guys like Leota Machida, Rashad Evans, Rampage Jackson,
*  like goat down the line.
*  Everyone he fought is a fucking killer.
*  Since the time he knocks out Shogun Hua,
*  23 years old, to win the title.
*  And since then, for the last nine years,
*  he's stormed through everyone they put in front of him.
*  That's the goat.
*  I mean, it's hard to argue with that.
*  Just the level of talent.
*  But when you look at what Mighty Mouse
*  was able to do to people,
*  when he's able to do to Wilson Hayes,
*  what he's able to do to a lot of guys who are good fighters,
*  he makes them look like you have no business
*  being in there with him.
*  He's doing a whole different thing than you're doing.
*  You think he's there, and he's here,
*  and you think he's here, and he's there,
*  and then you're getting hit, and you're getting punched,
*  and you're getting taken down,
*  and you think you're gonna get hit.
*  He just could do everything.
*  Yeah, that's the thing that makes him so crazy,
*  is that he can do everything in the book.
*  Yeah, he's not a striker.
*  You don't have to just worry about one thing.
*  How about Ray Borg?
*  How about when he suplexes him
*  and then catches him with an armbar on the way down?
*  That's the one I was thinking of.
*  Yeah, that's what I wasn't sure who it was,
*  but it was like, what the fuck?
*  Catches him on the way down with a,
*  like a fucking movie.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  In a world title fight, defending his title.
*  No, that was nuts.
*  That was so nuts.
*  Mighty Mouse was something real special.
*  I felt like that put him on such a crazy level of expertise
*  when he did that one.
*  Wasn't that the one before he got released?
*  I feel like that was his last fight.
*  The Cejudo fight was the last fight.
*  Well, no, I mean the one before he lost.
*  That was the one before he lost against Cejudo.
*  I think you're right.
*  So it's almost like they were like,
*  well, there's nothing else we can do with you.
*  Obviously, you're gonna do that to everyone else.
*  The future of that division was uncertain.
*  They weren't even sure what they were gonna do
*  with the division.
*  Once Cejudo won, and then now that Cejudo went up
*  and he beat Marlon Marais for the Bantamweight title
*  and then they have this situation
*  where they're gonna have Figuerito and Benavidez
*  fight for the Flyweight title.
*  So Cejudo abandons that title
*  and Mighty Mouse did the right thing.
*  He got big money over there.
*  They paid him a lot of money to fight in one of his,
*  and they give him hard fights too,
*  because they don't have hydration over there either,
*  or dehydration.
*  So you fight at what you weigh,
*  which I think really is what we should be doing.
*  Yeah, and I don't think Mighty Mouse was ever cutting weight.
*  No, not much.
*  He was always just walking around that weight.
*  Yeah, I mean he may be like 135,
*  but he's not cutting anything substantial.
*  And when he was fighting at 35, when there was no 125,
*  everybody was just so much bigger than him.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We still have that picture in the gym of Dom Suplex.
*  Yeah, he's so much smaller than Dom.
*  I'm like, aw, poor Mighty Mouse.
*  I'm glad you went to the Flyweight.
*  Well, I mean he's spectacular over there.
*  He's doing really well.
*  And they've got fucking killers over there too.
*  Like that guy that knocked out Eddie Alvarez,
*  Timothy Natsuyuken, that guy's a fucking savage.
*  He's scary.
*  Just because you haven't heard of them
*  doesn't mean they haven't been training for 10, 15 years
*  and have all these fights over there waiting.
*  Waiting for this opportunity, yeah.
*  I feel like there's gonna be a point in time
*  where there's gonna have to be
*  some sort of a unification fight,
*  whether it's a Bellator unification fight,
*  because I still think that Diego Lima,
*  he's the one that I look at,
*  and I go, that guy I think is, he's elite at 170.
*  Like he might be as good as anybody alive at 170.
*  I'd like to see him.
*  And there was a funny face-off with him and Kamaru Usman.
*  Oh yeah, I saw that in Houston.
*  I mean, I don't know if that's something
*  the UFC would ever do, but fuck,
*  if I ran the UFC, that would be what I'd wanna do.
*  It really should happen, yeah, it really should happen.
*  I mean, they have like female flyweights too.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Like that could be a thing, you know?
*  Like put in two title fights there and there you go.
*  That would be fun, do it in Hawaii.
*  It would have to be a time, if I wanna vacation.
*  Yeah, no, you know how Max has been campaigning,
*  Max all right, campaigning, like UFC Hawaii,
*  and then Bellator did it.
*  Just like as a fuck you.
*  Well, if Max has a rematch against Alexander Volkonovsky,
*  that would be a good place to do it.
*  You know, but I think in Hawaii, the big place is outdoor,
*  and you never know in Hawaii if it's gonna rain.
*  Yeah, especially like a destination like that.
*  It's probably gonna rain for like 20 minutes,
*  like right before you start the title fight,
*  and then stop raining.
*  Well, if they could just put some kind of a cover
*  over just the octagon, maybe they could actually do it.
*  I don't know.
*  But I just feel like these other organizations,
*  whether it's ONE or Bellator,
*  they're getting to this point where you might see it.
*  And then Rory McDonald just went to the PFL.
*  Yeah, that is what they're calling it, right?
*  It used to be the World Series of Fighting,
*  then it's the PFL, right?
*  Yeah, the million dollar tournament.
*  Yeah, Rory just went over to that.
*  Cool.
*  Which I was pretty shocked,
*  because he went to Bellator, I was shocked at that,
*  and then he won the title at Bellator,
*  and then he went over to the PFL.
*  I wonder why he did that, huh?
*  I'm sure they just offered him a big check.
*  Yeah, we had a guy win the million dollar tournament
*  this year. Oh, really?
*  Yeah, Emiliano Sorted.
*  Oh, okay, right, right.
*  Yeah, yeah, he won.
*  They gave away like six different
*  million dollar tournaments, right?
*  Yeah. That's crazy.
*  I'm like, where is this money coming from?
*  I don't know, how are we gonna do that?
*  Like, get cashed in checks?
*  Yeah, but that's the thing that something like ONE FC
*  or PFL, they kind of have to do that.
*  If they want to bring over a guy like Eddie Alvarez
*  or Mighty Mouse, you gotta come with the big money.
*  And they have it, they sell out giant places over there.
*  Yeah, are they doing that, what is the name of the big one
*  in Japan?
*  Saitama Arena?
*  Oh, Saitama Super Arena, are they doing that?
*  Yeah, are they doing it like places like that?
*  I don't know.
*  They do it in Singapore, I know they're doing it
*  in some pretty big places. Oh, they haven't been
*  to Japan yet, have they?
*  Have they? I don't think so.
*  I don't know, I'm fascinated though.
*  I really like when there's competition.
*  I like when something rises.
*  Like, one of my saddest moments in MMA is that
*  Fedor in his prime never fought in the UFC.
*  When Kane was in his prime and Fedor was in his prime,
*  god damn, that would have been glorious.
*  To see those two go at it, woo, that would have been amazing.
*  You know, that's the thing about MMA is that these
*  organizations are, you know, it's the UFC really
*  and then there's everybody else.
*  The UFC's the top of the food chain and everybody else
*  is trying real hard and every now and then someone will,
*  like a Douglas Lima or a Fedor, they'll get to a point
*  where you're like, huh, I wanna see that guy fight
*  against the best in the UFC, I wanna see what's up.
*  Well, they kinda do it with Bellator and Ryzen.
*  Like, they've started mixing, they had a Darian Caldwell
*  fight, a Horiguchi, and that was like, I don't know,
*  that was just like a really big deal.
*  I feel like anytime you have the two, it's kinda like
*  team fights, you know?
*  Anytime you have that happening, it's just, I don't know,
*  it just makes things more interesting.
*  I think so, yeah.
*  So I totally agree, I'd be down for that.
*  It's just someone has to rise.
*  Someone has to become this undeniable force where
*  everybody's clamoring for the fight.
*  And then the UFC will go, listen, there's a lot of money
*  in this, let's do it.
*  But right now that hasn't happened.
*  Bellator has never really gained the sort of notoriety
*  that the UFC has.
*  Like if you were fighting in Bellator,
*  some people would know who you are, but it'd probably be
*  less than half the people.
*  Right, right.
*  It's like the NFL or Q-Tips versus cotton swabs.
*  Everybody wants Q-Tips, you know what I mean?
*  Yeah, yeah, it's the brand name.
*  Yeah, and if you look at the sheer number of fighters
*  that are elite in the UFC, it's undoubtedly the best
*  fighters in the world.
*  But then there's a few.
*  There's a few of those Bellator fighters that really
*  fucking stand out.
*  And there's a few of those one fighters that really
*  stand out, and you go, hmm, I don't know.
*  They might be able to hang with anybody in the world.
*  Yeah, it's just gonna take time.
*  The more they pay people, the more they start paying out
*  as well as the UFC, the more you're gonna get those
*  talented people to go there instead of holding out
*  for a spot in the contender series.
*  And then once that changing of the guard happens
*  a couple times, then you'll definitely see it.
*  And then it'll probably be undeniable at that point.
*  But I don't know, probably, I don't know.
*  I don't know if it's gonna happen anytime soon.
*  Well, listen, Angela, I'm happy we got you in here.
*  I'm very excited for your fight this weekend.
*  Tell me your opponent's name again.
*  Do you not remember her name?
*  Loma.
*  I'm like that Thai girl.
*  Loma Lukbunmi.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah, very Thai.
*  So I'm excited for your fight.
*  Thank you.
*  And I'm just happy to have you in here.
*  Yeah, thanks man.
*  I'm a fan, and so just good luck this weekend
*  and let's make it happen.
*  Cool, thanks.
*  I love it, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  Thank you.
*  And good luck on your flight too.
*  Thanks a lot.
*  Bye everybody.
*  Cool.
*  ["Sweet Home Alone"]
