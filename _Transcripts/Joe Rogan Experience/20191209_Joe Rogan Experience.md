# Joe Rogan Experience #1396 - Michelle Wolf
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 09, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOT7UCaCJHY)
*  Yes! How many lame wolf jokes have you had to endure over your life?
*  You know what? I like them.
*  Do you? What's the worst?
*  Yeah, bring them on. Joe List constantly tries to get the nickname Wolf of Wall Street started.
*  Every time I see him, he's like, Wolf of Wall Street.
*  Why?
*  It's going to catch on. He says it to no one. It's going to catch on. It's going to catch
*  on.
*  You were saying that you like the Tamar coffee, but you don't like to admit that you like
*  that stuff?
*  Yeah, I recently got into all this new agey health stuff and crystals.
*  You get into crystals?
*  I mean a little bit. I'm on the fringe of the crystal. I might be wearing a little rose
*  quartz.
*  What's the thought behind being into crystals?
*  I honestly think it's a lot of it's just in your 30s at some point. As a woman, I think
*  you get into crystals.
*  Yeah, if you don't get a kid or a dog.
*  Yeah, you're just like, you know what? Maybe I can bring some energy from somewhere. Why
*  not?
*  Start burning sage.
*  Yeah. I don't think it'll last forever. I just think I'm in a little bit of a crystal
*  phase right now.
*  A spiritual phase?
*  Kind of, yeah. I was thinking about, oh my God, this is so embarrassing. Why am I starting
*  so embarrassing? I was thinking about maybe looking up shamans in New York to be like,
*  I think I can get like, just explore the spiritual universe a little bit. I think it means I'm
*  lonely.
*  It probably means you're lonely. But shamans, do you want to do drugs?
*  Oh, I mean, I'd love to do ayahuasca.
*  Yeah, so they're not going to be listed. You're going to have to find some, you can't just
*  Google them. Some narc can just kind of Google ayahuasca. You could get away with it legally
*  right now in Oakland. If you go to Oakland.
*  Oh yeah?
*  They fucking stepped up. They decriminalized everything.
*  Yeah, mushrooms are good.
*  Everything. Everything. They're like, fuck it, do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is what we need. Slowly but surely, that's going to be the whole country.
*  Mushrooms are, I love mushrooms.
*  Want to do some right now?
*  I have too many other things to do today. I recently did them and I all of a sudden, I
*  didn't realize this had happened on mushrooms. I got so giggly.
*  Oh yeah, if you take the right amount, you get super giggly.
*  Just giggled for hours. I was like, oh, this is the best. I'm sure it was annoying to everyone
*  around me, which is also pretty normal. But I'm giggling nonstop at anything.
*  Well, a lot of people are microdosing now and what they're doing is they're taking a
*  level of, they're taking enough psilocybin so that you don't quite feel it. It's like
*  knocking on the door or feeling it, almost there. But they report this amazing alleviation
*  of anxiety. They feel super creative and really friendly and all these powerful positive
*  vibes but they're basically sober.
*  Yeah, I don't know, does it affect you if you actually wanted to take?
*  Oh, to blast off?
*  Yeah, would you have to take an extraordinary amount?
*  You can always blast off. You're going to be able to blast off every single time. I
*  can't imagine that somehow or another it would get in the way. The feeling that happens when
*  you take a large dose where it's like you just feel the tingling and you get fucking
*  scared. Like that shit's coming.
*  I always have to put my hand here for hours, just like on my heart.
*  At the beginning of the Gulf War, like right after 9-11, Stan Hope and I got fucked up
*  on mushrooms like the day of the war and we were watching TV and they were like, war coverage.
*  We all got to serve our country some way.
*  That's how we do it. We get high and watch TV. We were watching TV and it says, war coverage
*  begins today at 5. And he goes, holy shit, there's a kickoff for the war. That war, that
*  war, like the invasion of Iraq, the most recent one, not Desert Storm, but the most recent
*  one, that is forever cemented in my head by mushrooms and him saying, holy shit, there's
*  a kickoff.
*  There's a coin toss.
*  It was so weird.
*  That would make war more fun if they were like, they broadcast it like a game.
*  It would, right?
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, flag on the play. There's some IEDs.
*  It might be the future. Like when you have robot wars.
*  No, I don't.
*  Because in the future, I don't think people are going to be fighting people.
*  Robots scare me.
*  They should.
*  So much. I don't know why we're making them. I was doing a gig at MIT recently and I spent
*  the first 10 minutes yelling at them to stop making robots. They make these cheetahs. Why
*  are you making robot cheetahs? What is the point of that?
*  Well, that's Boston Dynamics. That's not MIT.
*  Oh yeah. But they, but there's all the same people. They're all working together.
*  Lex works at MIT. Yeah, he's a professor at MIT, Lex Friedman, who's a specialist in AI.
*  He's been on this podcast a couple of times before. Yeah. They're a little bit too blase
*  about it.
*  No, I don't like it. I'm not a fan. I won't even have an Alexa in my home.
*  Oh, don't fuck that. They're listening. Yeah. They're listening.
*  I also feel like that like, like 10 years from now, people are going to be like, do
*  you remember she said she didn't want to have an Alexa in her home?
*  Yeah.
*  Like that's like going to be the new racist. Scarlet Letter.
*  You hate robots.
*  Yeah. They're going to put a mark in your door.
*  I'll never be Senator now.
*  They'll put a black X on your door. Does it like robots?
*  I hate them. I hate them.
*  Never be Senator. You don't want to be, you're not going to run for shit, right?
*  No.
*  Never. I'm having too much fun.
*  Why would you want to stop having fun?
*  But did you think about like when Trump was giving you a hard time, did you think, hey,
*  motherfucker, if I ran against you, I could really fuck you up. Did you ever think about
*  that?
*  No.
*  For a second while he was tweeting against you and all the craziness that was going there?
*  Never. I'm like, it didn't even occur to me, but also I'm still 34. So I couldn't even
*  run if I wanted to.
*  How old do you have to be? 36?
*  35.
*  That's the only qualification for president. 35 and born here.
*  Yeah, right? Isn't that crazy?
*  Born there is important. Born here is super important.
*  Because you don't want anybody sneaking in and just ruining the entire country on the
*  sneak tip.
*  Although if I was, I'd be like a long game terrorist. You know, like yeah, they were
*  born here, but they were incels the whole time.
*  Yeah, half the kids over here.
*  This is three generations of Americans.
*  They plan in advance. They do plan some terrorists and some organizations do plan things way,
*  way, way in advance.
*  Yeah.
*  That's like the thing they say about China, that China plans things like hundreds of years
*  out.
*  Yeah, they're good at it. Yeah. Yeah. They're really, we underestimate China.
*  Well, how about that fucking wall? How long did that take to make?
*  I don't know, probably like six days knowing how hard they work.
*  I think it took hundreds of years.
*  They were just like, no, we got this. Don't worry.
*  They were just getting tired of being invaded.
*  I mean, that country is like, I mean, they invented everything.
*  Everything.
*  And they've been around forever.
*  They've been around forever. And we just were like, no, no reason to be scared of them.
*  They've been China forever.
*  Forever.
*  Forever.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean, America's a baby, a little tiny baby.
*  Yeah, we're a little baby. We're a little asshole baby.
*  They have bombs. They have the best electronics.
*  They steal everything. Yeah.
*  All the intellectual property. Like, fuck you. They don't have any rules.
*  Yeah.
*  No, we copy.
*  I used to work at this tech company and like we had a lot of Chinese people that work.
*  It was a computational biochemistry research lab.
*  So of course we had a lot of Chinese people that worked there because they were
*  What are you trying to say?
*  very smart and qualified.
*  That sounds racist.
*  And that's my favorite thing is like, when you're like, you're racist.
*  I just said you are smart.
*  We said you're amazing.
*  Is it racist that you guys are amazing?
*  Well, then people, they get, they're like, not all Chinese people are doing well.
*  And I'm like, yeah, I'm sure there's Chinese people that aren't doing well, but, you know,
*  their parents never talk about them.
*  Well, there's a lot of Chinese people.
*  When you say not all Chinese people are doing well, there's fucking a billion of them.
*  Yeah. I mean, there's plenty that aren't doing well, but the ones that are doing well are
*  doing really well.
*  Yeah. You're concentrating on the glasses half empty.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, really.
*  But the
*  There's a billion people.
*  I mean, people that worked at this tech company, if they were Chinese nationals, they were
*  only allowed to have access to certain parts.
*  Like there were certain parts they had to keep separate from them and they couldn't
*  know about.
*  Did they come over and stare at your computer?
*  I had one guy who worked there.
*  What are you working on?
*  Me? I'm just like, I'm just recruiting new people to work here.
*  You're not going to get anything from me.
*  I don't understand what we're doing here.
*  But the one guy who worked there, he came over, didn't know any English and he learned
*  English by watching Seinfeld.
*  So I kid you not, he had this Seinfeld cadence that he spoke with.
*  Where? That's the break room.
*  And he'd enter rooms a little bit like Kramer.
*  No.
*  I swear. Not the full thing, but every time he'd come into the office, he'd be like, whoa.
*  No. Really?
*  I swear.
*  Whoa. That's weird.
*  I wonder if there's an equivalent show in China where if you went over there and tried to learn
*  Mandarin from a television show, what would you concentrate on?
*  Yeah. It's like a way to hold your, I'm going to get too racist.
*  Hold on.
*  Chopsticks. Don't say it.
*  This is funny. Chopsticks is racist.
*  No, it's racial, you fucks.
*  There's a difference between racial and racist.
*  I enjoy chopsticks.
*  It's a great way to eat salad, by the way.
*  It's a great way to eat slower.
*  Yeah. Well, yeah, if you want to eat rice.
*  It's real slow. But if you want to eat salad, it's like the best way to eat salad.
*  I eat salad with chopsticks.
*  Yeah. Could you ever try to get a fork in a tomato?
*  It's fucking hard. You can grab a lot of lettuce with them chopsticks.
*  I'm going to try that next time.
*  Yeah. Forks with sushi? Get the fuck out of here.
*  You have to use chopsticks.
*  Or your hands. I use my hands a lot.
*  You're an animal. Savage. Like a wolf.
*  Let's see how many we can get in this podcast.
*  We can get a couple. I got some photos of wolves. Did you see those wolves out there?
*  Oh, I saw those wolves. I have wolf paw tattoo on my side.
*  Do you really? Yeah.
*  How much do you regret that? A lot or really a lot?
*  I love them.
*  People are always like, are those cat paws?
*  And I'm like, yeah, whatever.
*  That fits too.
*  That's a weird one. The dog paw tattoo. That's a common weird one.
*  Yeah. Is it?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like barbed wire.
*  Oh, yeah. I love a good barbed wire tattoo.
*  You got any barbed wire?
*  No. I got two sleeves, though.
*  Both these arms are sleeved.
*  But it's all traditional.
*  Well, it's not really traditional Japanese stuff.
*  But it's like Japanese new style American stuff.
*  No paws.
*  Not that I wouldn't have got one.
*  I'm lucky I didn't get a tattoo until I was like 25.
*  And I didn't get sleeved until I was in my 30s.
*  Because I would have made some shit choices.
*  That should be a 30s decision.
*  Oh, God. I see these kids today. They're fucking 18.
*  They got face tattoos. Like, bro, slow down.
*  It's such a fun decision to make for your whole life.
*  Like Post Malone. That kid's talented as fuck.
*  Really talented.
*  But always tired?
*  You tattooed always tired on your face?
*  Every time I see a picture of him, I get angry.
*  I just want to be like...
*  I spend...
*  I don't spend a ton of time in hair and makeup.
*  But anytime I have something,
*  I spend at least a little hair and makeup.
*  And I'm looking at this guy and I'm like...
*  Why can't we just be that?
*  Well, I think what he's doing,
*  and what a lot of people are doing,
*  is they're going way overboard to not give a fuck.
*  Just scribbling on their face.
*  Oh, yeah. Did you see the Lizzo thing from the Lakers game last night?
*  No. Did you feel that?
*  Yeah, that's the truck.
*  Happens all the time. I do too. I panicked.
*  Oh, I've never been here for an earthquake.
*  We're due. We're due for a big one.
*  I remember when they said that there was a recent shift
*  in one of the tectonic plates,
*  that it was the first time it moved in 500 years.
*  Uh-oh.
*  And they're like, oh, Jesus.
*  The other place I was thinking of moving to
*  was Bozeman, Montana.
*  You know why, Jamie?
*  Because it's right next to Yellowstone.
*  So if it blows, it blows right on your fucking head.
*  Wait. If the geyser...
*  Whoa. Do you know what Yellowstone is?
*  It's like a bunch of water under it, right?
*  Hot water?
*  Much, much, much more than that.
*  It's a continent destroyer.
*  It's a continent destroyer.
*  It's a caldera volcano.
*  They didn't find out about it until satellites...
*  Wait, is that the geyser?
*  Oh, it's way more than a geyser.
*  The geyser is there, but the geyser is a result of
*  underground volcanic activity.
*  There's a super volcano under Yellowstone
*  that's so fucking big that when they first saw
*  they didn't know what it was.
*  And then they realized it when they started looking at satellite images
*  that it's essentially what happens when a volcano
*  explodes and the mountain disappears and it becomes like a crater.
*  So the whole top just blows up.
*  And it happens every 600 to 800,000 years.
*  And the last time it happened was about 600,000 years ago.
*  They have thousands of earthquakes there.
*  And you want to live there?
*  Great place to live.
*  It's beautiful.
*  Oh, it's great out there.
*  You want to be there for the explosion?
*  Well, I feel like if it blows, you want to be there.
*  Because you don't want to be one of those people eating people.
*  Oh, that's true.
*  You don't want to die.
*  That's why I never understood
*  bomb shelters and stuff like that.
*  Preppers.
*  No, I'd rather not be around.
*  If an asteroid hits, you want it to hit you.
*  You literally want to see that giant
*  city-sized thing just coming straight at you.
*  Close your eyes and let's see what happens when you die.
*  I don't want any shrapnel.
*  I want the full asteroid to my face.
*  There's been a bunch of super volcanoes that have killed people.
*  There's one of them that we were talking about.
*  We were talking about
*  the first time we saw it.
*  We were talking about
*  what island was that, Jamie?
*  There was one that happened
*  somewhere around, I think it was Indonesia,
*  where it killed most of the population
*  on Earth.
*  It was about 70,000 years ago.
*  They were down to just a few thousand human beings.
*  Toba.
*  Is that near Indonesia? Am I making that up?
*  Sumatra.
*  Sumatra, yeah.
*  So where were the thousand people?
*  A few thousand people
*  other places other than that.
*  Because what happens is you get nuclear winter.
*  With the entire atmosphere.
*  It gets filled with volcanic dust.
*  It gets freezing cold. It blocks out the sun.
*  Animals die. Look at that bitch.
*  Woo! 75,000 years ago.
*  Look how pretty it is now!
*  It's gorgeous.
*  It's gorgeous now.
*  But when you see mountains, that's the result of activity.
*  That's the result of plates moving.
*  Shit, what's that?
*  Shit moving upwards.
*  Wait, but the people really trying not to care.
*  The Lakers game last night, Lizzo.
*  Oh, Jesus, is that her?
*  Yeah.
*  I went to the game last night and she wore this t-shirt
*  that had this big hole in the back.
*  And she was just wearing a thong out of it.
*  My theory is that she forgot underwear and then cut it.
*  And she was like, I can fashion it out of this hole.
*  But...
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's calculated.
*  First of all, she's sitting on a seat.
*  Right there?
*  Right there.
*  Her butt is on that plastic Delta court side seat.
*  Well, you know, Little Duval,
*  you know Little Duval,
*  he had a great point.
*  He put it on his Twitter page.
*  He said, how come
*  when little skinny hot girls
*  wear no clothes,
*  everybody gets mad at him and calls him sluts.
*  But when big giant girls,
*  I don't think he said big giant girls.
*  I think he just said big. I added giant.
*  He's like, when big girls dress like that, everybody celebrates.
*  Well, my biggest problem with it is that,
*  you'll see all these women, I'm sure, being like,
*  she's just confident.
*  She's confident.
*  And I'm like, why does it still have to be,
*  it doesn't matter, it's still wrapped up in women
*  needing to feel sexy to feel confident.
*  Right.
*  Or you can just be a really good artist.
*  No.
*  No, to be confident, you have to
*  stick your ass out.
*  Yeah. Super important. Yeah, it's very important.
*  That's what people do when they're confident.
*  It's like when baboons, when they're in estrus.
*  Look at her there, dancing around.
*  Well, you also got to remember,
*  she's only been getting a lot,
*  oh Jesus Christ.
*  How long has she been getting attention for?
*  It hasn't been that long.
*  I feel like I've only known about her for like a year.
*  Yeah, so this is all new.
*  Yeah, so this is all new, you know?
*  Look, she's got an old iPhone.
*  You see that iPhone? Back that up, Jamie.
*  Back that up.
*  That shit had bezels on it. Look.
*  See the bezels on that phone? Back it up.
*  See that? See the top? See the bottom?
*  She's got an old iPhone.
*  Do you? Yeah.
*  You might be one of them weird people that likes to do it as a choice.
*  I just don't want a bigger phone.
*  It doesn't fit in my pocket.
*  They're coming out with a new one, a new iPhone
*  and a real small one. A 4 inch one.
*  She called it a lady phone.
*  Lady phone.
*  For people that are tired of fucking staring at their screen all day.
*  Maybe it would be less interesting.
*  Are you one of those people that wants to get into flip phones again?
*  No, I have thought about
*  getting a flip phone
*  but the problem is everybody eye messages me.
*  Yeah.
*  I switched over to Android before, it becomes a disaster.
*  You miss half the messages.
*  Apple fucks you.
*  They're trying to keep you from switching over.
*  They're genius.
*  When they figured out the blue text too.
*  The blue bubble carries status.
*  Someone with a green bubble
*  just like
*  what's wrong with you? What are you doing?
*  Get your life together.
*  Or you're one of them tech weirdos.
*  Deep, deep, deep in tech.
*  You use Linux.
*  You're just coding all the time.
*  You have your own, you made your own phone program.
*  What do they do with their phones?
*  It's not jail breaking,
*  you do that with an iPhone.
*  Is it the same?
*  I thought it had a different name.
*  I don't think it's jail.
*  What is it called?
*  There's various words for it.
*  It depends on boot loading.
*  Something like that.
*  Basically what they do is they
*  erase everything off of the phone,
*  start fresh with a clean version of Android.
*  Then they add their own skins.
*  They add their own loaders.
*  Whatever makes them happy.
*  Launchers, they have launchers,
*  different launchers. Which launcher are you using?
*  They get really geeked out because with Android
*  you can change everything.
*  I don't care. I went back and forth.
*  I tried Android to see
*  but the Apple experience
*  is smoother.
*  I have a friend who only
*  uses an iPad and
*  can only get messages
*  when it's connected to WiFi.
*  It's very frustrating
*  when you're trying to get a hold of that person.
*  I have a friend who does that too.
*  Is it your friend Ari Shafir?
*  Ari does it too.
*  It's the same kind of thing.
*  I know another guy who does that too.
*  I bet I know who you're talking about.
*  He does that.
*  Ari is an addict.
*  He knows it.
*  He understands it.
*  I respect the fact that he
*  made a proactive move
*  to say, look, this is
*  fucking dumb.
*  I'm going to figure out a way to not stare at my phone all day.
*  I'll just get a flip phone.
*  Then he was texting with the thumbs,
*  doing that T9 thing.
*  Attelle has a flip phone.
*  He has an iPhone too.
*  Literally iPhone 2.
*  The number 2.
*  He does. It is.
*  It's a second generation iPhone.
*  It's hilarious. He pulls it out of his pocket
*  like fucking receipts
*  and diner matches.
*  He pulls this old ass iPhone.
*  Attelle is hilarious.
*  Not just hilarious as a comic, but hilarious as a human character.
*  He's one of my favorites.
*  Every once in a while he'll do a joke check
*  and you'll get this weird text from him
*  that's like, hey, does anyone have anything
*  about raccoons and cats
*  eating flags or something?
*  It's just a combination of like,
*  it's like a mad lib.
*  You're like, no, I've not heard that one before.
*  I guess when you're a guy like him too,
*  if you're writing joke jokes all the time,
*  everything's a joke joke.
*  I don't know if you've heard that before.
*  Your memory only holds so much.
*  Of course.
*  He's like,
*  he is all punch line.
*  That's all it is.
*  It's fucking the best.
*  It is one of those things where it's like,
*  does anyone have jokes about
*  s'mores and hot air balloons?
*  To me,
*  he's the most underappreciated
*  master of our age.
*  He's a legitimate
*  master comedian.
*  He doesn't get the kind of
*  love that he should from the
*  general public because he has zero
*  marketing.
*  Zero anything other than people saying
*  he's awesome and people seeing him be awesome.
*  He's one of the rare
*  guys that got sober and got better.
*  He really did.
*  Also, he'll bring candy to the club every once
*  in a while, which I love candy.
*  I'm always happy.
*  He'll just bring bags of candy to the
*  cellar every once in a while.
*  I did want a little baby Ruth.
*  Just bring candy for people?
*  He's the best.
*  Everybody loves him. Nobody will tell you they hate a tell.
*  I've never heard that once.
*  There's
*  this one story of him doing crowd work.
*  There's a group of
*  Latino women
*  in the front and
*  mean mugging the whole time, just arms
*  crossed. Enough that comics were
*  talking about it.
*  I'm like, yeah, but then there's these women in the front.
*  We couldn't break them at all.
*  A tell gets on stage, looks
*  immediately at them, and she goes,
*  he goes, oh, why so sad? Did
*  Selena die again?
*  Oh my god, that's funny.
*  Did Selena die again?
*  Everyone laughed. They laughed.
*  It's just like,
*  but he has that laser vision
*  where he sees it in the
*  crowd. He has the perfect
*  reference for it.
*  Did Selena die again?
*  Holy shit, that's funny.
*  Oh my god, that's funny.
*  They'd have to laugh at that.
*  You have to. You can't not.
*  Oh my god, that's so funny.
*  Did Selena die again?
*  Holy fuck.
*  Oh my god.
*  He's one of the greatest.
*  For sure. Like legitimately one of the greatest ever.
*  Just doesn't get enough credit.
*  And that in comedy right now too.
*  He's been around for decades and should
*  definitely be widely loved.
*  Who else?
*  Some of the younger guys too.
*  Like this Mark Norman, Sam Morrell,
*  Dan Soder, Jo Liss.
*  Soder just had a special.
*  I'm not saying they're not getting some.
*  I feel like they're all underappreciated.
*  They're guys
*  that are great joke writers.
*  And it's
*  hard for them to sell specials now.
*  People are like, you're a straight white guy.
*  Is that real?
*  I think it is, yeah.
*  But isn't like, I mean
*  there are straight white guys.
*  What's that fuck, John Mulaney.
*  He's a straight white guy.
*  Pretty sure he is.
*  But he has characteristics.
*  I mean
*  he does, he looks nice.
*  He's presentable.
*  He has a small dog.
*  But I'm pretty confident.
*  Dresses well.
*  Stylish.
*  Very good comic though.
*  I think he's just old timey.
*  That's right it is. They were gay in the old days.
*  That's why the Flintstones
*  will have a gay old time.
*  Right?
*  Oh now I just want to see a gay Flintstones
*  remake.
*  They should do that. Be inclusive.
*  Don't be bigots.
*  You're going to remake all these shows. Let's do a gay
*  Flintstone.
*  There's a guy like that today.
*  You're like, that poor guy. Come out of the closet.
*  Of course you would.
*  You're just like, no he's just a
*  straight tap dancer.
*  No chance. Who the fuck is a
*  straight tap dancer? Sorry straight tap dancers.
*  Sorry, Savion Glover.
*  There's gotta be
*  straight tap dancers. I mean they must exist.
*  But white ones?
*  White straight tap
*  dancers? I mean
*  I don't even know of white guys tap
*  dancers anymore. There's a few. There's like four.
*  Yeah? Do you know them?
*  No, they all live in Pennsylvania.
*  They're all thinking of getting out. That's where I'm from.
*  My parents used to live outside
*  of Wilkes-Barre. Really? I'm from
*  Hershey. Oh shit. Yeah. Boy it smells
*  out there. Cows, right?
*  So in town it would
*  either smell like chocolate because of the factory
*  or poop. Cows or
*  chocolate. Boy that's a
*  confusing way to grow up. Yeah it really is.
*  How many people live in Hershey?
*  I think it's like 30,000
*  maybe. You get about 30,000
*  deer around there too. Yeah, a lot of
*  deer. We have a day off of school for deer hunting.
*  Oh, day off school? Really? Yeah. It was always the
*  Monday after Thanksgiving. That's when deer season started.
*  Pennsylvania. I mean a lot of
*  venison. I bet you have. Yeah. You want
*  some? I got some. I'm good right now. Okay.
*  I used to
*  eat venison bologna.
*  Venison bologna is delicious. It's really good. Yeah.
*  You get used
*  to eating wild game and you start preferring it.
*  I prefer it.
*  I have a lot of people I know that
*  hunt out there. They're bow and arrow hunters. Yeah.
*  Which I kind of appreciate that a lot.
*  That's what I do. Yeah, really? Yeah, that's all I do.
*  I haven't hunted with a rifle
*  in years. Do you have to
*  wait for a long time for things? It's
*  harder. It's more nerve
*  racking. It's more difficult to make a good
*  shot. It's
*  requires way more practice.
*  Like you could, if you know how
*  to shoot a gun, like if I had a good
*  rest with a rifle, I haven't shot, well I
*  shot a rifle a couple months ago, but if
*  I hadn't
*  shot a rifle, like I shot an elk
*  once and I hadn't shot a rifle in a year.
*  Yeah. And all
*  if you have a rest and the rifle
*  is on the rest and the rest is steady,
*  all it is about trigger discipline. It's just squeeze,
*  squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, boom. Let it go
*  off on its own. Just don't jerk the trigger.
*  Keep the crosshair on the animal and it's
*  not that hard. Right.
*  But bow hunting is like a lifestyle.
*  It's a different thing. For the guys who do it,
*  it's like when you eat something, like
*  we ate elk last night in my house.
*  I shot that elk with a bow
*  and arrow in Utah. You know, like
*  I was there. I saw everything.
*  I cut it up. Do you
*  butcher it yourself? I didn't butcher it myself,
*  but we quartered it, which means you take
*  the legs off and the back straps off
*  and you take all the big parts of meat. And then I send
*  it to a butcher and they'll make sausages
*  and cut it into roasts. Yeah. How do you get the
*  elk back to California? Cooler.
*  Just like freeze it on the plane?
*  Yep. Yeah. Yeti.
*  Yeti coolers. They have these things called
*  a Yeti Hopper. So it's
*  like a bag, like a big bag, like about
*  this big. And you can get two back straps
*  in there from an elk. Elk back straps.
*  You know, elk's a big animal. It's an 800 pound animal.
*  I just love the idea that there's all these people
*  on planes with like,
*  they're going to LA with their little dog
*  and they're like, and there's just
*  like elk meat in storage.
*  Yeah, I put it in the overhead.
*  You put it in the overhead? Yeah. Yeah.
*  Wait, for real. For real.
*  You have elk meat. 100%.
*  That's great. That's how I carry it back.
*  I love this. Yeah. Well, you have to
*  look, if you, I could either
*  send all of it to the back straps.
*  What happens when you put it through security?
*  Are they like, what's going on here? Oh, you got an elk.
*  Oh really? Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, they know
*  places like Utah, they're used to that.
*  I mean, this makes me so mad because I
*  had an Alexander McQueen purse. You know
*  the ones, you guys know Alexander McQueen
*  purses, right? You're familiar
*  with the line. They have ones
*  that have like rings that you like,
*  you put your hand through and it's like a bunch of rings
*  attached to the purse.
*  Well, I brought it through security
*  and they were like, no, you have
*  to check this because it looks like
*  brass knuckles. Oh, come on.
*  So I had to check my
*  McQueen purse, my little
*  quilted patent leather McQueen
*  purse. That is so ridiculous. And you can bring
*  elk. Well, Tony Hinchcliffe tried
*  to bring a pool stick. We went to
*  this is what's, here's what's really
*  crazy. We went to Phoenix this
*  past weekend. We were working together and
*  my friend Scott Frost has a, shout
*  out to Scott Frost, has a place
*  in Tempe, this big pool hall. Scott's
*  like a big time
*  gambler, pool player,
*  professional pool player, very famous guy
*  in the world of pool. And so we were going to go
*  and play at his place and so Tony brought
*  his pool cue and in LA
*  he didn't even check it. He just
*  walked right through security with a pool cue.
*  Pool cue is totally illegal to bring on a
*  plane. So we're walking around LAX
*  and I go, hey man, you have a fucking pool
*  cue with you? He goes, yeah. I go, how did you do that?
*  He goes, I just walked right through.
*  I go, what? He goes, yeah, I just walked
*  through. I go, dude, that's illegal. You can't have that.
*  He goes, I'm pretty sure it's legal now. So
*  on the way back from Phoenix
*  they were like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  He's like, oh, I'm just going to bring the pool cue on the plane. I was like,
*  no you're not. Go check that shit. So he had to go
*  back out. We had to hold on to his bags.
*  He went back out and he had to go back to the counter
*  and check it and come back. Wait, why is
*  it so illegal? Because you could poke someone
*  to death with it. Oh, right. I was thinking poke.
*  I guess you could do that too.
*  You just, you go up to the
*  the, you somehow get into
*  the cockpit and you're just like
*  poking the back of their heads. We're going to
*  Egypt. They annoy me so much.
*  He made us fly to Miami.
*  No, it's a hardwood club.
*  Basically. Oh, that's, yeah, I'm
*  dumb. That's a better, that would be a better way
*  to use a weapon. How many of you watch a Steven Seagal
*  movie? Oh, right.
*  It gets people up with pool cues.
*  Waaah. Yeah.
*  But there's so much stuff like that.
*  Like, oh yeah. Well, they sell glass
*  bottles. Yeah. Inside the terminal.
*  Which you could break.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And then have a glass weapon.
*  Right, but don't they hold those?
*  Like when you have duty free, don't they hold on
*  to that stuff and then you get it later or something? I think you can buy glass bottles of like,
*  like sparkling water.
*  In like, in
*  throughout the thing. I think you can.
*  Yeah, you definitely can buy a bottle of
*  water, like a water bottle.
*  But can you buy like a Voss bottle?
*  I think so. I've never seen one. I think they
*  have the little glass sparkling ones.
*  I might be wrong. We might both be full
*  of shit here. Yeah. Let's fight it out.
*  I brought a big, big fucking
*  knife once on a plane. Really?
*  Right through security at LAX. Again, with a big
*  No! My friend
*  Jaco gave me this knife. Shout out to
*  Jaco. He gave me this knife and I had it in my
*  fanny pack and it just went right through security.
*  And then I saw a fucking click.
*  A big hefty knife. Yeah.
*  And I was like, whoa.
*  I got, got back to
*  my place and you know, it's like
*  I was in my hotel room and then I noticed I
*  had it. I was like, holy shit. Well, look
*  I get excited when I can get hair product
*  through.
*  What's the rule on hair products?
*  Well, it's supposed to be under whatever three ounces
*  but every once in a while I'll forget or like
*  I'll be like running late and I'll throw in like
*  the full size bottle. Crazy.
*  And luckily a lot of times it'll be
*  like black women that'll be like
*  they'll see it and they'll be like, no, it's fine.
*  Go ahead. I'll be like, thank you so much. Oh my god.
*  Well, they know you're not a fucking terrorist.
*  It's so ridiculous. And also
*  it's hard to find, you know,
*  the right hair product.
*  In some of the places we go. They were going to let people bring
*  knives again. They were going to let people bring
*  four inch knives and they were going to
*  let people bring pool cues. But then I
*  think something happened and there was
*  another event. Oh,
*  you know what it was? You remember at LAX
*  where that guy shot one of the TSA
*  agents? Like came to LAX
*  with a rifle and
*  shot a TSA agent. That's
*  right when that was going down.
*  Then they locked it down. So if I was a conspiracy
*  theorist, I would say they don't want
*  us bringing little knives and pool cues. So
*  they shot that guy. It's a false flag.
*  I mean, it
*  it's logical though. I can
*  follow the logic.
*  It's just what
*  you can and can't bring is crazy.
*  How come you can bring a skateboard? I could beat
*  someone to death with a skateboard. Oh yeah.
*  Way better than a pool cue.
*  Also it's like you couldn't
*  just have a bunch of three ounce things that you combine
*  together. Yeah, make a big bomb.
*  Yeah, you have a bunch of three ounce things
*  in an empty tub. What's the empty tub for?
*  Why does it have a fuse? You don't know this is
*  poison. Right, it could be
*  anything. Right, like those little
*  you could definitely take something
*  and I probably shouldn't say this.
*  I don't want to give anybody any ideas.
*  What if I did say that and then
*  someone did do that? See, there's a
*  lot of people that are really crazy and
*  not that creative. Right.
*  Yeah, they're just
*  like, if only I knew a way to
*  do this. It's like, use your brain buddy. Like the shoe
*  bomber? That fucking asshole.
*  Now everybody has to take their shoes off.
*  Nobody took their shoes off before that. Because he had a bad
*  shoe bomb. It was terrible.
*  But he was trying to light it in front of everybody.
*  He didn't even do it in the bathroom, the fucking
*  idiot.
*  Is that what you do, you light bombs?
*  If I was going to light a bomb, I'd light it in the bathroom.
*  Yeah. I would.
*  Just light it.
*  Flush it.
*  And then, oh, of the plane. And then start walking.
*  Like you don't even know what's happening.
*  Like one of the action movies where the bomb goes off behind you.
*  That's what you do, just walk.
*  Just walk down the aisle.
*  You're just hoping someone Instagrams it at the right time too.
*  You're like, oh, we're all going to die. But also
*  what a good post.
*  But also, hopefully your phone is really
*  durable. It makes the trip.
*  It fell from the sky.
*  And we did get this
*  amazing action photo.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a weird thing that
*  everybody gets super, super checked
*  flying. But you don't get super, super
*  checked when you go to the mall. You don't get
*  super, super checked. There's all these other places
*  where you don't get super, super checked.
*  Yeah. I mean, I feel like there should just
*  be metal detectors everywhere.
*  How hard is it to get on a train?
*  Very easy.
*  I love an Amtrak.
*  Do you take guns? Well, I don't have any.
*  But if you had, you would? Yeah, you could.
*  Poison? Do you have poison?
*  Only if I'm trying to kill somebody.
*  But yeah, you can just get on.
*  You can get to the train station
*  if you're there like a minute before the train
*  leaves, you can get on the train.
*  There's nothing. They don't
*  look for anything. Yeah, you just hop on.
*  You hop right on. You ride the rails.
*  You get to look at the beautiful scenery.
*  I love a train. I do love a train.
*  We took a train in Europe. I was with my family
*  in Italy and we took a train ride.
*  They do trains really well. It was great.
*  It was beautiful. Sit back,
*  watch the countryside,
*  drink a Diet Coke.
*  It was wonderful.
*  In the UK, they have like really
*  good service on trains too. If you take one
*  of the Virgin trains or whatever,
*  they come through and they have snacks.
*  Imagine being like in the old
*  West times when they had those really nice
*  first class trains that were going
*  across the country. Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga.
*  And everyone's dressed like a gentleman and a
*  lady. Yeah, and you're just like
*  everyone looks beautiful.
*  Everything's velvet. Yeah,
*  velvet. Yeah. Velvet was classic.
*  They really liked velvet.
*  Why was that, you think?
*  I think it probably just felt soft and maybe it was expensive.
*  And it just showed
*  that you were wealthy. And then all the
*  stains too. Do you know that they used to use
*  beaver pelts
*  to like line the inside of their hats?
*  Really? Yeah, like that
*  was like a big thing. Like beavers would line the inside
*  of the hats. And there was
*  something about the inside of hats that
*  they used mercury.
*  And the mercury made people
*  go crazy. Yeah, I was going to say
*  that sounds like a bad idea. So that's where the
*  expression mad hatter came from.
*  Really? Mad as a hatter. Yeah. It came from
*  people not knowing that mercury
*  was poison. So they were putting mercury
*  in their fucking hats. This is how like
*  I'm just like, yeah
*  100%. I'm pretty sure that's true. I 100%
*  believe you.
*  It sounds ridiculous. Is that true? I think it's
*  totally true, right? I definitely think someone told
*  me that on this podcast. I have my
*  hard drive is so
*  over full. So over
*  full. Like I run into
*  people and I go, oh I
*  know that guy. I'm like fuck he was on my podcast a month
*  ago. Of course I know him.
*  Literally it's like I'm forgetting
*  everything. I wonder if it's just getting old.
*  This is
*  something crazy? Yeah, alright. So
*  this is the explanation I just read on this. Corrosion
*  doctors dot org which I don't know
*  the validity of it. But
*  so it was camel hair that was used
*  as the felt material. In order to soften
*  it up and speed up the softening process
*  they would use camel urine to process
*  that. So as that became
*  more popular, the French
*  workmen that were doing
*  that would use their own urine to soften
*  it. Some of them
*  were being treated for syphilis
*  with mercury.
*  Whoa. That would
*  then bleed into and lead to
*  some problems. How did you get some syphilis piss
*  on the inside of your fancy hat? Sounds like a lot
*  to get to there. This is what you get for having sex
*  outside of marriage.
*  That's what I'm saying. Or even inside of marriage.
*  Imagine if you wait all those days and she still
*  gives you the clap. Like fuck.
*  God damn it.
*  They might have even used the mercury to process it
*  and skipped all the pee process but
*  that's the first paragraph says it was
*  urine that did it and then
*  That's crazy. Yeah, I mean I think I'd rather
*  wear my own pee than a camel's pee.
*  Yeah, or
*  a dude with syphilis. Yeah.
*  Did you see the pictures of people when they used to die from syphilis?
*  No.
*  It's a rough way to go. You get holes
*  in your head. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, your nose
*  falls off. It's fucking horrific.
*  Maybe that's what Michael Jackson had.
*  I don't think so. People develop
*  big holes in their skin.
*  There's this one guy, Lindsay Fitzharris
*  that's her name, right?
*  She's a woman who's got
*  this amazing Instagram page.
*  And she specializes
*  in ancient medical
*  procedures. She shows you the horrors
*  of ancient surgery.
*  And one of the things she was showing us
*  was photos of people who died from
*  syphilis.
*  Oh, here's another one. Old medicine
*  is terrifying.
*  Oh, terrifying.
*  Like, I just don't even know who became doctors
*  back then. They were like, I got this crazy idea
*  that'll get rid of your blood and it's just
*  more like...
*  They just practice on people. Well, that's where wigs
*  came from. You know, like when you used to see old
*  rich dudes wearing wigs?
*  That was from syphilis. People had syphilis.
*  Oh, you mean our founding fathers?
*  This lady's face is falling off from syphilis.
*  Oh, jeez. Shouldn't be a whore.
*  Yeah, well, you know what?
*  Look at that one down the middle. Look at that guy in the middle
*  with his nose. That's from syphilis.
*  And he's still alive? Or is he dead there?
*  No, he's dying.
*  He's not still alive today.
*  But look at him. He looks like...
*  Look at his right eye. His left eye
*  is still normal. He's probably like, I shouldn't have fucked that whore.
*  That's one of those things that...
*  Look at him. He's like, God damn it.
*  Came to me like I got a fucking hole in my head.
*  He's just like...
*  He just keeps walking around being like, it was worth it.
*  Yes. Oh, yeah.
*  I came so hard.
*  Fuck this face.
*  But the wig thing came
*  from France. It came from...
*  That's why, like, the expression
*  big wig. The
*  more money you had, the bigger the wig you got.
*  And it all came from these
*  royal guys. I think they were cousins.
*  But they had syphilis.
*  Their fucking hair was falling out. So they had wigs
*  made. And so because these guys were the shit,
*  they were basically the male Kardashians of the day,
*  everybody started copying them.
*  And people, probably a bunch of other people had syphilis as well.
*  Their hair was falling out. So they all got wigs.
*  So when you see a bunch of people
*  in the old days that were
*  in court, and how
*  the judge and everyone would
*  wear powdered wigs, all that
*  started because of syphilis.
*  You know, that's first of all
*  hilarious to think that everyone was
*  in court when they're like, so how's your syphilis?
*  They didn't even know what it was.
*  They barely knew what syphilis was. I got a hole in the head.
*  I got a nose-gum disease.
*  I just lost all my hair, but
*  look at this wig. I'm pimping.
*  There's also, do you know, you ever watch, like, British
*  crime dramas? Yes. I have.
*  They still wear those wigs.
*  For court. For court. Yeah.
*  I'm basing
*  British crime dramas on what I think they actually still
*  do in Britain. I wonder if they do. I feel like they do it on TV.
*  They must still do it. They must.
*  In court. I wonder when they stop
*  doing it over here. When they're like, enough.
*  I wonder who's the last guy to wear a wig. Fuck you,
*  I'm keeping it. Who was the last guy
*  who kept the powdered wig over here?
*  Yeah, like, he was, it was definitely a bald guy.
*  He was like, look, look, look.
*  Look at these assholes. Oh my
*  God, that is crazy. Those are
*  terrible wigs, too.
*  Those are not even kind of wigs.
*  It's like a hat. It looks like a little carpet.
*  Yeah, it doesn't look like anybody's head.
*  It looks like a little floor mat. Like a sheep.
*  That's like a really well
*  cared for and groomed sheep.
*  Like when someone loves their sheep
*  and they brush it. My uncle's a sheep
*  farmer. For real? For real. In Pennsylvania?
*  In Ohio. Really? Yeah.
*  Wow. Yeah. He one time.
*  Look at these guys. This is today.
*  They're Tories. Yeah.
*  What's a Tory? Is that a lawyer? It's
*  one of their parties. Look at
*  the fucking, look at those guys
*  wearing those stupid wigs and everybody
*  else is modern behind them and around.
*  They're just wearing a wig, but they
*  also pull out their phone.
*  They got that stupid old wig on.
*  What's that? A little white bow tie they have to
*  wear, too. Oh, a little white bow tie. What's
*  going on in the back of his head? The guy on the far right?
*  What is that? It looks like a tail. Like he's got a rat
*  tail. Is that other guy? That's something Peter Vaughan would have.
*  Is the guy behind him picking his nose?
*  I hope so. Yes,
*  he is. Yes, he is. You're
*  correct. That's why
*  you don't get a wig, sir.
*  Dirty fuck picking your nose. What happened
*  to the picture? I accidentally dragged it and it disappeared.
*  Yeah, so
*  this is fairly recent. I mean, it's modern
*  color photography. Yeah.
*  I'm pretty sure they still do it.
*  This is 2019. So look at the old picture
*  down there, the painting, the far
*  bottom of the screen, right there.
*  Look at that. That's what they used to do.
*  Look at these weirdos.
*  Kind of looks like my hair. Ho ho.
*  He's got a syphilis scar on his face. He's got
*  a hole. You look into his cheek.
*  Oh, God. But he's still probably nutting in people.
*  Everything sexual back then had to be
*  terrible. Oh, disgusting.
*  The smells. Oh, there's so
*  many smells.
*  But people get horny enough they don't care about
*  smells. That's why dudes in prison
*  fuck dudes. They get to the point they're like
*  who cares? God, I can't
*  imagine. Well, it's
*  like you only, we
*  have standards until
*  like you get desperate.
*  You have standards until you don't have options.
*  Yes. Oh, that's a perfect way to phrase it.
*  You nailed it. Quotes.
*  You have standards until you don't have options.
*  Yeah, that's true. It's like
*  people get, look at these guys.
*  What the hell? African judges
*  still wear wigs. I just kept scrolling
*  and they started getting weirder. What is this? Well, hold on.
*  This might be some social justice warrior
*  stuff. Click on that. Why African judges
*  still wearing wigs is a glaring
*  symbol of
*  British colon, well, of course it is, right?
*  But also, if they still want to wear them,
*  let them wear them.
*  Stop it, opinion Britney
*  or whoever this is.
*  Look at how they did the top
*  though. They kind of like fluffed out the
*  top. They made it a little different. Yeah.
*  Had their own twist to it. Yeah, you gotta put your
*  own style. But I guess
*  like having a judge
*  wear, like today, why do they wear
*  those stupid fucking robes? Those are outdated.
*  We're making fun of wigs, but we're not
*  making fun of these goddamn wizard robes they wear.
*  Yeah, the robes are weird too. Like the Supreme
*  Court, they still wear the robes.
*  What do the women wear? Do they wear that? Look at this guy.
*  Hey, what's up? That guy
*  looks like a... He didn't want it that long.
*  A little tight.
*  I'm pretty sure that's a character from an Eddie Murphy movie.
*  He's got a nice watch though. Look, he's got
*  a nice watch, fat ring.
*  I think they wear...
*  I think they...
*  Do they wear the robes so that you can't
*  tell, like... If they're
*  beaten off? Yeah.
*  You can't tell if they have a boner?
*  I think they wear the robes to
*  symbolize that there's something special.
*  That they're much more
*  important than you. I was thinking it was like to hide
*  any sort of affiliation to
*  anything.
*  That would be the charitable way of looking at it.
*  I think they wear the robes because they're
*  mystical. Like they're the ones who are...
*  They have control of the law. Right. We
*  understand. We rule.
*  Bang, bang, bang. They have a hammer. I would be
*  a terrible judge. Cause I wouldn't
*  be able to just... I wouldn't just...
*  I'd be like, no, I just don't like this guy.
*  You'd be a comedy judge.
*  There was a bunch of those shows where they were trying to
*  do them with comedians. I actually did a pilot once.
*  Way back in the day.
*  Where it was like a
*  comedy court.
*  I would love if we had comedy
*  court. The idea was that you were going to
*  bring people in with like
*  disputes like, you know, you stole his records,
*  that kind of shit. And then I would
*  have to make a judgment. And the judgment
*  actually would stick. So people that had like small
*  claims, they would go there. Right.
*  And I think Donna Rara did one too.
*  I think Donna Rara did a pilot
*  for one of those. There was a few of those floating
*  around for a while. I think it would be fun
*  if we had comedy court now, but like
*  in the way where a lot of us comedians
*  got to decide if you get to stay
*  in comedy or not.
*  It's like, no, no, you've been
*  doing too much social justice stuff.
*  You're
*  barred for the next six months.
*  Get back to writing jokes.
*  If you criticize someone for something
*  and then we can pull up you doing that
*  exact same kind of joke.
*  Like if you get real social justice
*  about a bit and then we go
*  oh look at this. Ten years ago
*  you fuck. You did the exact
*  same jokes. I mean that's what people do on Twitter
*  all the time. Oh yeah. They're just like
*  favorite. It's so great because people are like
*  I can't believe you do this so
*  racist. And then of course minutes
*  later it's like, again,
*  so were these times you used the N word back
*  in 2012.
*  Well back in the early days
*  of Twitter no one totally understood
*  what it was. Well for me
*  it was, I still had a day
*  job and I used it every day.
*  I just wrote jokes all of the
*  time. Just like constantly
*  I'd read news stories and I practiced
*  joke writing. I had five
*  followers and I was brand new to
*  stand up. You know like it was nothing.
*  And then
*  it became a place of importance and I was like
*  I gotta delete everything.
*  Once you start getting actual gigs
*  like oh no this could fuck me. And then
*  you gotta wonder like today
*  people just store
*  and wait. They'll store and
*  wait for you to get something. Oh
*  Comedy Central wants to give you a show. I wonder if they know
*  about this. Michelle
*  you fucking piece of shit.
*  Look what you said. It's like
*  come on. Yeah. Well
*  it's also
*  back then no one understood
*  what it was. Right. Like they didn't
*  understand what they were doing. So it's like you thought
*  you were talking shit to friends. Right.
*  It's like Ashton Kutcher was like the
*  first, first guy
*  with Twitter. Yeah. Like
*  we didn't think, no one knew
*  and that was during
*  the heyday of punked. You know
*  like we didn't know this was going to turn
*  into a thing where
*  you know it would cause like a
*  what was it the spring rebellion in Egypt
*  or whatever. You remember when
*  it would be your at like at
*  Michelle Wolf is eating pizza.
*  Like you would say that you would
*  it was a weird way of communicating. You wouldn't say
*  just stuff. You would always
*  say the at thing is
*  doing something. Right. It was real
*  weird. Like Jamie Vernon
*  is working right now. Right. Like that
*  would be a real tweet. It was like a status update.
*  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It was weird. And then you know
*  somewhere along the line it was this guy touched my
*  tit. What? What happened? Yeah.
*  And then it became like a reporting
*  and then it was like news. Like if some
*  there was like a you know some breaking
*  some rebellion
*  in some foreign country. People would be
*  tweeting updates and do you
*  pay attention to Hong Kong? Yes.
*  Holy shit. The videos
*  from Hong Kong they have not stopped.
*  Yeah. They're still going strong.
*  The thing, the crazy thing is like you
*  you heard a little bit about it in America
*  and then when the NBA stuff happened
*  they were finally like
*  then everyone heard about Hong Kong
*  and you were like wait it took a
*  basketball to get this to make
*  the news and even then it was still
*  sports center. Well it was people
*  didn't want to criticize China. Look at that. Look
*  at that fucking photo. But also I got to say again
*  shout out to China is
*  as soon as the basketball stuff
*  started happening the next morning they were painting
*  over murals and taking
*  things down. I was like these guys
*  do not fuck around. What was the
*  controversy? It was one of the
*  it was like a GM or something from the Houston Rockets.
*  He tweeted something in
*  support of the Hong Kong protests
*  and China immediately
*  was like
*  nope no more NBA. We're not
*  putting it on the TV.
*  And the thing is a lot of NBA players have like huge
*  shoe deals and like other
*  endorsement deals in China.
*  And like they might have
*  an entirely separate shoe deal
*  in China that's making them millions of dollars.
*  And so the players were sort of like
*  hey
*  let's backtrack on this
*  a little bit. They did backtrack right?
*  Yeah. And then. Human rights are not that important.
*  What's really important is Nikes.
*  Listen I got it.
*  China is at least a little bit
*  upfront that they don't care about human rights.
*  Sort of right?
*  Like here we kind of like gloss over it.
*  We're like it's like we go like
*  an extra step to pretend that we care about
*  human rights but we're not
*  we're not the best at it either.
*  We're not the best.
*  But we might be the best.
*  Of the big countries?
*  I don't know. Who's better?
*  Canada? Canada. Maybe. But they're weird.
*  They have human rights like
*  well they also have stuff like you're not allowed to
*  yeah you're not you can get in trouble
*  for saying stuff. Yes. Well you know
*  that kid Mike Ward? That comic?
*  Comic? Yeah. He just lost
*  his case. Where he's supposed to
*  pay $35,000
*  because he made a joke about
*  there was a kid who was sick
*  and everybody donated
*  money and then like a bunch
*  of years later the kid was still alive
*  and he made a joke like can I get my
*  fucking money back? How's that kid still alive?
*  See?
*  It was a pretty good joke.
*  I mean obviously he didn't really
*  mean it. It's not a statement.
*  He's not saying this like
*  he's being funny. He's being a stand up comedian.
*  That's what he does. And they
*  fucking sued him and they won. And so
*  this has been going on forever. Mike was on my podcast
*  two years ago?
*  Three years? How many years ago Jamie?
*  I don't think it was at this spot. Was it?
*  I think it was the old spot.
*  It was a year ago? Okay so
*  it was at this spot. And
*  it was still going on. And he just
*  recently lost. So
*  it started I believe two years
*  before that. So it's been going
*  on for several years. You and Ari actually talked about
*  it in 2016
*  or something. Yeah. I remember
*  there was one year at Montreal that people were talking
*  about it. Yes. It was a big deal.
*  Canada's weird. There was another comic who got
*  heckled by this
*  they were in
*  I think this was in Vancouver. And they were
*  at a Yuck Yucks I think.
*  Maybe I'm making this up. I don't remember where it was.
*  But someone was on
*  stage and this
*  lesbian couple was heckling. And they were
*  heckling a bunch of comedians. He got up and
*  called them a bunch of dykes and said some crazy
*  shit to them. And
*  they fucking. I was like heckles out
*  of context are so funny.
*  It was lesbian. Caught them a bunch of dykes.
*  You're like.
*  Well you know people get
*  drunk and they yell stuff out
*  at comedy clubs and it was disruptive.
*  So that
*  comic wound up having to pay money too.
*  That comic got sued.
*  I think he lost I want to say
*  it was a lot of money. I want to say it was like
*  $100,000 or something crazy. That's crazy.
*  It's also like
*  I don't know. I don't like anytime
*  a comic is taken seriously.
*  Yeah. Well in that time. See the thing is
*  heckles. It's like
*  is this comedy anymore? Like what's going
*  on here? Is someone just. Is someone's
*  yelling at you while you're on stage.
*  They're disrupting your work. Right.
*  And then your job is to make fun of them.
*  But if you just decide listen you fucking
*  fat slob. Yeah. Oh my god
*  he called me fat. Like
*  is that funny? Also are
*  you fat? Are you fat?
*  Are you a big old bulldog?
*  Did you hear about Elon's case that he
*  won? This is kind of the same topic because
*  it was basically they were arguing that was a joke.
*  Oh right. Not serious.
*  You know why Elon won?
*  Because he's got $28 billion.
*  That's why he won. And because
*  wherever that dude was in Thailand
*  they want some dope cars.
*  He's like oh I'll make you a deal. He's like I'll give you those
*  trucks. Totally cool. I promise their windows
*  don't break. Have you ever seen Kyle Dunnigan's
*  face? Do you know Kyle Dunnigan's
*  face swap videos with Elon?
*  Yeah. Holy shit they're good.
*  I love everything Kyle does. He's the best.
*  He's so funny. The best Instagram page by far.
*  One of my favorites is when he does the
*  What's Up Chicken Butt to his mom.
*  How about Katty Daddy?
*  Katty Daddy is so funny.
*  With Annie Letterman. Holy shit is it funny.
*  Annie plays his daughter and he plays this
*  like weirdly effeminate
*  probably gay dad.
*  But he talks about having sex with women.
*  But he's like always
*  gossipy about like
*  celebrities and stuff. Oh my god
*  it's so funny. It's so perfect.
*  But it's Caitlyn Jenner's the best.
*  That's the coupe de gras.
*  I love it. You know, Commie Central
*  this is how fucking
*  goofy they are over there. They were
*  going to give him a show.
*  Like a face swap show. He's going to do
*  a face swap show. It would have been the best fucking show
*  on their network. But they were
*  so bad in terms of
*  like cutting controversial stuff out.
*  He had Caitlyn Jenner fucking Donald Trump.
*  Like she was riding Donald
*  Trump. You know because he does a great Donald Trump too.
*  And he showed it to me.
*  I was in tears. In tears. He goes
*  they cut this. I go what?
*  He goes they said no to this. I go
*  no. He goes yes.
*  What was the reason behind it? Too controversial.
*  You can't make fun of trans people.
*  But you're not making fun of
*  trans people. Trans people are allowed to have sex with the president too.
*  No, no, no.
*  You're mocking trans.
*  You're mocking people. I think you're
*  lifting up trans people.
*  Yeah, because she's on top. She's fucking
*  the shit out of Trump. She's fucking Trump.
*  I think that's a pretty good look
*  for a trans person.
*  It's not the worst look. Yeah.
*  It could be worse.
*  And I think he
*  she was a Republican.
*  Yeah, Caitlyn's a Republican.
*  My favorite part was when
*  there was the whole thing I was
*  when all this was going on and she was winning
*  woman of the year. I go do you understand
*  that she's against gay marriage?
*  And gay friends of mine were like what?
*  I go do you understand this?
*  Do you understand this?
*  I want you to stop and pause
*  before you decide this is a hero.
*  I want you to look into this. This is a moron.
*  You have a moron who just happens to be
*  transgender. And just because she's a famous moron
*  does not mean she's anything other than a moron.
*  Yeah, yeah. She's still
*  she's still not good.
*  No, her fucking this is her response.
*  Why are you against gay marriage?
*  Well, I guess I'm just kind of a traditional girl.
*  She really said that.
*  I, this is
*  This is where I wish we could get to with some of this stuff.
*  Is that you can be like yes
*  you have I appreciate and
*  respect everything about you being able to be
*  trans. I do not like you.
*  You're still, it's not because
*  you're trans. It has nothing to do with you being trans.
*  I don't like you as a person.
*  I think you're a bad person.
*  I don't know if she's a bad person. I just think she's kind of a dumb.
*  But that's where I wish we could get to.
*  Where it's like, no, no, no.
*  This isn't about being anything, whatever
*  the hot button issue that you are.
*  It's like, no, you're just still a shitty person.
*  Well, this is where
*  the loophole has gone into women in
*  sports. That's where it's gone in.
*  This drives me crazy. It should drive you crazy.
*  It drives me crazy too.
*  Biological women are getting fucked.
*  They're getting fucked over. And they're not getting fucked like Trump with
*  Kaitlyn on top.
*  They're getting fucked the worst way.
*  And they're finally starting to step back.
*  The Olympic weightlifting,
*  the people who do powerlifting terms,
*  they stopped it. They won't let transgender
*  women enter in and pretend
*  to be a biological woman anymore.
*  Well, and there's one thing that like women have to
*  in order to like fight this correctly,
*  women have to admit that men are
*  physically stronger than us.
*  And they 100% are. Men are stronger than
*  women. But that's a crazy thing to say.
*  That's like admitting that women can have babies
*  and men can't. It's like these are biological
*  facts. Of course. But there's a thing, like
*  I mean, I've gotten into fights with people about
*  Serena Williams and they're saying like, well, she could
*  be any man. And I'm like, she literally can't.
*  She can't. The last time she,
*  I'm not saying she's not great, but the last time
*  she played against a man,
*  he was like some guy who
*  drinks and like, he was like
*  rake 600th was like drinking whatever.
*  He stomped her. And she still lost.
*  And this was back a couple years ago when she was like
*  really at her peak.
*  It's not fair.
*  Like I say this all the time, it's like, I love track.
*  Right? But
*  in high jump, the best woman in the world
*  right now is jumping about 6'7".
*  The best man in the world
*  is jumping 7'11".
*  That's close.
*  Close enough. Let her in. Put a skirt on her.
*  You know who else is jumping 6'7"?
*  My friend Graham when we were in high school.
*  He's an architect now.
*  Really? He jumped 6'7"?
*  He jumped 6'7". And he was a good high jumper.
*  He went to a D1 school for it.
*  But like he...
*  He would have been a world record holder if he was a woman.
*  World record holder.
*  Well that's happening now. You're getting world record holders now
*  in weightlifting in particular.
*  Where they're trans women. It's ridiculous.
*  It was in fighting for a while.
*  There was a girl who
*  was a man for 32 years, became
*  a woman for two,
*  and then started fighting women without telling them
*  that she used to be a woman.
*  So I came out against it and all these people
*  were fucking mad at me.
*  I mean dozens of articles written about what a piece of shit I was.
*  And I was like, whoa.
*  Because I didn't understand how far
*  this whole PC progressive culture
*  had gotten in terms of completely off the rails
*  and not looking at things
*  accurately. I was like, come on.
*  You gotta be objective. I'm not saying people can't be trans.
*  But what I'm saying is you can't
*  not tell someone...
*  By the way, I'm 100% for
*  a woman fighting a man
*  if she wants to. If they weigh the same
*  and she decides... I don't think it's smart.
*  I think it's very dangerous.
*  But some women can. There's a woman who's fighting for the title
*  this weekend, Jermaine Duran Demi.
*  She's a... See if you can find the
*  video of Jermaine Duran Demi fucking this
*  dude up. She's a beast.
*  But she's a multiple time world
*  kickboxing champion, Muay Thai champion.
*  She's a fucking savage.
*  And she's fighting for the Bantamwe title
*  this weekend in Vegas. This is her. This is her
*  fucking up a dude. See now this...
*  She just calculatedly decided
*  that she was a better fighter
*  than this guy and knew
*  that... Look at this. Fucking this dude up.
*  But he's trying. He still clubbed her in the
*  back of the head there.
*  Dangerous. Fucking dangerous.
*  See, he's getting in trouble for clubbing
*  her in the back of the head. But she
*  had a boxing match with this guy
*  and fucking flattened him.
*  How is that guy ranked?
*  I don't know. I don't know the specifics
*  behind it. But it's super risky
*  for a woman to fight a man.
*  But she wanted the challenge
*  and I completely support it.
*  Go to where she flattens him.
*  See, this dude is...
*  It's fucking dangerous. But she's a
*  super high level fighter.
*  Boom! Right there, son.
*  Out go the lights.
*  You just got flatlined by a woman, kid.
*  Watch that again. Back that up again.
*  But this is a...
*  You're talking about a guy who's just a schmoe.
*  I mean, not a bad fighter.
*  Knows how to punch.
*  But that's a world champion.
*  If Jermaine Duran wants to do that,
*  I wouldn't say she couldn't do it.
*  You do whatever you want. But the idea
*  that you can not tell someone
*  that you were a man for 30 years...
*  I got into a conversation
*  with this on Twitter back when I used to get into
*  conversations with people.
*  This lady actually said this to me.
*  She goes, she's always
*  been a woman. And I go, even when
*  she fathered a child,
*  and she goes, even then, I go, we're done.
*  We're done. We're in crazy town. Now you're just making
*  things up.
*  Yes, maybe she was always a woman mentally,
*  but physically, you
*  weren't. So, it's the same
*  thing. What does that mean, mentally?
*  What does that mean? I don't know. I guess like,
*  you felt inside that you
*  were always supposed to be a woman.
*  I think you're probably saying the wrong
*  words anyway. But now she's a lesbian. So she's
*  into women. Yeah, I mean,
*  it's... Hello. It's such a complicated...
*  What are we doing?
*  And the thing is, this is what bothers me,
*  is that you can't even question
*  or have any discussions around it.
*  Exactly. Where it's just like, no, I want to know
*  and I want to be better, but I need
*  help understanding. Even the language you use,
*  I want to be better. Yeah, yeah, I want to be better.
*  Be better. Be better, Michelle.
*  Be best.
*  But yeah, I mean, I don't... Yeah, I want
*  people to live whatever way they want to live. Yeah.
*  But help me a little bit
*  here. Like, I don't know.
*  And I don't even know how to look it up online.
*  You can't. You're not allowed to.
*  If they find out what you're searching, they'll come for you.
*  They'll come for you and take away
*  your Woke Pass. Yeah, now you can't
*  have another special because
*  you Googled
*  are you allowed to be a lesbian?
*  Well, people literally have gotten
*  massive blowback on their careers
*  because of that. Yeah. You know, because
*  of questioning whether or not trans people
*  can fight. I mean, Ronda Rousey
*  got a ton of shit, which she was saying she didn't think trans
*  women should be able to fight regular women
*  in MMA. I mean, biological
*  women, whatever you want to call it. If you didn't even say regular
*  women, like a piece of shit. Of course.
*  She is a regular woman.
*  Everybody's so angry.
*  And it's such a mob thing, too. It's funny
*  because these are the people that don't want bullies.
*  It's like the same people,
*  progressive people, are the ones who are like
*  anti-bullying. Oh, they bully just as much.
*  They bully more. They bully each other.
*  You can't be woke enough. You can't.
*  Because they're just feeding off of each other.
*  Like, I used to have piranhas, okay?
*  And one of the things that happens with piranhas is when
*  one of them gets sick, the other one's fucked them up.
*  They cannibalize each other
*  all the time. It was weird. What an animal.
*  Oh, they're so crazy. Like, one of them,
*  you see one of them have like a little slight little
*  wiggle to them and they'd be like,
*  look at Mike. And they just eat them? Yeah, they eat them.
*  Fuck them up. I'd come home and half a
*  piranha would be at the bottom of the tank. I'd be like, oh, you
*  fucking creeps. Jesus. So I'd have to scoop
*  it out. I had a hamster that ate the other hamster
*  once. Oh, I had that happen when I was a little
*  kid. Yeah. They had like
*  a wet tail. It was like a
*  disease. I don't know, but it's a weird thing
*  to walk home to when you're five. Yeah.
*  Her name was Fluffy and she was eating
*  her babies. She was eating her babies.
*  We came home, she was like a bloody
*  fucking baby. She's holding onto the baby's head
*  and just chewing up.
*  Like, what in the fuck
*  kind of pet is this?
*  And there was no warning. That was for me for hamsters.
*  There was no Google back then. So I was like, what is happening
*  here? I guess I have to go to the library and look this
*  up in the encyclopedia to see if it's
*  a thing. Why is my hamster eating
*  its baby's head like it's a fucking ripe tomato?
*  Ugh, it's so disgusting.
*  It was so disgusting. It was
*  burned into my head. I was like seven years old. I was like,
*  holy shit. Yeah. But
*  how did we get to that?
*  Oh, we were talking about woke people and
*  piranhas. Piranhas, yeah.
*  Like, that's what they're like. Like, when
*  one steps out of line, even when
*  woke people, they don't say,
*  hey, you know,
*  Sheila's a good person.
*  She just misspoke.
*  And Sheila's like, I'm sorry, I didn't really mean it
*  that way. I came out wrong. And everybody's like, that's cool.
*  This is what's important, kindness.
*  That's what's important. No, it's like, fuck Sheila
*  and fuck white people and fuck the patriarchy
*  and fuck the, and like, whoa!
*  It goes from, we
*  support you to burn it to the ground.
*  Burn it to the ground. Burn it. She can
*  have nothing anymore. And everyone's trying
*  to stand out as being like
*  ultra progressive and
*  hardcore with it. So everyone's
*  like making these hard stances on Twitter
*  where it's like, this is so aggressive.
*  I think, though, that my theory behind it is that
*  we've always liked, as a
*  human, we've always liked
*  to watch people die.
*  Whether it's figuratively or literally.
*  Because like, we used to do gladiator,
*  like when people got beheaded or
*  like burned at the stake. That was like a thing.
*  Like, everyone came to that from the town.
*  And they were all just like,
*  yeah, cause in that moment,
*  your life isn't as bad
*  as the person who's getting burned.
*  And I think that's what people are,
*  people just want to feel powerful.
*  They're online and they're like,
*  oh, I can take down this person.
*  And it's like, did you really
*  do anything today? Did you really just
*  destroy someone's life who was trying
*  to be a good person?
*  You know, and like, I mean, I don't know,
*  go after companies using plastic or something like that.
*  Yeah, you know, you're right.
*  There is a thing to that, right? When anyone
*  steps out of line publicly
*  and then people start attacking them, this is not
*  like a personal issue to them.
*  It's not like this person that did
*  this thing, it's like really affects your life.
*  But the amount of energy that people put
*  into it and the amount of time, like when people
*  want to go dig up those old tweets and want
*  to find out things that you said or
*  you know, and this, it is similar
*  to that feeling of watching a public execution.
*  Right.
*  And everyone's so
*  excited for it to happen.
*  Like they're just, they pile on, they'll go on
*  your Instagram, leave tons and tons
*  of like terrible comments.
*  You're getting canceled.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like, okay, good. Did you really feel
*  does that make your day better?
*  What are you making a face for, Jamie? What's going on?
*  I just found something dark as you guys
*  are talking about this. About hamsters eating their
*  kids. The last public hanging, there was
*  like a huge media event, like 20,000
*  people traveled to Kentucky to watch it happen.
*  There's a...
*  To see a white woman hang a black man.
*  She was the local sheriff and she didn't go through with it
*  because of probably the attention, so some
*  eager volunteers did it.
*  And while this was all going on, there was like
*  a media circus, people were eating hot dogs,
*  drinking lemonade, camping out overnight.
*  Oh my god.
*  It was a huge event. And it was
*  1936. Oh boy.
*  What did they say he did?
*  It said up there, scroll up, it said he was
*  wanted for the rape of a
*  70-year-old woman. That was the woman. Go scroll up.
*  Scroll up. Little higher. Little higher.
*  Little higher.
*  Yeah, see, Bethesda
*  confessed to the rape and murder of a
*  70-year-old
*  Lishy Edwards,
*  a capital crime under Kentucky
*  law, and one that fell upon
*  the local sheriff to punish. I could
*  appoint the deputy sheriff to deputize
*  any citizen to spring the trap.
*  Thompson told reporters that she stoically
*  resigned herself to the role.
*  But to do that would
*  inflict an unpleasant job
*  upon someone else. So she
*  decided this disgusting job,
*  she was going to do it, and then decided not to.
*  Oh, the first female executioner.
*  And then she couldn't do it. Not a good
*  look. Poor women.
*  The problem with those, anything post
*  slavery,
*  post 1865, there
*  were so many crimes that people
*  were arrested for that were nothing
*  where men were being forced to do labor.
*  So what would happen was
*  because of the fact that slavery
*  was now abolished, these men
*  would be loitering, right?
*  People didn't know what the fuck to do. Imagine you're a slave
*  your whole life. You grew up a slave.
*  Then all of a sudden you're free. You're like, what the fuck?
*  What do I do? Well, they would just arrest
*  you and then make you do hard labor
*  in jail for nothing.
*  Yeah, they essentially figured out
*  how to make slavery legal again.
*  And they did it for decades.
*  I mean, they still sort of do it today.
*  Sure. Yeah, I mean, when you make a
*  guy work in jail for a dollar
*  a day, whatever the fuck they pay, how is that
*  not slavery? Yeah. We're giving them gruel.
*  What are you giving them? White bread and fucking
*  shitty meatloaf? What are you feeding them?
*  It's one of those things where I'm like, we
*  get so mad at
*  a lot of the current stuff that's happening with
*  black people. And it's like, who, what we're supposed to be
*  saying, you know, like the right pronouns
*  to use all that stuff. And it's like,
*  yeah, okay, I'll try to say the right
*  pronouns. That's a pretty easy fix.
*  How about we go back and like
*  kind of correct some of this 400
*  years of slavery and oppression
*  that we did for black people?
*  Oh, is it because it's harder to do?
*  Like, it's not a solvable
*  problem. They them is easy. Yeah.
*  Captain Pink Hair.
*  I think the real problem is
*  these communities, like they've never
*  recovered, like places like Baltimore,
*  there's certain communities
*  that have been the same forever.
*  And South Side of Chicago is another one.
*  Right? There's these communities that
*  they're just, they're fucked with,
*  riddled with crime and drugs
*  and so many people in and out of jail
*  and this constant recidivism rate.
*  You grow up there,
*  you're in that system, like they would
*  have to... You may be in a terrible public school.
*  Like, you have to work
*  gangs as early as you can.
*  Drugs. I mean, the people that are heroes
*  in your neighborhood are drug dealers. So what do you,
*  how do you fix that? Boy, there's no effort
*  put to that in terms of like
*  like a systematic
*  national effort
*  on the federal level to step in
*  and do something to these
*  communities and do it on a scale that we
*  do in other countries when we bomb the fuck out of them.
*  Right. And also just
*  admit that we're racist.
*  Like, when an apartheid,
*  after apartheid happened, they had like a
*  day, there was a couple days of reckoning or whatever
*  it was called, where everyone
*  went up and they were like, these are the things
*  I did. Really? Yeah.
*  These are the things I did.
*  These are like the laws I broke
*  and it was like this like terrible
*  like cathartic
*  admit to your racism
*  and then let's try to heal
*  after that. And then we're all just like,
*  no, we're not racist. And I'm like, we're pretty
*  racist. Well, some people are
*  racist, but what's racist is
*  that these communities
*  suffered under a system
*  that was completely imposed
*  because of racism. Right. In the
*  1800s and then in the early
*  1900s and during the civil rights
*  era, this is all, I mean,
*  there's no denying that
*  it's the echoes of at least
*  ancient racism that needs
*  to be somehow or another addressed.
*  But I mean, how do you address that? Like,
*  some people want reparations and
*  like the idea of it makes sense,
*  right? Clearly someone
*  profited, right? There are to
*  this day, there's corporations
*  you can trace their money back to
*  slavery. Right. Right.
*  Well, it seems like
*  they should pay some. Yeah, they should pay a little bit.
*  How did you guys get rich? Like, if you
*  look at a giant plantation and they used to have
*  slaves and they profited off those slaves
*  and that plantation is somehow or another still in operation
*  today. Right. I don't know if that's the case.
*  But if it was like,
*  where'd you get your money? Yeah. What'd you do?
*  And then how do you go back giving it back?
*  How do you give it back? Who do you give it back to? Yeah.
*  Do you give it back to the ancestors of the
*  people who were slaves? And
*  the problem is like, if you give people money, I don't
*  think it fixes the problem. I think to
*  fix the problem, there has to be
*  some sort of, I mean, we've beaten this horse
*  to death on the show, unfortunately.
*  And I don't have any solutions. No
*  one ever has one. I don't know what
*  it would be, but I think there has to be
*  some way to clean up
*  communities. And I don't know how you would do that.
*  I mean, I have no idea. How do you
*  go to a place like, South Side of Chicago
*  has more murders than Afghanistan.
*  I mean, it's bad
*  there. It's fucking bad.
*  Am I making that up? I'm not making that up. No. I don't
*  think so. I think you're right. But that's
*  the thing. It's like, this is such like an unsolvable
*  problem and the
*  stuff that people go after on Twitter, like the
*  social justice stuff, is so
*  easy to do. And it's like,
*  yeah, of course that's what you're going to like.
*  You can have a hard day
*  or whatever shitty job you have.
*  And then you come home, you see someone
*  got mad at something or did something wrong
*  and you get to be like, yeah, this person,
*  you're cancelled.
*  And then you close your computer or whatever
*  or you watch people retweet it.
*  And you're like,
*  I did do something today.
*  I'm an activist. Yeah, I'm an online
*  activist. Yes, activist. And I
*  have power. I'm an educator. I contributed.
*  Yes, contributing. Yeah.
*  It's a weird tool.
*  I mean, it's a great tool sometimes.
*  Twitter is great for just getting out
*  information, letting people know
*  about something. You find something.
*  What I use it mostly, I find cool stories.
*  Like if I read some
*  cool article, like I was reading some article
*  about China has
*  made pig-monkey
*  hybrids.
*  China. Yeah.
*  And they've successfully made these pig-monkey
*  hybrids. And you know.
*  What do they look like? They didn't show.
*  They showed a picture of a pig fetus. I'm pretty sure
*  it was just a regular pig fetus. But they
*  didn't stay alive very long. The idea is
*  they want to get to a point.
*  Was it pig-human or pig-monkey?
*  I think it was pig-monkey.
*  You tweeted it was pig-monkey,
*  but they do it pig-human.
*  Alex Jones says they're doing pig-humans.
*  I bet he's right. I guarantee
*  he's right. They do pig-monkey
*  and then just like a little baby boy is born.
*  You're like, you little pig.
*  We are? Are we pig-monkeys?
*  But I think what they're trying to do is
*  develop pigs.
*  Their hearts and a lot of their
*  organs are very similar to ours.
*  And their digestive tract is very
*  similar to ours. There's certain tests they do
*  on how things are digested
*  and they do them through pig stomachs.
*  Well they do a lot of transplants with pigs now too.
*  Yes. So I
*  think that's the idea is
*  eventually get to a point where you can get
*  harvestable organs from pigs.
*  So they'd have some sort of a pig-human
*  hybrid. But you know someone's
*  going to fuck one. Someone's going to bring it home
*  and you got some pig lady walking around
*  your house, wha wha, Miss Piggy
*  cooking bacon for you. It's got like a
*  human vagina. Yeah.
*  So is it? You know?
*  A good one too. Real tight like a drum.
*  Tight like a drum. Tight like a drum. Always wet.
*  Wait, where does that saying come from?
*  Like a drum. Like a drum's pulled tight.
*  Oh, pulled tight. Okay, sorry. Sometimes
*  I'm the dumbest person in the world.
*  But it's true. It's the wrong kind of tight.
*  I'm like, I'm looking, I was like,
*  but drums have like a pretty big hole in the back.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ridiculous.
*  You know, you're 100% right.
*  Tight like a drum is a dumb way to describe a vagina
*  for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think it,
*  but I guess it is. Unless there's like a weird
*  covering over a vagina.
*  Tight like a fist. Like a
*  like a mason's fist. Like a
*  like a stone mason.
*  Someone who carries bricks every day and has fat
*  strong hands.
*  Tight like a, like a fucking
*  tight like a butthole.
*  Like a strong butthole.
*  Someone who squats a lot.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But if you can get a pig with a human vagina, well, that's
*  like people fuck sheep, right? Isn't that the whole
*  deal with sheep? Yeah, in New Zealand, I think.
*  Is it supposed to be like real close? That's what they say.
*  Probably in Pennsylvania, too. I mean, I'm sure
*  in Pennsylvania.
*  It's not gonna get carried away.
*  When people get, you know, again, what you
*  said, no options.
*  No standards. Yeah.
*  Yeah, if you found out
*  that no one was looking. I mean, they don't fuck sheep
*  because it's gross.
*  They fuck sheep because the sheep's that high.
*  And they're right there. Yeah. And they look
*  around and... What about that poor
*  guy who's the exact right hype
*  for a sheep? Yeah, perfect.
*  And he's just like, oh, I don't even
*  have to bend my knees at all.
*  What if the sheep's backing up in you, too?
*  The sheep likes it.
*  Who's the victim? Yeah.
*  Maybe the sheep was like... Maybe the sheep keeps like...
*  Yeah, the sheep likes it.
*  Keeps nuzzling up against him.
*  Like a Lizzo dance. Yeah.
*  I would love if that's that guy's
*  defense in court. He's just like,
*  no, but you gotta look at this video. You can't
*  tell me the sheep's not into this.
*  Here's a video of me entering into the pen.
*  Now look, they're all back towards me.
*  Backwards. Yeah.
*  They all just go right to the dick. One of them is buying,
*  I'm pretty sure, juice.
*  It's a ridiculous
*  thing that people fuck animals.
*  But animals fuck people, too. Yeah.
*  You ever see dolphins? Dolphins get a hold of people?
*  I've seen a video of that. It's crazy.
*  There's one where a dolphin came up on a woman.
*  Trying to fuck her.
*  There was an article, it's the best
*  trolling that has ever been done to me.
*  There was an article that said I was
*  guilty of bestiality. Oh.
*  It said, wolf guilty of bestiality.
*  And it was from my hometown newspaper.
*  The Homestown Sun.
*  Which is a very small newspaper.
*  There's like three or four people that work there, I think.
*  But like, it said that I was guilty
*  of bestiality. And they did so much
*  research. Like, they got
*  the paper,
*  the right paper, they got
*  all this information about me.
*  And then the surprising thing was at the end of
*  the article, it said I pled guilty.
*  And the fine was $1500.
*  And I was like,
*  it was about fucking dogs. That I was fucking dogs.
*  And I was like, well,
*  if that was what I was into,
*  $1500, like,
*  it's kind of worth it.
*  Depends how much money you have
*  and how big the dog's dick is.
*  Yeah. And I was also like, how is the dog,
*  is the dog
*  fucking me? Is it like a
*  peanut butter situation?
*  There's videos
*  like that that existed before the internet.
*  There was a video, like, I think it was called Barnyard
*  Betty. As me and my friend
*  Billy and my friend Ron, we went over their house
*  and it was in the basement. I remember
*  one of us had to guard the door in case
*  someone came into the basement. It was an old VHS
*  tape. So they put, they put the VHS
*  tape on and one of us had to stand by the
*  doorway to the basement. Like, just
*  to make sure that nobody opened the door and busted
*  us. And we watched this fucked up
*  video of these trailer
*  trash looking meth girls that were
*  blowing donkeys and having
*  sex with dogs. One of them had sex
*  with a German shepherd. It was so gross.
*  There was an episode
*  of Nip Tuck where that
*  happened. I remember that show. There was a
*  woman, she put like peanut butter on her vagina
*  and their dog would like lick it off.
*  Oh, that's real. That happens all the time.
*  Yeah. And I was like, I was like, this is, I remember
*  I was kind of younger and I was like,
*  that's a weird
*  thing to put in TV.
*  Wiffle dog bites. Yeah. Lick, lick,
*  lick, chomp. Yeah. So it's getting
*  greedy. It seems, it seems like a
*  dangerous situation. Yeah. If you had too many
*  dogs, like you said, like, oh, one's not enough.
*  I want one to lick my butthole too. Oh,
*  God. So you get a little peanut butter down there,
*  peanut butter on the vajayjay.
*  This is so gross.
*  Blah, blah, blah.
*  Whatever happened to that Nip Tuck show?
*  I don't know. I think it, I think it went off
*  the rails a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. It was one of those
*  shows. It started out real good. And then after a while
*  you're like, wait, what? What the fuck's happening here?
*  Yeah. Too many, like, yeah.
*  Dexter went way off the rails. Like,
*  it started out like, wow, this is kind of a cool show.
*  Cool idea. A guy who's like
*  a good guy, serial killer, huh? Yeah.
*  And then like four seasons in, you're like, hey,
*  what do you do? Who wrote this
*  one? Then I went with,
*  I loved the show Scandal.
*  And I saw that. And it was, I mean,
*  it's just a, I mean, it's,
*  it's not actually a great show, but I
*  really did like it. And the first
*  couple seasons, I'm like, this is great, this is great. Season
*  three and four, I was like, this is crazy.
*  And then like the end of it,
*  I was like, okay, they brought it back around. But
*  Well, the term jump
*  the shark came from Fonzie.
*  Right. Jumping over a tank full
*  of sharks. Yeah.
*  Literally like, people were like, get the
*  fuck out of here. What is
*  this? What are you doing?
*  Have you ever met Henry Winkler? I did
*  actually. He might be the nicest guy alive.
*  He's so nice. I saw him at the Emmys
*  last year and he introduced
*  himself to me, which I was like, this is the craziest
*  thing. I can't believe you know who I am.
*  Ha, that's weird, right? Yeah.
*  Someone famous knows you.
*  And I was like, this is like,
*  I mean, it's Henry Winkler. Henry fucking
*  Winkler. Could not be further
*  from the Fonz character. Yeah.
*  Like super sweet, really nice guy.
*  He wrote a book called I've Never Met
*  an Idiot on the River.
*  It's about fly fishing. Yeah. He loves
*  fly fishing, apparently.
*  And he just wrote a book about like
*  fly fishing. There's a lot of people who really like
*  fly fishing. It's fun. Yeah.
*  Yeah, but it's weird. There he is.
*  The Fonz. Oh, he
*  jet skied over the shark? Yeah.
*  Why do I think he was a motorcycle? I thought he did. This is what, he's popping up
*  he's skiing in a lake or something. Look at that.
*  Oh!
*  Of course he has his jacket on. Oh!
*  The Fonz. Got a leather
*  jacket on him. Yeah, I think it's more unbelievable
*  that he'd wear a leather jacket
*  water skiing than jump over a bunch
*  of sharks. Well, how about he's got it
*  in between his legs? Look at
*  how he's doing that. Go back to that original picture.
*  Where he's holding it. No, go back to
*  the original picture. Wait, did Henry Winkler actually learn how to
*  That one you just had? Three or two.
*  Yeah, but that's black and white. That's too artsy.
*  Right there. Look at, he's got it in between his
*  legs. That's the pole. Wait,
*  that looks like he's really doing that too. I bet
*  he is. Wow. Good start work,
*  Henry. Hey!
*  I mean, they didn't have CGI back
*  then. He kind of had to do it. Right, yeah.
*  Up until the point where it actually like
*  flew through the air and then they got some
*  rugged Brad Pitt from
*  Once Upon a Time in Hollywood type dude.
*  Look at that. Is that the shark?
*  That moment has now jumped the
*  shark as memes and stuff. Yeah.
*  So many jokes about it. But it's crazy that it was
*  such a bad episode
*  that it became symbolic
*  of a show going off the rails.
*  Showed Jump the Shark.
*  I like a good two season
*  show.
*  Like I love, I love a mini series.
*  I love Things that End. Do you watch Maisel?
*  No. I watched a little bit of it.
*  Okay, here's my problem with it.
*  I don't think the jokes
*  are funny.
*  Well, it's contextual.
*  Yeah, and I get that. But it's
*  like, I don't know. I just have a hard time
*  bel-
*  Listen, I've been watching a lot of
*  Lenny Bruce over the last few months.
*  I found this one Lenny Bruce channel on
*  YouTube. It's got all of his old,
*  old clips from various
*  television performances.
*  They don't make me laugh.
*  You know, I know he's the best.
*  I mean, I don't want to say he's the best,
*  but he's the godfather of this
*  thing that we do. That you and I both do.
*  He's the guy that started it. He really is the guy
*  who started talking about shit
*  instead of just telling jokes. He started like
*  talking about social problems
*  and why is this? And relationships
*  and sadness and
*  all kinds of weird stuff. I mean, he
*  developed a whole different kind of style
*  of stand-up comedy. But it's not
*  funny because you're
*  looking at something that happened in 1950,
*  in 1960. It's just, it's
*  so hard for it to translate.
*  Comedy, unlike anything
*  else, loses
*  its va- or its power
*  over time. Because if you listen to
*  like some- even like Red Fox
*  or something like really great
*  old stand-ups is not that good.
*  I don't know though. I do think there are
*  some jokes that stand up.
*  Sure, sure. I think there's some people that do
*  it that like even, you know,
*  50 years from now
*  people will look back and be like, that joke's still
*  funny. Oh yeah. Well, he had some of
*  those. Lenny Bruce had one joke
*  that many comics have accidentally
*  told since then. Cause they didn't
*  know any better. But
*  it was about gay people. The being
*  gays against the law. He's like, gee, it's
*  against the law, dig. So they put
*  you in jail with a bunch of guys who want
*  to have sex with you. Right.
*  It was great.
*  Back then it murdered. I mean, back
*  then it was just a fucking nuclear bomb. They're like,
*  oh shit, that's so true. I can't imagine being in the audience
*  and hearing someone talk like that
*  for the first time. Oh yeah.
*  Like, cause like the best comedy
*  I think is things you
*  you didn't- like
*  as soon as someone says it, you're like,
*  I have always thought that.
*  Yes. You know, they're just like vocalizing
*  something you were never able to kind of put together.
*  And that had to be that.
*  Yeah. In that audience. Then being like,
*  yeah.
*  Well, people were so
*  suppressed then. I mean, that's the other thing
*  about Lenny Bruce. He went to jail
*  multiple times. I mean,
*  he was arrested multiple times for telling
*  jokes. Yeah. Just
*  like, just kept doing it. Didn't
*  give up. Didn't say, well,
*  this is obviously not smart. Right.
*  He kept doing it. He kept pushing the envelope.
*  George Carlin, same thing. He went to jail
*  for it too. That's real standups
*  though. You know, like, you know, real standups
*  are ones that are just like, no, I have
*  to do this. Yeah. Like, you don't
*  do it for like a week and you're just like
*  crawling out of your skin.
*  Also, the audience
*  is ultimately supposed to be the judge
*  of whether or not something's good.
*  And if that's not the case, then we're losing personal
*  freedom. We're not asking someone
*  to like, you know, like
*  someone's not going on stage and saying, you know,
*  I'm going to advocate that you
*  murder someone. Here's their address.
*  We're all going to do it together. Let's meet up.
*  We're not talking about that. Right. We're talking about
*  someone cracking a joke and the audience
*  laughs and they enjoy it.
*  And today, even today, when people
*  get upset about someone stand upset and they try
*  to cancel something and
*  listen to the audience. Right. Was
*  the audience laughing? Well, they know it's
*  a joke, right? They're at a comedy show, so
*  they know it's a joke and they were laughing.
*  Why do you have a problem with it?
*  You're not even there. So you have a problem.
*  You're just looking for problems. Look at women
*  in Saudi Arabia. You want to look at real
*  problems? Look at real problems. Why don't you speak
*  out against that, you fucking cowards? Yeah, again,
*  it's hard. Yeah. It's easy. Like,
*  I hate any time, like,
*  I'm in favor of a comic telling whatever joke
*  they want. And then, like, the only
*  way you're going to know it's funny is if you say it
*  out loud to an audience. Yes. And
*  it might not be funny the first thousand
*  times you say it. Right. Until you
*  figure it out. Well, that was my
*  giant issue with comics
*  that were going after Louie after
*  that set was leaked. The only thing people should
*  have been mad about that is that the set was leaked.
*  That should be, that should have been like,
*  you don't know where he's going to end up with
*  that. No. He's known for doing
*  huge premises that you
*  disagree with and then he convinces
*  you why he's right. Yes. In a very
*  funny way. And tongue in
*  cheek. Yeah. I mean, it's not like he really
*  thinks that someone pushed a
*  fat kid in front of a bullet and that's why they're
*  talking in front of CNN. He's, he'll
*  figure out a way to make that work. This is his first
*  time doing stand up in ten months. Yeah.
*  Like, let, let's see where the joke
*  goes. But you know that. And
*  I know that. Because that's what we do. But
*  there's a lot of people that don't even understand the mechanics
*  of creating a joke that. Right.
*  Like, a lot of times you'll go up and you'll have a premise
*  and you're like, God, I fucking know there's
*  something. And he might eat shit with that joke
*  for a couple months before it really starts
*  really starts catching. Years
*  maybe even. You know, like there's, I,
*  there's always jokes I've had that like
*  now I'm coming back to, cause I was like
*  I wasn't ready to tell it then. And now I'm
*  getting back to it and I'm like, okay, maybe
*  this direction. Yes. Yes. But like it's
*  especially the harder the premise
*  that like it's gonna take a while. People have no
*  idea how hard it is to write jokes. Well that's
*  Ari's entire new hour
*  that he's doing. You know, his whole new hour
*  is, is called Jew. And it's
*  all, you know, he grew up orthodox
*  Jewish. Like, and you know, he had to
*  go to Israel and take
*  religious classes all day studying
*  the Talmud fucking 10, 12 hours a day.
*  Like he was doing the whole deal.
*  And his whole hour
*  now is about this. And we had talked about
*  him doing bits about that years
*  and years ago. But he's like, I wasn't ready.
*  Cause I, my standup
*  wasn't good enough yet. I didn't understand how to craft
*  a joke yet. Yeah. And I mean, it takes
*  a while to get there. And especially stuff that's
*  personal like that to you. And like, you
*  want to do it justice. You only get to tell that
*  story once on stage. And then
*  once you do those jokes,
*  hopefully they were good enough cause you're really not
*  going to get to revisit them. Yeah. For you to go
*  back over your, like, hey, I put an album
*  out 10 years ago and it kind of sucked. So I'm going to
*  redo all those bits. Please don't
*  go back and listen to The Roots until
*  after you see the second version.
*  Yeah. No.
*  There's some premises I would like to go back, redo.
*  Like, oh, god, that one.
*  I could have done so much more with that.
*  I feel like sometimes though, I feel
*  like sometimes you can, like, you know, you can
*  show kind of your evolution by redoing
*  some stuff a little bit.
*  But you can't, I don't know.
*  Yeah, you can show your evolution. You can do
*  whatever you want. Jerry Seinfeld still does
*  old jokes. Yeah. I mean,
*  they're perfectly good jokes.
*  Why would I throw them away?
*  He's done that a couple times for specials.
*  Right? Yeah. Didn't he do the Netflix special?
*  And an HBO special?
*  I'm telling you for the last time, I think
*  that was HBO.
*  Right? That was all his old stuff.
*  And then I think he did a Netflix special that was
*  very similar. It was like he went through his
*  old notes. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I think now
*  I think they made a multiple special
*  deal with him or something like that. Now he's putting
*  together his new one. Yeah.
*  I'm dying to see Eddie Murphy.
*  Yeah. I want to see him
*  work out. I want to see it work out. There was a rumor
*  that he was going to be at the store and we were all freaking out.
*  We were ready to go down. It was a Sunday night. Turned out to be
*  Damon Wayans. But there was a rumor that a
*  legend. Still funny. Still fucking awesome.
*  Damon is another one. He to me
*  is like one of the most unheralded
*  of the great comics from the 90s.
*  Yeah. But he was actually
*  really funny too. I saw him recently at
*  the lab in the improv.
*  So he hasn't done stand up or anything in a long time.
*  And so he's starting to go and do
*  it again. And then there was this rumor
*  that someone, some
*  star who
*  hasn't done stand up in a long time is going to do
*  stand up at the store in the belly room.
*  And everybody's texting everybody. Is fucking Eddie Murphy
*  going to the god damn comedy store? Is that really
*  happening? Right. We were all going to go down there
*  and watch. But it turned out to be Damon.
*  I'd love to see Eddie
*  working it out. Yeah. I want to see
*  him first time on stage. I want to see
*  middle. I want to see like. The middle?
*  Yeah. I want to see like a couple
*  of times. I want to see the first words out of his mouth.
*  Two months in and then like six
*  months in. Do you think he's going to do it?
*  I hope so. I really want to,
*  I mean like, I
*  I don't know. I mean, I, I,
*  we know what his early stuff is.
*  Yeah. He had this whole life.
*  Yeah. And, I mean,
*  I think part of it is he sees Dave just
*  like destroying. And
*  I, I hope there's like a little
*  competitiveness in him where he's like, he's like,
*  I got it, I got to jump back in.
*  Yeah. He still looks great.
*  Yeah. He looks so healthy.
*  Like I don't know what he's doing but
*  god damn it. That black don't crack
*  shit is not a lie. I mean, he
*  looks amazing.
*  He's, he's got to be
*  close to 60. Yeah.
*  And he looks 30. Yeah.
*  He really does. How old is he?
*  58. 58. Okay.
*  Pull up a recent picture of Eddie Murphy.
*  Pull like, when you saw him with Jerry
*  in Comedians in Cars
*  Getting Coffee. He's driving around with Jerry.
*  He looks great. By the way, I said Jerry
*  because we're tight-lipped. Right. Yeah.
*  I don't even know him.
*  But you know what I'm talking about.
*  He looks like, like in Beverly Hills Cop
*  he's like, he's just thinner.
*  Yeah, he's just young. And I don't mean thinner
*  that he's fat now. I just mean he's like
*  bulked up. He's bulked up. Become a man. Yeah.
*  Yeah. He was essentially
*  still a child then. He's so healthy
*  looking. Yeah, he looks great. What the fuck he's doing?
*  Look at that.
*  That photo.
*  I mean, he might be 36. Yeah.
*  He does not look like he's almost 60.
*  I mean, that is crazy. Look at Tracy.
*  Look at those gold chains. Those are preposterous.
*  Zoom in on those gold chains again.
*  What in the fuck, Tracy?
*  That's all about Walmart money.
*  We were at the cellar and
*  Tracy, Tracy
*  brought jelly beans.
*  And he was like, he was like, yeah.
*  Talking about the
*  jelly beans, like we
*  don't have access to them with our money.
*  You know? Like you'd be like,
*  I can't do any impressions
*  so this is going to be the worst Tracy Morgan you've ever
*  heard of. He's like, I got jelly beans.
*  Who else you know could bring jelly beans?
*  And then he's like, eat them. Eat the jelly beans.
*  He makes like all of us eat jelly beans and then he goes,
*  not the green ones.
*  Now what are those emblems?
*  One of them is Jesus.
*  That's a TM on that. Okay, Tracy Morgan.
*  A big TM, a plate.
*  By the way,
*  yeah, what is that one in the back? Hard to tell.
*  Bro, that fucking thing
*  has got to be heavy.
*  That must hurt your neck.
*  That's like a bike chain.
*  Go down, scroll down there with Eddie Murphy
*  with that beautiful young lady.
*  Scroll down, scroll down. Scroll,
*  look at that. Is that his girlfriend?
*  I think it's his wife. Partner.
*  Partner, whatever. Oh. But he's
*  divorced, right? Isn't he? Yeah.
*  Look at that. I think she just had a baby recently.
*  Kapow! Still fertile.
*  85 years old.
*  Ooh, she looks hot.
*  She looks very actressy hot.
*  Slim waist, nice booty.
*  Congratulations, Eddie. But look at him.
*  He's fucking almost 60 years old. Looks amazing.
*  Look at him.
*  This is amazing. Yeah.
*  Whatever he's doing, health-wise.
*  Incredible. This is what I want
*  of all people in Hollywood who like
*  look like that. I'm like, just tell us.
*  What are you doing? Tell us what you're doing.
*  I know we probably can't afford it. Well, I
*  probably can't afford it, but like tell us what you're doing
*  so we at least have an idea
*  that there's some crazy shit behind it.
*  Look at that fucking picture. Look at that
*  picture right there. Like is your water from a different
*  place? What kind of
*  vitamins? This is him for
*  dolomite, right? I believe so, yeah.
*  He's doing press. Almost 60 years old.
*  He looks like he's
*  15 years younger than me, at least.
*  I'm looking side by side on the screen.
*  Not bad. Trust me,
*  Brett.
*  I'm pretty healthy, but I party a little too hard.
*  Like he's got like a
*  little wrinkle right here.
*  Like a little crease in his face.
*  He's a little character. Slightly.
*  Makes him look a little bit better.
*  Just something that, look at those,
*  he only has one earring, sign of the times.
*  Right? Oh yeah, look at that.
*  One diamond earring.
*  He's like, I'm not gay.
*  I'm not going to have two earrings.
*  That's a big fucking earring too, boy.
*  That is a, look at the size of that
*  earring. That's like a fucking quarter million
*  dollar earring. Good diamond.
*  It's a big diamond.
*  Big ass rock for your ear.
*  He's done well. He's done well.
*  I don't know if you've heard about it.
*  It's Jags!
*  And you know, he did a thing
*  a few years ago,
*  right when Cosby was starting to get into trouble,
*  when, I don't know if you saw it,
*  but he did like this thing where he was at a panel
*  and he was receiving some award
*  and he started doing a little stand up.
*  And talking about them taking away Bill Cosby's awards.
*  And Bill Cosby's,
*  his,
*  his, what is it, was it
*  his diploma? His Mark Twain award.
*  Yeah.
*  First live set in 28 years.
*  And I'm telling you, he was
*  so sharp. Did you see it?
*  No, I watched it back then. I can't really remember
*  what he said. It was really good. But I remember watching it back then.
*  And I remember being like,
*  this guy, two weeks on stage
*  he'd be fine. Yeah!
*  He's sharp. If he had material,
*  he's fucking sharp.
*  Sharp as a tack.
*  I mean, how great. Did you know his brother?
*  I didn't. I mean,
*  huge fan of his as well.
*  He was the nicest guy. I loved that guy.
*  That was a bomber.
*  That was a huge bomber. Charlie and I did a
*  tour together in like 2007.
*  We did like 22
*  cities. We traveled together for the whole month.
*  Like the whole month together.
*  He was so nice. He was so cool.
*  Just a fucking great
*  guy. Yeah.
*  I was a big fan of his too. And a guy that was basically
*  a famous
*  person first and then
*  started doing stand up, which is the hardest
*  way to do it. It's definitely the hardest
*  way. No one wants to believe you.
*  No! You're on stage
*  and people are like, you're famous.
*  Let's see your A plus
*  act that I paid money to see.
*  And you're basically an open mic'er.
*  Yeah. And people
*  are paying to see you. Yeah. So he started
*  out, he would host.
*  That is a very smart way to do it.
*  Smart dude. He would host
*  and then he would slowly
*  work up enough material that he could
*  do a set.
*  And he was an older guy too. Yeah.
*  When that happened, he was deep into his 40s
*  when things really started clicking for him.
*  That's awesome. Imagine being an open
*  mic'er and famous
*  and in your 40s. No.
*  Fuck. I mean.
*  At least then though you have life experiences
*  to pull from. Yeah.
*  You hear a lot of these people when they're like,
*  some people start in their teens and they turn out to be
*  the best in the world, Dave Chappelle.
*  But other people start in their teens
*  and I'm like, have some life first.
*  What are you telling jokes about? Right.
*  I mean, I had
*  a whole career
*  before I got into stand up. How old were you
*  when you started? I started
*  in 2011 so I was
*  26,
*  25, 26.
*  What was your, you were saying your career
*  you were talking about? So I was, I started
*  in finance. I used to work on Wall Street.
*  I got a job at Bear Stearns.
*  So that's the Wolf of Wall Street? Yeah.
*  That's where Joe comes from.
*  Still trying to make it happen.
*  But I
*  started Bear Stearns in the summer 2007
*  and then it collapsed
*  in March of 2008.
*  And then I stayed up with JP Morgan
*  for a couple years after that.
*  But I wore a suit every day.
*  I worked with like
*  mutual funds and separately managed
*  accounts.
*  When do you think,
*  when did you, when were you thinking about
*  stand up? Were you thinking about it in the beginning?
*  Well, so in March of 2008
*  a bunch of friends of mine, this is like
*  before Bear
*  collapsed, a bunch of friends of mine went to see
*  a taping of SNL. I've always been
*  such a huge fan that afterwards
*  I was like, how do these people do this?
*  Like, how do you get here?
*  And I Googled them and they all started an improv.
*  So I started doing improv and I did
*  that for a couple years. And then
*  and even at my first improv class I was like
*  whatever, I just want more of this.
*  And then I eventually got into stand up
*  after that around 2011.
*  But it was one of those things where
*  I was very much like, you know, like a very type A,
*  get good grades,
*  try to get the best grade in the class
*  type of person.
*  And I didn't really develop opinions
*  or a point of view.
*  And so when I started doing
*  improv, I was like,
*  you know, like you make choices
*  and you know, like, and then
*  more I got into stand up I was like
*  yeah, how do I feel about these things?
*  Like, what do I think about them?
*  And like really just like,
*  I don't know, it's just that's how I
*  it's really when I feel like I started becoming a person.
*  Wow.
*  I don't really think I had a personality before that.
*  I wonder if I
*  would have been as curious
*  if I wasn't a stand up.
*  How much of my curiosity is
*  because I started getting curious about things because
*  I wanted to be able to talk about different things.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I, I'm definitely much more
*  observational in the world
*  than I used to be.
*  But I'm also, I might be a little like
*  darker too.
*  Like, I remember thinking when I was a kid,
*  like I thought about what my wedding would look like
*  as like a little girl.
*  And now the idea of having a wedding
*  seems ridiculous.
*  Like the idea of me
*  in like a big dress walking down
*  an aisle, like there's none of that
*  I could take seriously.
*  But if you were going to get married, how would you do it?
*  I would just go to City Hall.
*  Really? Yeah. Wow.
*  And then have a party or something? Maybe.
*  Later. I don't, I don't know.
*  It seems weird, it seems weird to have a
*  party right after because you're like, let's see if this is
*  going to stay.
*  But if you're going to get to the point
*  where you're going to have a legal contract
*  with someone, especially you now,
*  because you don't want that Roseanne bar
*  Tom Onral type deal. You don't want to pay some dude off.
*  Yeah, no. Like imagine.
*  Yeah, I can't. Things start popping for you,
*  you got some guy who kind of like comes with you on the road,
*  becomes your tour manager.
*  No way. Yeah. Well, that's the thing, that would never
*  happen to me though because one of the things I find
*  most attractive is a guy
*  being really good at something.
*  Oh, and he's really good at being your tour manager.
*  Yeah, I mean, just the
*  best tour manager. The best.
*  Always has the best hotel rooms
*  waiting for you. Yeah, it's like
*  there's like every time I go in, it's set up
*  the exact way I want it.
*  Stuck with green jelly beans.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck you Tracy.
*  Yeah, I think, well, that's
*  the case with most women. Most women, I think,
*  like guys that are good at stuff.
*  Yeah. It's rare
*  that you see like a, yeah, I mean,
*  we want, I don't know, I believe.
*  Provider, someone who's, well, you want
*  successful genes. Yeah. And that's really
*  what it boils down to. Men want attractive
*  genes. Women want successful genes.
*  Or they want, well, they also want attractive
*  genes too. They want dominant
*  genes like a big man, big tall
*  man. Yeah. Good features. Good symmetry.
*  Yeah. Yeah, all those things are genetic.
*  It's normal. Yeah, I've been working on this new joke
*  about how women, we like, we're
*  attracted to the exact thing that's the most
*  dangerous to us. Like, we
*  like those men and so we make
*  more dangerous men.
*  Like, we could decide to just
*  only mate with like short, soft
*  boned men. And make
*  like a whole generation of like killable
*  killable dudes. Killable men.
*  And women would be like, yeah,
*  we're the ones in power, but we're not, it's never
*  going to happen. Yeah, but that would have to be a real conscious
*  decision that's against
*  evolutionary biology. It would have to be like
*  women have to be like, first of all, we'd have to get women to
*  agree on something, which isn't
*  going to happen. No.
*  But then also, like, yeah, you'd have to be like,
*  no, this is the law.
*  Like a reverse handmaids thing
*  or something. Oh, reverse handmaids.
*  Yeah. Like, we're going to
*  outbreed all the
*  goliaths. Yeah. And all the gorillas.
*  All the savages and barbarians.
*  We're going to cut them off. Every
*  once in a while, like a baby's born, it's like
*  at the height, like height and
*  weight is too high and they're like, we've
*  got to get rid of this one. Flush them. Yeah.
*  Hold them down. Hold them in the tub.
*  Yeah. Oh,
*  that's not wise. Because China's not going to do
*  that. China's not going to do that. They're going to use CRISPR
*  and develop Hulk babies. We're going to need
*  the might. We're going
*  to need the muscle.
*  Dum dum dum.
*  Are you worried at all about something like that?
*  Are you worried about a war?
*  With China? Do you ever think about it?
*  Do you ever think like Russia, China? Like I've been hearing this
*  term, hot war.
*  You know, like we're involved in
*  a cold war with Russia. We're involved
*  in a cold war with Russia.
*  What do they define hot war? Bullets.
*  Oh. Yeah, I mean,
*  I don't know if I can imagine
*  us getting into
*  a war like that again, but I do
*  worry about like,
*  like hacking, like more of like
*  a, what's it called? Cyberwar.
*  Yeah, cyberwar. I think that's
*  much more likely.
*  It is much more likely, but god damn,
*  if there was some sort of like a real
*  attack from China
*  or from Russia, it would be more
*  China than Russia. I think
*  from what I understand, Russia does not
*  really have the money. They have,
*  you know, they have a military,
*  but they don't have the kind of military
*  that we have. It's a pretty big drop
*  off from the United States to what Russia
*  has, but they're scary enough and dangerous
*  enough that we have to keep an eye on them.
*  I feel like
*  ever since nuclear weapons came about,
*  people are like,
*  yeah, let's not do those kinds
*  of wars anymore. We still do them in Iraq.
*  We still did in Afghanistan.
*  We'll still go in if there's air quotes,
*  insurgents. Right.
*  Yeah. And, you know, we need the oil.
*  Yeah, a little bit.
*  Oh no, our oil is getting a little
*  low.
*  No, I think
*  about, I think often like,
*  what if there was a war
*  and they had to put the draft back in?
*  And then I think about all my guy
*  friends and I'd be like, well,
*  first of all, I don't want them to fight,
*  like, because I like them. But also,
*  can you imagine like Mark Normand
*  like as a soldier?
*  He's a pretty fit guy.
*  He's very fit, but
*  I can't imagine him like
*  killing people, you know?
*  I can't imagine him on a battlefield.
*  He'd probably make snarky jokes.
*  I can imagine Ari
*  could kill people. I can imagine Ari
*  kill people. I can imagine Ari giving
*  the other soldiers some
*  sort of pill.
*  For sure.
*  He would definitely dose their water supply.
*  Guys, I know how to stop this.
*  Find the reservoir and dump a bucket of acid into it.
*  This is just going to make whatever happens today
*  a lot of fun.
*  Like, who out of your friends do you think
*  would be a good soldier?
*  Um...
*  Well, I think Dan Soder
*  would be a good soldier. He's a big fellow.
*  He's a big guy and he's also just like
*  a football player. He was a football
*  player. I mean, he's a teddy bear,
*  but he's also, I think, for the right
*  reasons, he'd be like, I would kill them.
*  But it would have to feel personal to him.
*  Personal. Yeah.
*  Like the commies.
*  I don't think, uh...
*  It's more fun to think about the people I don't
*  think could do it. Like,
*  there's no way Keith Robinson, even
*  before his stroke, was getting into
*  a war.
*  That's fucked up.
*  But after the stroke, maybe he's got less to lose.
*  No, he's even now.
*  Now he'd be like, he'd be like, I'm out!
*  I got a stroke! Look at me! I can't
*  fight anymore. I can't fight. Has he had any recovery
*  of his motor skills?
*  He, it's still pretty much like
*  not super usable.
*  But he gets up on stage
*  every night.
*  Jokes are probably funnier than ever.
*  His stroke material is like
*  really, really good. Really?
*  Yeah. Wow. That's awesome.
*  And he's one of my favorite
*  people to sit at the table with.
*  Because you sit down, you're immediately making
*  fun of each other. Right. You know, you're making
*  fun of everyone else. Like, it's just jokes
*  the whole night. It's so fun. People don't understand why
*  that's so fun for us. It's- To shit
*  on each other. It's great. It's
*  so much fun. It's one of my favorite things
*  to do. It's one of my favorite things too about comics
*  is shit on each other. It's fun. And
*  it also, it's good for you. It really is.
*  It's healthy to like get
*  shit on so you laugh. And like
*  know that you can laugh yourself. People who can't
*  laugh at someone shitting on them, they're the worst.
*  The worst. It's the worst. Yeah. It's just like,
*  we're just having fun. It's also like, it allows
*  us to say the stuff that like, cause
*  comics will say pretty much anything on stage, but
*  there is a line where we're like, no, this is for only
*  other comics. Yes.
*  So true. Like this is,
*  we gotta- Yes. There's oftentimes
*  we'll be in a discussion and we'll kinda look
*  around and be like,
*  if that guy heard any of that stuff
*  we were talking about having sex with midgets, I don't
*  think any of us are gonna have a career
*  anymore. Yeah, if someone put like a hidden
*  camera and a hidden microphone in the
*  back bar of the comedy store, oh
*  Jesus Christ. No. Yeah. I mean
*  really, really in trouble.
*  When you're trying to shock other comics,
*  you know, you're trying to shock
*  road hardened veterans.
*  Cause our problem is that like
*  we wanna say the funniest thing.
*  And normally that's way past
*  the line, even past our line
*  where you're just like, no,
*  this isn't. I have this Sober October group
*  text that I'm in with Ari Shafir,
*  Burt Kreischer and Tom Segura, and it's
*  fucking ridiculous. Yeah. Sometimes
*  it's so, sometimes it's so ruthless
*  and so ridiculous. I just go,
*  oh fuck. I'm in a few of those texts.
*  Yeah, me too. Group texts. Group texts
*  with other comics are the best. It's so
*  great. I also have a group text that's with
*  a couple of my female friends and
*  like that one, I'll look away
*  from my phone and then I'll look back
*  a minute or two later and there'd be like
*  96 texts
*  and I'm just like, what happened?
*  And there's three different conversations
*  going on. Simultaneously. Yeah.
*  I can't do that. I don't understand
*  that. It's really like
*  being, being friends
*  with women is a lot of work.
*  Do you prefer
*  being friends with men? I
*  love being friends with men.
*  I also love being friends with women because there's
*  stuff that they, you can talk to them
*  about that just like
*  either you can say it to men, but they're not going to have the
*  in-depth discussion about it that you want
*  to happen. You know, like women
*  will just indulge each other and be
*  like, but how did he say it?
*  You know?
*  Like, oh, he put a
*  period? Like, was there a period
*  after the text? And he's like, yeah, there was a period.
*  Well then, yeah, I don't think that's good. Yeah.
*  If he just left it open.
*  Maybe it's casual.
*  You know what? How many times have you had a conversation
*  when someone just writes something like
*  sure? Yes.
*  Like, what does that mean? I do it all the- What does sure mean?
*  I do it accidentally sometimes. I'll be like, yeah
*  sure. I won't say, yeah
*  I'll just say sure. Right. Do you want to go there?
*  Sure. Okay, she's mad. Yeah.
*  She's mad. Sure?
*  Sure sounds like a fight is about to happen.
*  Yeah. Sure.
*  Sure. You always decide.
*  You always-
*  Another, like more aggressive would be fine.
*  Fine. Yeah. Do you want to go there?
*  Fine. Oh, fine.
*  Yeah. Fuck's happening. I'm in trouble.
*  Fine's not good. I'm in a lot of trouble. Fine's not good.
*  You go to pick her up, she's not smiling.
*  Like, what are we doing? Should we do this?
*  Should we stay home? Fine.
*  If you want to fight, let's just do it now
*  and not wait until we get to the restaurant.
*  Yeah, well that's fine. What the fuck does that mean?
*  I also think it's good for men
*  when women have a lot of female
*  friends because
*  good for the other person you're dating or married
*  to. You should want your girlfriend to have
*  a couple female friends so that
*  she can have the conversations.
*  Oh yeah. With- Like the more I think about
*  relationships, the more I'm like
*  no, men and women-
*  Like a husband and wife shouldn't be having
*  all of those discussions.
*  Like he doesn't want to hear it.
*  He doesn't want to hear it.
*  Have it with your girlfriends.
*  And then just talk to him about whatever
*  else. Like- Yes.
*  I couldn't agree more.
*  It's an unrealistic expectation.
*  I go on double dates with my wife and her and her friend
*  and me and the- And it winds up being two different conversations.
*  I get stuck with the husband
*  and she's talking to her friend like, oh my god, so cute.
*  Oh my god, did he say that? Oh my god.
*  They just have these rambling
*  girl conversations.
*  Like, hey, let's have one conversation.
*  We can't do this two conversation thing.
*  Yeah, and it's like, it's so
*  nice to have the girls just
*  to be like, yeah, I get to
*  indulge the girl side
*  of myself.
*  That's a thing. That's a real thing.
*  It's a real thing. Yeah.
*  But some people want to pretend
*  that men and women are the same thing.
*  I think that's such a detriment
*  to both men and women.
*  Like, saying that women are the same as men, it's like,
*  well, we're not, but also
*  why do we want to be? Right.
*  Why is that happening? Why is that even
*  the standard? Right. Like, just let
*  women be what we are. Yes.
*  And men can be what they are, and then there's
*  some people that do float in the middle, but like-
*  Well, I think it all gets conflated
*  with equal rights.
*  Like, equality, equal rights,
*  equal laws, equal,
*  you know, willingness to try
*  different jobs, those kinds of things. Yeah.
*  And then we decide that men and women are not
*  any different, and that these are all
*  cultural creations,
*  and these are things
*  that are concocted by society.
*  Right. And I think, I mean,
*  I think it's kind of,
*  it's bad for women when we say,
*  well, we're just the same as men, because it's like,
*  you're saying with that
*  sentence that men are
*  correct.
*  And when you finally start to think of us
*  as men, as the same as men,
*  now we're correct, too.
*  Hmm.
*  What I like to say is that men and women aren't math.
*  Exactly. Like, we're not equal, we're different
*  things. Yeah. It's not,
*  it's not an equality thing. You make all the people.
*  Like, they will never be equal to you.
*  You make every fucking human
*  that's ever made is made in a woman's
*  body. Exactly. This, this whole
*  thing, though, is weird to me, because I'm like,
*  where did this come from? This didn't exist before.
*  The equal rights thing existed before.
*  Yeah. But this, that, that,
*  it's some sort of a cultural creation
*  that women are different
*  than men. That this is
*  something that society
*  has sort of imposed on women. Like,
*  no, women like different things.
*  Yeah. And like, we,
*  like, we just
*  sometimes just like to be around
*  each other, which men I think sometimes just like to
*  be around each other, too. For sure.
*  You know, like, it's like, I can hang out with the boys,
*  no problem. I grew up with older brothers,
*  you know, like, all I ever did was hang out
*  with boys. But now, like,
*  I also see so much
*  value in just getting to be with
*  girls. Yeah, you
*  should. I mean, it's, and men do with
*  men. There's a lot of stuff that men like
*  that women don't, a lot of women,
*  don't have interest in. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's okay. It's fine. But this
*  idea, like, that's toxic. Like,
*  toxic masculinity, like, all this
*  nonsense that we hear today. It's
*  all exactly what we were talking about before, where
*  people try to control people and define people.
*  Yeah. It's the same thing. It's like.
*  I think that's one of the reasons you see it a lot,
*  especially online from white women,
*  because we want to have
*  power. You know,
*  like, we want to be able to, and
*  I mean, us being able to tell
*  other people what they can and
*  cannot do or say
*  is us just being like, yep,
*  that's our power now. We might
*  never be better than white men,
*  you know, but we can at least control
*  what you get to say about us.
*  And I think
*  as soon as white women are like, yeah,
*  we do like to have control, then
*  we'll be like, thank you,
*  let's dismantle all of this.
*  It's the same kind
*  of toxic masculinity, you know, like,
*  it's just like, it's all toxic.
*  You know, like, how dare you tell
*  black people how to feel about,
*  you know, like, what jokes we can and cannot say about
*  black people. Did you ask any of them?
*  You know, like, you see
*  I'm sure you see at stand-up shows where
*  there's like white women with their arms
*  crossed, and then like
*  when you start talking about race, and then
*  black people who are laughing, and you're like,
*  they're like, you shouldn't be able to
*  tell jokes about black people like that. And it's like,
*  did you look? Well, I think a lot of it
*  too is people working in offices all day
*  where they're constantly suppressed. Right.
*  Like, the way you communicate in an office
*  is so vastly different than the way a comic
*  communicates on stage in front of a nightclub.
*  It's so different that most people,
*  the vast majority of their day
*  is under the spell of human resources.
*  Right. You know, they have
*  this imposed standard of communication
*  that's, it's not how they want
*  to talk. It's not how they want to behave and think.
*  Like, and also,
*  men and women working together is
*  strange. It's strange.
*  And anybody who says it's not strange never
*  work with women and men together. Right.
*  Because people get attracted to each other,
*  people get petty, people get jealous,
*  people get flirty, people get mean,
*  people get controlling. They play social
*  games with each other. Yeah, and I mean,
*  it's one of those things where it's like,
*  you can't even broach the subject now
*  because people are like, it's not an issue.
*  And I'm like, no, there are so
*  many issues. It's fraught with issues.
*  Yes. Like, let's talk about it.
*  Like, okay, yeah, there's a lot of sexual harassment
*  that happens in offices, but there's also a lot
*  of legitimate relationships that happen in
*  offices. Yeah. Like, there's flirting,
*  there's one night stands, there's,
*  you know, like, all of this is happening.
*  People get married and have kids. Yeah.
*  People fuck for a while,
*  and then they might hate each other,
*  but they still got to figure out how to work together.
*  That happens all the time. All the time.
*  The hilarious thing is when that happens,
*  and there's a boss and someone
*  who's below them. Yeah. They'll say, oh,
*  he abused his power.
*  And again, I look at it from my perspective
*  where I'm like, I'm attracted to
*  men who are good and powerful.
*  So, if I
*  were going to have, I worked in an office,
*  and my boss
*  was really good looking,
*  and I was attracted to him, and there was a
*  chemistry, and we started sleeping
*  together. Woo! Like,
*  that's what I wanted. And then,
*  you know, like, yeah,
*  this is like. You're going to get canceled just for saying that.
*  A hundred percent. You can't say that.
*  You can't say that you want to be with someone powerful,
*  and someone who's
*  who holds something over you. Yeah, I do see.
*  You should fuck the janitor. Be a good person.
*  Yeah, I mean, if he's really hot, you know, I might get every shot too.
*  I mean, you could hook him up.
*  You could get married now,
*  this is the whole thing. Yes, but take it
*  seriously. It's important for
*  his culture. Don't be
*  an asshole about it. I'm his
*  way in.
*  I do think, like, I do see it now, and this
*  is a weird thing, but like, super feminist
*  women, I do see a lot of them kind
*  of dating, like,
*  jawless, like,
*  kind of push over guys.
*  And I'm like,
*  oh, maybe they're
*  maybe they're the women I'm talking about.
*  They're like, no, I found these short
*  I found these soft-boned men.
*  You know, like, jawless is a fun
*  way to describe it. They're so jawless.
*  Jawless.
*  Jawless men. Fuck, that's such a
*  bummer.
*  But really bad genes like that, like, ooh,
*  there's not a goddamn thing they can do about that.
*  No, I don't think you can get a new jaw.
*  They give you a jaw surgery.
*  They can, like, try to grow your jaw
*  out with, like, they cut your jaw
*  and break it and, ugh.
*  Ugh.
*  I know a lady who got a chin
*  she had a chin like this.
*  And she didn't want to keep it?
*  No, she didn't want to keep it. So she got a
*  chin implant.
*  I think they might have done something to her actual
*  jaw itself, too.
*  But it was one of those very unfortunate
*  chins. You know?
*  And then she what? Couldn't eat for, like?
*  I don't know. They put a piece of plastic
*  or something where her chin
*  like, it used to go in too far.
*  And then it came out a little bit. Did she have
*  syphilis? I don't know. I didn't ask.
*  I didn't know her that well. She told me she had a chin
*  implant. I was like, what?
*  You had a what? You like your jaw?
*  She didn't like the shape of her jaw.
*  So she got her jaw reworked. Well, some of these guys
*  should get a look into that.
*  I don't think there's much you can do.
*  If you have a tiny little jaw.
*  Fuck. That's a bummer.
*  But yeah, working with men and women
*  working together is like, there's a way to figure it out.
*  But
*  it's fraught with complications.
*  It is. And the real issue is people
*  holding things over you in
*  order to get you to sleep with them. It's not
*  you being someone who works
*  or someone who's legitimately attracted to this guy
*  and then you get together. Still, if I was running
*  a company, I'd say, hey, don't fuck each other,
*  you assholes. I'm trying to make money.
*  Right. Yeah. I want productivity.
*  I don't want to spend. I don't want. Yeah, like, I don't want to spend.
*  And I can't
*  condone it legally. Right.
*  Right. Because if I say, yeah, what are you banging
*  your secretary? All right.
*  Fuck yeah. Take a picture.
*  Come on. You know, what am I going to say?
*  You would have to say
*  that it's in the rules and regulations.
*  You would have to say. But it's, there's
*  no way you can tell me that it's
*  not possible for a man
*  and a woman who work together. And the guy's the boss
*  and the woman works under him and they fall in love
*  and they have an amazing relationship. It happens all the time.
*  It does. Bill and Melinda Gates.
*  Oh, she worked at Microsoft.
*  Oh, that piece of shit. Bill
*  is a piece of shit. I mean, he's a
*  power hungry piece of shit who abused
*  his power. And you can see it when you look at it.
*  It's basically rape. It's basically
*  rape. He had power over her. Basically.
*  Yeah. He's actually been a prisoner.
*  Oh my God. I can't believe this.
*  We've got to give her half of that hundred
*  billion dollars that he has
*  and get her out of that ivory
*  tower. Of course this happens.
*  Of course it happens. Yeah. It's
*  what the real issue is. Someone's
*  sexually harassing you. Like some guy
*  was holding a promotion
*  over your head saying that he wants you to
*  sleep with him or making lewd comments
*  and make you feel disgusted. Right.
*  Or you show up to work and you're not interested in that person
*  at all. You just want to do your job.
*  And they're making comments about your breasts or your
*  legs or your mouth or
*  fuck. Oh, the mouth comments are the worst.
*  They're somehow creepier than like the
*  breast or the butt. It's just like your mouth.
*  Oh, stop it.
*  I'm in a sex room with this fly down
*  pants still on.
*  God.
*  Look at that little mouth.
*  Stop talking about my mouth.
*  The problem is there's no
*  equivalent with men. There's no
*  one thing that a woman can say to a man that makes
*  him feel like a piece of meat like that.
*  Like humiliated.
*  It's so hard to sexually harass
*  men because they're into so
*  much of it. Yeah, we'd like it.
*  Yeah, especially if we're attracted to you.
*  You sexually harass. Like if your boss
*  is like you want this job, you gotta
*  eat my pussy. Be like, how?
*  Let's fucking do this. Here or
*  later or?
*  How much am I getting?
*  How much of a raise are we talking
*  about here? Can I also get a couple of certification
*  days? How many days do I
*  get and how many can I get?
*  Does it depend on the performance?
*  Right, right, right. What if I really
*  know what I'm doing? Can we
*  do this a lot?
*  She's like, well, let me see.
*  I don't know. I'll give you a performance review.
*  I know you're married and I have
*  a wife as well, so let's just like
*  keep this on the slide. Let's just fuck the shit out of your work.
*  We're good. We're good. I'll make an extra
*  40, 50 grand a year.
*  By the way, we are going to need to get something to lock
*  that door.
*  You want the Matt Lauer buttons to click.
*  But the thing is like even if
*  so even if like a male boss, even if you got
*  everything like in writing beforehand
*  saying like this is consensual.
*  Yes. I think you could easily
*  say afterwards it wasn't.
*  I felt coerced into signing that.
*  That's exactly what's happening with Matt Lauer.
*  That's exactly what happened. Is it?
*  Yeah, that's exactly what happened. He was having
*  a sexual affair with a woman that he worked
*  with that wasn't even under him.
*  She was in a different department and they're
*  still saying that he had like power over her.
*  It might be correct though.
*  See, the thing is with this Ron Farrow
*  guy, Ronan Farrow guy,
*  you know, he's obviously a real legitimate
*  journalist. He's done a deep dive into
*  these things. So it's so hard to say.
*  Until Matt Lauer comes out and just like
*  has
*  he has to make
*  statements I guess on all these different
*  things because apparently there were some people that got
*  paid off. Right. And it's something
*  that like NBC denied.
*  And then he's proven there's been several
*  different compensation
*  payoffs for people that were sexually
*  harassed. Well, even when you hear
*  like about payments, you're like,
*  yeah, that might mean
*  it's legitimate or it might mean
*  that they thought this is the easiest way
*  to fix this problem. Unless
*  you're talking about Bill O'Reilly.
*  That is, yeah.
*  That's the gold standard
*  of sexual harassment. When you
*  pay that chick 32 million,
*  you're like, what did you say Bill?
*  What did you do? That's not just
*  keep quiet money.
*  That's just like, no, we don't, I don't want to have to deal
*  with it anymore. Just give her the 32
*  million. It's like
*  And we went over it. Apparently
*  there's also a clause that she has to
*  deny that anything
*  ever took place. And then if evidence
*  comes out, she has to lie
*  and say that evidence is not valid.
*  I mean, for
*  32 million. You gotta do what you gotta do.
*  You're in the clear for life.
*  You don't have to work again. That lady right now
*  has probably got her feet up.
*  She's probably got like fluffy
*  slippers on, sipping tea.
*  Living exactly where she wants to live.
*  Laughing.
*  It's every now and then
*  she just like wakes up in the morning
*  and then just realized she doesn't have to do
*  shit ever again.
*  Fuck you Bill.
*  I mean, she won. Oh my God, did she win?
*  She won 32 million
*  dollars. Yeah. If you live
*  a reasonable life, you don't have
*  to do a goddamn thing with 32 million.
*  You take vacations every year.
*  You buy a nice, fat new car
*  every year. You live in a beautiful
*  house. You have to do shit.
*  You have help. You have like, I mean,
*  you're set. Yes. Yes. 32 million.
*  What is that in just 10%?
*  That's 3 million dollars a year.
*  Just in interest.
*  Yeah. Right?
*  If you can make your money work for you.
*  You're a financial person. Is that real?
*  Can you do that? Get 10% interest?
*  I mean, it depends what you're
*  invested in. If you have legit 32 million
*  in the bank,
*  what would you get out of that?
*  Well, is it just in
*  what is it in? The savings account?
*  Funds and 401Ks
*  and what would it have to be in
*  order to get 3 million dollars a year?
*  I don't know. I don't know what it would have to be in.
*  But, uh...
*  Bonny Madoff type shit?
*  I know, I mean, I only ever like
*  sold mutual funds. Like that's what we
*  did like, due diligence on mutual funds
*  and stuff like that. And what's a good return?
*  It really depends.
*  There's a lot of funds that like, it fluctuates
*  but there's like a good 4%, you know?
*  4%? Yeah. That's not good enough.
*  She wants to live like a baller?
*  She needs more.
*  I'm sure there's higher yield ones that you could use.
*  4% is not even a million a year. She needs 10.
*  What are we going to do?
*  We got to diversify.
*  I don't have anything in the
*  stock market anymore because after
*  Barrett collapsed and I saw
*  I literally saw people that were working there for 30 years
*  lose everything. Because
*  they lost their job and
*  they were reinvested in the company.
*  Which they say you're not supposed to do
*  but this company like, Barrett like built itself
*  on being like
*  loyalty and like, you know
*  like, work for us
*  help people move ahead and then
*  they'd reinvest back into the company.
*  You get stocks, like all this stuff
*  and then you lost your job and the
*  stock price went from $130 to $2.
*  You're fucked.
*  Did it help you when everything crashed
*  to give you a jump to get into stand up
*  and go balls out?
*  No. Sorry for the male expression.
*  How dare you?
*  Sorry to gender.
*  Yeah, because you can't say labia out.
*  That's very weird.
*  What can you say? Clit out?
*  I went real clit out on this.
*  That might be a new thing.
*  That sounds bad coming out of my little mouth.
*  Oh my god.
*  No, it was like, I was cheap.
*  I was relatively cheap labor compared to
*  everyone else. I knew I wasn't going to lose my job.
*  I also came up with a
*  Microsoft Access program
*  that we used in the department that no one
*  else knew how to use.
*  So you kind of had your job
*  locked in. But the company could
*  go under. The company could go under but
*  I was still in the early enough
*  phase that like, I
*  I had no idea what this whole comedy
*  thing was going to turn into.
*  Did it give you motivation?
*  Like knowing that all these people that did
*  work hard towards a legitimate career
*  that it could all fall apart on them?
*  I mean, that scarred
*  me I think in a different way where
*  I was just like, oh you can't
*  you can't trust the stock
*  market. Like that's, it more put
*  me, like it didn't make me worry about like my
*  career or anything like that. Like
*  I was, I think I was too
*  young to think about longevity career
*  wise. And I was too new
*  in comedy to think it was like
*  that could all fall apart.
*  I was, I didn't assume it was
*  going to go anywhere anyway.
*  And, but it really did. Like people
*  always like, well you should be invested. You should be at Mike.
*  They're like, no, over time.
*  I'm like, no, I know all the sayings.
*  But if it crashes when you want
*  to retire, it
*  doesn't matter.
*  Like if you're 60 or whatever it is
*  and you want to retire and you're 401k
*  just completely drops.
*  Then you gotta wait
*  what, 10 more years to retire until
*  it gets back up to where it was.
*  So you know, keep it in
*  cash baby.
*  So that's what you do now? Yeah. You got a safe at home?
*  Every now and then you throw the money on the
*  bed and just roll it in?
*  Every once in a while. Decent proposal.
*  How bad would that be? Like you're like, I'm just
*  going to roll around in this money and then afterwards you're
*  like, I gotta clean up all this
*  money. Not only that, you test positive
*  for cocaine. Yeah, you got
*  like, you got every germ. Yeah,
*  if you're naked and you're rolling around with money,
*  ew, that's fucking gross.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't even like
*  I like wash my hands
*  after I touch money. You should. Yeah.
*  It's disgusting. I mean, it's
*  everyone's carrying it. Yeah.
*  So it's something that
*  we know people touch. It's like
*  one of the one things that you know
*  has been passed on from person to
*  person to person to person. Very few objects
*  like a watch or a light.
*  Very few objects touched by as many
*  people as money. Yeah. And often.
*  And strangers. Yeah. Dirty
*  people. It's on the ground.
*  Yes. It's in a machine.
*  Yes. It's gross.
*  And the numbers of people
*  that get dollar bills that
*  test positive for cocaine, it's crazy.
*  It's off the charts. Really? Yeah.
*  They did some study on hundred dollar bills.
*  Like the percentage of hundred dollar bills
*  test positive for cocaine.
*  It's really high. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's really high. Yeah. I mean,
*  I guess it would be hundreds. Yeah. Hundreds in circulation.
*  You're trying to impress people.
*  I don't give a fuck. I'm going to lay down
*  on fire when I'm done. Woo. Did you see that
*  Walmart sweater that they got in trouble for?
*  Yeah. The cocaine Santa. Yeah. The cocaine Santa.
*  I like that one. They're so lame
*  they didn't even know what the fuck it was. Yeah.
*  They were like, no, it's snow.
*  No, no, no. Stupid. He's got a straw in his hand.
*  What's the percentage
*  of dollar bills?
*  Does it say?
*  Yeah, but. What?
*  It's not legit?
*  Fecal matter showed up more in cocaine.
*  Yeah. It's a lot of poop.
*  Of course. Dirty
*  people wipe their hands with their own
*  hands. Just smudge it on
*  their dollar bills. Maybe they wipe their ass with dollar bills
*  when they run out of toilet paper.
*  Then they wash the dollar bill off in the sink, but do a
*  shitty job of it. Pardon the pun.
*  I mean, if you did run out of toilet paper.
*  Yeah. It'd be good. It's probably solid.
*  Clean it off in the sink.
*  It says the flu can last for up to 17 days on a dollar bill.
*  Oh, great.
*  Credit cards.
*  That's where credit cards. When people start getting sick, just pull out the credit card.
*  That's why when I was little, I ate
*  dirt, I ate boogers,
*  I ate grass. Good move.
*  And I rarely get sick. Good move.
*  Solid immune system. Solid immune system.
*  Yeah. That's why people in dirt vote. Cause I was a gross
*  child. 80%
*  for cocaine, 94%
*  according to a 2002 report for poop.
*  94%
*  How is poop getting on
*  everything? Cause people are gross.
*  Like, they always say like there's poop,
*  like there's fecal matter on like your
*  toothbrush. If it's like near you. I was like,
*  how is it getting there? People are gross.
*  We're disgusting.
*  Was it popping? What's happening?
*  Oh, we're touching railings after
*  you wash your hands. Like, I was at Disneyland,
*  this little kid was sucking on a chain.
*  Oh, no.
*  He had the chain in his mouth.
*  Like, your kid!
*  Ugh!
*  Baa! Just
*  shit chain.
*  At Disneyland. I picture someone pulling
*  that chain out of their ass. Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.
*  Rehooking it up.
*  That is my favorite ride
*  at Disneyland.
*  The shit chain.
*  He was sucking on the chain.
*  What's up?
*  Oh, that's so much. That's such a high percentage.
*  94 per poop?
*  And 80 something for coke?
*  A lot of fucking people doing coke
*  on 100 dollar bills.
*  100 different strains of bacteria for animals?
*  Unspecified domestic animals?
*  Baa!
*  Yeah. Yeah, if you wanted to
*  really spread a disease in this country,
*  spread it through money.
*  Oh, don't give people that idea.
*  Sorry. I'm more creative with my ideas. I didn't tell them the one
*  about the plane. I'll tell you afterwards.
*  I'll tell you my plane idea.
*  Yeah, you could, it would be really easy
*  if you had like cocaine
*  on dollars. You could easily
*  just put some sort of a fucking horrible disease
*  on dollars. Yeah.
*  Spread it around. There was a guy last night
*  at the Lakers game who was throwing money.
*  Just one dollar bills
*  into the crowd. And
*  people were scrambling for it. And
*  I was like, this could be
*  he could be passing anything.
*  Yeah, easily. Yeah.
*  I was like, or this is a really great way to see if
*  your counterfeit bills work.
*  Yeah. Or to get people in trouble.
*  Yeah, you fucking losers. Have ten bucks
*  for free. Yeah. Yeah, there's a
*  that's a weird thing, right? The throwing
*  money thing.
*  I'm so rich I can throw money
*  away. Throw it up in the air.
*  Making it rain. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It feels weird when you're
*  like with no specified
*  target. Right, right, right. You know? If you're
*  like, I'm so rich I'm going to give it to
*  a school. You know?
*  That would be a nice thing to do. I'm so rich I'm just going to throw it
*  in the air. Yeah.
*  It's the ultimate in frivolous spending.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean even at
*  strip clubs I can get behind it because you're like
*  oh yeah, you're paying this lady.
*  But you're making her scratch it all
*  up together. Yeah.
*  Like she's sweeping leaves.
*  It's weird.
*  I bet strippers really hate raking.
*  In the fall they're probably like
*  ugh. It's not even money. Not even money.
*  But they
*  must get money thrown at them all the time,
*  right? Oh they do. They would
*  get it crumpled. Yeah.
*  And guys would throw it. That has to be the worst.
*  Flattening it back out. Yeah.
*  Ironing.
*  You're like this isn't going to work in the vending machine.
*  That's another job
*  where there's no male equivalent
*  that's as humiliating. Because
*  like Chippendales dancers, like
*  if a guy's a Chippendales dancer it doesn't
*  even come with a stigma. No.
*  It's like he's a good looking guy with a six pack
*  and wants to make some money. Yeah. Puts his hog
*  in a tube and starts dancing for ladies with cowboy boots
*  on. It's normal.
*  No one cares. Like hey
*  our boyfriend used to be a Chippendales dancer.
*  Yeah, I'll pay my way through college. I mean it's a
*  real testament to how
*  much better women's
*  bodies are. Like we're just
*  like, like the male
*  body's like, I mean I'm attracted
*  to it. But like it's still just like
*  it's not something I want to see dancing
*  around necessarily. It's a weird thing.
*  Guys dancing is feminine too.
*  It's like a guy's just sitting there dancing
*  in front of you. It's like what are you doing? Yeah.
*  Like you know when women are dancing
*  they're letting you know, you could fuck
*  me. Yeah. But you know you could
*  fuck the guy. Guys will fuck anything.
*  It's so easy. I always say like you
*  want to fuck a guy, be the last one there.
*  Just be the one who goes, I'm ready to fuck.
*  He's like, oh you're ready to fuck. Okay.
*  Let's get out of here.
*  It's also like, it's so
*  we're just attracted to different things too.
*  Like you know like yeah, we like attractive
*  men but like you want to get us?
*  Like show us you're capable
*  of things.
*  Yeah that's hot.
*  Like your life is so fucked up
*  that you're a Chippendales dancer. We're like
*  yeah. I'm just like ugh.
*  How come you don't have your shit together? You're 35.
*  Yeah like can't you be like an accountant
*  or something?
*  You have a full beard. You should have a real job.
*  Yeah.
*  You're a fucking real
*  grown up man.
*  Why are you dancing?
*  Why are you dancing? Like where did this go wrong
*  for you? Do you own a house?
*  Like stop it. It's such a different reaction
*  too. Like when girls go to see men strip
*  or men dancing, they scream.
*  They're screaming and yelling.
*  Guys are just sitting there looking creepy. Guys are
*  sitting back like this. They're like
*  ugh, your posture.
*  It's a reverse of roles for guys.
*  Like the women are aggressive because they want to
*  make money. Like would you like a dance? Would you like a dance?
*  Like the women are coming up to you.
*  You're like whoa, this is crazy.
*  They're coming up to me. Yeah. And it's like
*  yeah, cause you're pinging them.
*  How? Why do you have to get all technical
*  on it? What do you think would change
*  in society if prostitution was legal?
*  Um.
*  I think it would be a lot less guys
*  that are stressed. I think there would be
*  yeah, I mean I. People would probably
*  be a little nicer. I think people would be nicer.
*  I think those women would finally get like
*  like there would be like they could have like a union.
*  Yeah. You know like they could
*  Not really. Hose would just break
*  union lines.
*  I want to be at a prostitute union meeting.
*  I really do. I really
*  Y'all are charging
*  too little.
*  Uh
*  They're like I'm not giving my fees.
*  The healthcare was not good this year.
*  You fucking bitches need to step up.
*  Could you imagine
*  what it would be like being at a prostitution meeting
*  all smoking.
*  I gotta get out of this fucking job.
*  This job is fucking bullshit. But there's also like one
*  woman in like a skirt and heels who's just
*  like we're not all
*  like that, okay? Some of
*  us, we're the
*  classy ones. Like there's the classy
*  versus the unclassy side of the room.
*  I knew a girl who in
*  college she was uh
*  she was a prostitute
*  but she was a prostitute like
*  she would fuck guys she knew
*  for money and she didn't want to get a job
*  and she liked these guys.
*  They were like older married guys
*  and she was trying to explain it.
*  And I was like oh okay so you like
*  you knew the guys and you would
*  fuck them for money. She's an artist.
*  And she was explaining the whole thing.
*  I was like oh okay. Well that's an argument
*  that comes up a lot where there's some women
*  who say that like
*  no I want to do this.
*  Well if you want, look
*  imagine if you're a woman right and you're in
*  college and some guy says I will
*  pay you $2,000
*  to have sex.
*  It'll take about an hour.
*  Versus you have to work
*  for hours and hours and hours and hours
*  and hours. And the guy's a nice guy.
*  And you let you go oh okay
*  he's like this nice business man
*  and he can't get laid. Like you maybe would have done it anyway.
*  Yeah, probably not.
*  But either way it's not the worst thing
*  in the world. You're not disgusted by it.
*  He's not treating you terrible. He just
*  likes sexual pleasure
*  from a pretty girl and you
*  like money and then
*  next thing you know old Jed's a millionaire.
*  What is wrong with that?
*  Obviously that's best case scenario.
*  The worst case scenario I
*  think is pimps and
*  people abusing women
*  and sexual trafficking and all the stuff
*  that's associated with, the same sort of
*  thing that's associated with illegal drugs
*  is associated with illegal prostitution. Crime.
*  Organized crime. I mean that's
*  the real problem is and look I have three
*  daughters. I don't want anybody to be a prostitute.
*  But if they were going to be a prostitute
*  I would like it to be like a legal
*  thing. Not my kids. Right, right, right.
*  Some other losers kids. But if you're going to
*  have prostitution
*  if it was legal, first
*  of all why isn't it legal? How come it's
*  okay to fuck anybody you want but it's
*  not okay to pay for it? That's crazy.
*  I mean it's
*  the oldest profession. Yes.
*  So there should be something at
*  this point we should go as a society
*  hey we're not getting rid of this.
*  Let's just figure out a way
*  to make it as safe. Test
*  people. Protect them from
*  creeps. Make sure you have security.
*  But maybe that's also part of
*  why some guys like it because
*  it is illegal. Forbidden. It's dirty. It's naughty.
*  Oh it's naughty.
*  Like if you look at porn it's all naughty
*  porn that's popular now. It's all like my
*  step sister, step mother, step
*  brother. That's all it is. It's all
*  naughty stuff. It's all step stuff. It's all step.
*  Everybody step. I'm not kidding.
*  It's like those are all the titles.
*  If I did look that's what I would find.
*  It's all step. Step this and
*  step that. It's weird like people
*  want to be like and this is a site where
*  see because porn is so prevalent
*  now and it's so easily accessible.
*  Right. And it's so you can just get it on your fucking
*  phone. You're watching on the nice screen in
*  your phone. It's in 4k. You stream it
*  anytime you want. So because of that
*  we're gravitating
*  towards weirder and weirder shit.
*  Like to get our kink off.
*  Like people have to be like I can't even
*  believe we're doing this. You're supposed to be my sister.
*  Like you know.
*  I'm not your real sister. I'm just
*  your step sister. And next thing
*  they'll go. They're getting crazy.
*  I love the
*  amount of time it takes to convince
*  someone in porn. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's just always like oh five seconds.
*  Do you have a heart on it? I can't believe this.
*  How dare you. You're disgusting.
*  No. I mean no. It's like that all the time.
*  I mean I'm not even thinking anything.
*  You're my sister. This is crazy.
*  Let me see it.
*  I want to see a
*  porn that actually takes the amount
*  of time it would take to convince someone.
*  It depends on who it is. If it's a slut
*  it would be accurate. But if it's a
*  sorry to slut shame. But if it's
*  yeah like a relationship. Slet in power.
*  You just slut empowered. I don't think you're
*  shamed. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm slut empowered.
*  Some people like like a long
*  drawn out courtship toward a deal.
*  Yeah. Like some guys like
*  guys that are friends with.
*  They prefer that a girl
*  doesn't want to sleep with them quickly
*  because this way this is a girl
*  that is making good choices.
*  Yeah. Especially in your 30s
*  you start thinking about like okay this could be the one.
*  Yeah. You hear that a lot
*  of times with guys like I mean that's how they always say
*  you're supposed to play the game. It's just be like no hold
*  out for him. Hold out for him. Yeah. And it's just
*  like.
*  You don't have to. You can have
*  great relationships after a first one night
*  stand. Yeah. 100 percent. I'm pretty
*  sure it happens all the time. All the time.
*  100 percent. Yeah. But I also
*  get the appeal of it. I get it. Like
*  yeah. I know that people like to chase.
*  It's both things are
*  good. Sometimes it's good
*  to have a couple of cocktails and go fuck it let's do
*  this. Woo. Of course. Yes.
*  Why else were you drinking? Yes.
*  Well that's these moments
*  where like the universe creates
*  like especially nightclub
*  moments. Couple of cocktails.
*  The universe has it just puts
*  those little seeds out there like you look
*  at them they look at you and you're like what do
*  you think. Right. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Wow.
*  And then but then like I always think about like
*  like I live in New York. There's plenty
*  of opportunities for that. How do people
*  in other cities. Not even
*  cities towns like
*  you're at a bar.
*  What are you doing like what are the. Farmers
*  only dot com. Yeah. Is it all dating
*  app. There's a farmers website
*  dating app. I know that one.
*  Yeah. There's a commercial for it.
*  Farmers only dot com. It's like a hot girl
*  in daisy duke shorts like with a tractor
*  like please tell me how many look like that.
*  Please. Zero. Yeah. I'm sure
*  there's hot farmer girls out there
*  that live in those small towns. Of course there are.
*  Yeah. I know. I know.
*  I know a farmer from back home.
*  He's really attractive and his wife's really attractive.
*  What the hell. There you go. Yeah.
*  It's real. Yeah.
*  They fucking work too
*  hard. They work really hard for not a lot
*  of money. It's a difficult. That's
*  like a whole government. Yeah.
*  And it's you know they have to
*  like mind their books carefully.
*  It's I mean and then
*  then part of it's just dependent on like
*  the weather that year.
*  You work so hard and then all of a sudden it just
*  doesn't rain. How about farmers
*  all my nacks like what in
*  the fuck is that.
*  You can predict the rain two years
*  from now like they have these books
*  where they're like back before
*  they had like real weather satellites. Yeah.
*  Farmer's all my nacks. And they're accurate
*  for the most part. How is that possible.
*  I don't know. I don't understand. What kind of voodoo
*  are they using. It sounds like witchery.
*  This is the thing like there's a lot of things you hear
*  from back then where people got you know
*  people said they were witches and then you're like
*  yeah but how did they know.
*  What do you know what that whole witch trial shit was about?
*  I don't know. It was about ergot.
*  It was about late frosts.
*  When you have late frosts a lot of
*  like wheat in particular
*  develops fungus and that fungus
*  is ergot. It's one of the funguses that
*  could grow on it and ergot produces
*  lysergic acid
*  produces a very LSD like
*  effect. So these people were getting acid
*  from the bread. So people
*  were tripping balls and freaking
*  out and thinking that you know and also
*  it's always women right.
*  It's always men burning women.
*  It wasn't a warlock hunt.
*  It was a witch hunt.
*  So it was like this bitch she did it to me.
*  She's using witchcraft.
*  It was I bet a lot of it
*  was men who were attracted to
*  women and those women weren't attracted to
*  them and they were angry and then they were on acid.
*  And then they were like oh my god she's a witch and then
*  they were paranoid and they believed in witches
*  back then. They believed in witchcraft and why
*  wouldn't you if you're on acid eating bread
*  you didn't even know. And all of a sudden you're like
*  I'm bewitched. I have been
*  bewitched. Also it's a much
*  better excuse for your wife.
*  When you're like no she bewitched
*  me. She's a witch. She's a witch.
*  There's no way women aren't going to turn on each other immediately.
*  They never burnt them though.
*  That was a misnomer. Is that a lie? Yeah
*  they used to drown them which is kind of more fucked up.
*  Well my favorite thing, not my favorite thing
*  my favorite thing in the world. Drowning witches.
*  I can hold them. I hold their hair. It was one
*  of those things where it's like
*  load her with rocks
*  and if she sinks she's not a witch.
*  Oh that's right. But then she's dead
*  because she sank to the bottom.
*  And then we feel bad. So then we're like oh she wasn't
*  a witch. Ah let's give her a nice
*  burial.
*  But then if they put a bunch of rocks
*  on you and you floated you were
*  a witch and so then they killed you.
*  Oh boy. But I'm going to guess they never found
*  ones that didn't sink to the bottom.
*  Can you imagine if you had to live back then
*  forget about all the smells and the syphilis
*  and all the fucking powdered wigs.
*  Then they're fucking drowning witches.
*  Like Christ.
*  Yeah and then like also you just have kids
*  and they just keep dying.
*  Oh yeah. Like you die.
*  Everyone's dying. Everyone was always
*  dying. Well that's also the
*  whole life expectancy thing.
*  There were people that's like
*  someone that, my friend Chris Ryan
*  explained that to me. When people think that
*  people back in like
*  the 1200's only
*  lived to be 30 years old. Right.
*  On average. Just because of infant mortality.
*  Exactly. So there's so much infant mortality
*  and childhood mortality that it like
*  lowered that, that the life expectancy
*  way low. Yeah people were living in the 60's
*  and 70's. It's just that
*  all the babies were also dying.
*  There's a great, there's a
*  book by Steven Pinker. I can't remember
*  the name of it is
*  Escaping Me. But it's a
*  it's a really good book about like
*  oh my god why can't I think of the name.
*  Can you look
*  up a Steven Pinker book?
*  And it just essentially talks
*  about like how things are actually
*  cause you know people always say good old days
*  and how things are getting exponentially better
*  and will continue to get better. Yeah he was on
*  recently. Oh he was? Yeah yeah.
*  About five, six months ago. He's great. I really
*  like him. I love his work. I love Outliers.
*  Oh that's Malcolm Gladwell. I love that too.
*  He was on recently too. He was on much more recently.
*  He was on like a couple weeks ago. But Pinker's
*  excellent. He's just, his
*  work. Enlightenment Now? Yes.
*  Yeah he gets massive push back on that.
*  That's what's interesting because he's saying that everything's
*  better. That there's less violence. There's less
*  crime. There's less rape. There's less
*  all these things. And he shows it statistically.
*  And people are like you're belittling
*  all the horrible crimes that take place
*  and you're enabling
*  all these assholes to try to say
*  things are fine and to not be
*  protesting about all these issues.
*  Like no just using statistics.
*  And he's not like
*  it's again what makes me bad about like the
*  social justice stuff is that he's not saying
*  don't try to keep making
*  things better. No. No. No. Don't try to like
*  yeah there are things we should protest. He's just
*  saying that like no statistically
*  we're headed in the right
*  direction. Yes. And then he even talks
*  about anomalies where we do go backwards
*  sometimes. Yes. But like this is
*  all stuff where it's like
*  if you don't want to know the actual information
*  don't get in the fight to begin with.
*  Yeah and don't look at statistics. People
*  don't want to know facts anymore. They
*  want to go based off their feelings. That's a lot
*  of what happens when you talk about women
*  not being as strong as men.
*  With sports. Yeah with sports. Like where women
*  other people or
*  men who are like trying to fight for women
*  they're like
*  they want it to not be true. They want
*  men and women to be the same as good
*  as each other in sports. And it's like
*  just because you want it
*  it doesn't mean it's true. Well very few
*  people say that but something
*  that people do say is that
*  a trans woman is equal
*  to a biological woman.
*  And then that argument
*  is horse shit. Yeah. And that argument
*  has been disproved by all these women that are winning
*  world records. And they say well there's
*  outliers in sports
*  period. So that these
*  people that are athletic anomalies like
*  Michael Jordan or whoever you know people
*  that are just supreme genetic
*  athletes. So do you discount
*  them? But no
*  they're coming from a different gender you fucking
*  idiot. Yeah. Like you can't do that.
*  Like I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to find
*  some loophole where it makes
*  sense where a six foot six man
*  can play girls basketball. Right.
*  But you can't because 90%
*  of the population that's not on Twitter
*  the regular people are going to go hey fuck
*  you. And that's what's going on right now.
*  People are going hey fuck you. Because this is crazy.
*  Yeah. Martina Navatolova
*  they're calling her a bigot. They went after her.
*  She's a famous lesbian.
*  And they're calling her a bigot.
*  She's transphobic. Martina and her transphobic
*  transphobic comments.
*  She just wants
*  things to be competitive. Have a trans
*  only league. Yeah. You're welcome.
*  Super simple. And like people are like
*  it's not fair that it has to be
*  separated. Yes it is. Yeah it is
*  fair. That's why men and women are separated.
*  Well this is the argument that I got with this guy on the show.
*  He was saying that there's not that much difference
*  between men and women. I go okay so you think women
*  should be able to compete with men.
*  In sports. He's like well I'm not
*  really saying that. I'm like well that's exactly what you're saying.
*  Do you think that it's okay if women
*  compete against men in weightlifting and in
*  basketball. How well do you think that would work out for women?
*  How well do you think it would work out in track and field?
*  How well do you think it would work out in anything?
*  It's nonsense. There's a reason why there's a difference
*  where we define men's sports
*  and women's sports. For fairness.
*  So we should have trans only sports.
*  That way just fucking like
*  if there's that many of them
*  let's have trans only. You're going to
*  find out how few there really are.
*  That's going to be really weird.
*  Exactly. But it's also like is it not fair
*  that they have to have their own
*  league. I mean maybe but also
*  none of this is fair.
*  It's not like
*  I don't think it's not fair if they have their own
*  league. I think it's the only thing that's fair.
*  Yeah. Well and it's like none of us
*  have made any of these choices.
*  We're all born the way we're born.
*  Right. If you're a
*  trans person and you were born a
*  man but you've always believed
*  that you're a woman. That's
*  also not fair. You know
*  like that's like that's a crazy
*  predicament to be put into. Sure. Yeah.
*  But that doesn't mean
*  I want you competing with me because you're
*  going to destroy me.
*  Yeah. It's not fair. It's not fair.
*  Um.
*  We know it is fair. Right.
*  Your Kami special that's on Netflix right now.
*  Is that a good segue?
*  Nah. It's terrible. Stop lying.
*  What's it called again? Joke Show.
*  It's on right now right?
*  Tuesday? Yeah. Tuesday. So tonight at midnight.
*  Tonight at midnight. Oh.
*  Exciting. Yeah I'm really excited for people to see it.
*  I've seen clips of it. It's very funny.
*  Thank you. You're very funny. Thank you. I'm really happy
*  that you came on the show. Me too. It was fucking awesome.
*  Thanks. Yeah I want I mean I think
*  out of the Correspondence Center all these people think I'm
*  just a political comic.
*  And I'm like I'll write jokes
*  for any topic. Yeah.
*  Like
*  but I don't like I don't like telling
*  political jokes. But it was kind of cool the
*  Correspondence Dinner
*  thing because that put you on the map.
*  Yeah. I'm very happy I
*  did it. Don't get me wrong. And I stand
*  by those jokes to this day. They were great jokes.
*  Thanks. You got the president to tweet
*  at you. Yeah. I mean come on.
*  Was it disconcerting
*  when that was happening? I just
*  remember that when he tweeted at me I
*  like cause he tweeted once
*  after the dinner and then sometime in like later
*  in the year like months after.
*  And I was doing like I was doing
*  a show in Brooklyn. I don't have Twitter
*  on my phone.
*  You don't? No. I only have it on my
*  computer. And I
*  was out in Brooklyn to do shows and I
*  was like drinking hot toddies
*  because I think I was like feeling a little under the weather
*  and I was like this will fix it.
*  And I was
*  someone I kept getting messages about
*  this tweet and I was like what what's going
*  on what's happening. And
*  then I finally saw what happened and I was
*  like well I guess I gotta go home so I can
*  tweet something back.
*  Go home after you've been
*  drinking to tweet back at the president.
*  I'm like three hot toddies in
*  and I'm just like alright what can I say.
*  What was
*  your be best? You said something when you fucking
*  roasted him. We actually said
*  it on the podcast.
*  Just now? No no no we actually
*  when you did it we were howling.
*  We said what you
*  said on the podcast. He said something about
*  when he I don't remember the exact
*  tweet he sent me but it was like
*  so called comedian
*  did such a terrible job. Oh yeah.
*  I bet you'd be on my side if I
*  had killed a journalist.
*  And that was right after
*  that was during the Khashoggi stuff
*  or whatever it was. The
*  Saudi journalists
*  that had been murdered.
*  This is what he said so
*  called comedian Michelle Wolf by the way
*  best fucking that is like
*  some of the best publicity you could ever get.
*  The president says this
*  bomb so badly last year at the White House
*  Correspondence Dinner. First of all not true
*  you can go listen to the recordings
*  people were laughing like
*  come on this is so crazy you say
*  that bomb so badly. Play it back.
*  Let's play it back. Huh what's all that
*  noise? There was parts of it where
*  people got kind of quiet but
*  I remember I was like first of all
*  this is for the audience at home.
*  But also it's like it's one of those
*  rooms where you're like yeah
*  this thing
*  at best there it feels
*  fine. Right. You know like it's like a
*  corporate gig. Exactly a corporate
*  gig. They will have an author
*  instead of a comedian. What a great idea.
*  Good first step and come
*  back of a dying evening in tradition.
*  Maybe I will go question mark.
*  Imagine that like maybe
*  I'll go. What do you think? Oh please
*  Donald I have my new
*  MAGA hat for that event.
*  I love this because I don't
*  know if he wrote this tweet though because the
*  grammar is so perfect.
*  That I'm like
*  Right the dash between
*  so and called. Yeah it just feels
*  like I was like did someone else draft this?
*  Could be.
*  But maybe I will go. Look at correspondence
*  there's the correct apostrophe
*  after the S. Yeah
*  it feels like I don't know
*  maybe he dictated this one
*  and someone was like I'm going to spell
*  everything right. Yeah well
*  they've done various things
*  to try to stop him. This is 2018
*  they've done various things
*  to try to slow down his use of Twitter
*  and social media and I do
*  think that there was a time when someone else was handling it.
*  Yeah. Yeah but
*  now I think he just fucking goes guns blazing
*  pops two Adderalls in a Sudafed
*  and just starts fucking thumbing it.
*  Two Adderalls in a Sudafed.
*  Just gets after
*  it. You know.
*  It's fucking wild to see. I had a dream last night
*  and I forgot about it until we started
*  talking about it. That he was
*  battle rapping and that
*  some woman made a rap about him
*  and then he made a rap back at her. I had a dream.
*  Maybe it's because I knew you were coming in here
*  and we were probably going to talk about it.
*  What a weird fucking dream. And his battle rap
*  was pretty good. Yeah.
*  And people were like that is pretty fucking good.
*  Like it was a good battle rap.
*  He says stuff sometimes where you're like
*  that's like bars.
*  You know. Yes. But then there's other times
*  where you're like
*  wait but he's the president. I wish he
*  wasn't the president because sometimes the shit he says
*  is hilarious. When he put a fucking giant
*  Trump Tower on Greenland when they were talking
*  about whether or not we were going to buy
*  Greenland. He goes I promise not to do this.
*  And he shows Greenland with a giant
*  gold Trump Tower. He tweeted
*  that. The president. That's fucking hilarious.
*  It's funny and then you're also
*  like come on why are you president?
*  Like anytime he holds up a graph of any sort I'm just like this is great.
*  There's no y-axis you know.
*  Like it's always stuff where you're just like
*  this is amazing. Why are you president?
*  Yeah. I don't know
*  if there's a better person to
*  represent how crazy today
*  is though. Yeah. Like if you wanted to look
*  at like the personification.
*  Yeah. Yes.
*  And on that note.
*  Michelle Wolf thank you very much. Your
*  Netflix special will be by the time people hear this
*  a little bit out later today but the
*  actual special will be
*  Tuesday night at midnight
*  or midnight tonight. Midnight Pacific.
*  Midnight Monday night. Midnight Monday night yeah.
*  Right so Tuesday it's out.
*  So you hear this it's out. Most likely it's out.
*  Go get it. Go get it bitches.
*  Alright. Thank you. Thanks for having me.
*  It was fun. It was fun. I loved it.
*  Thank you so much.
