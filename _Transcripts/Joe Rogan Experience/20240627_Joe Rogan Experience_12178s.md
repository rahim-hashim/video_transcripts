# Joe Rogan Experience #1954 - Bert Kreischer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=6.0s)]
*  Hey, we're up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=10.0s)]
*  What a great fucking night last night. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=14.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah it was. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=17.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, I woke up bubbling. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=18.0s)]
*  Yeah, I felt so good. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=21.0s)]
*  And last night was my first time in a managerial position. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=22.0s)]
*  Like I just came to hang out, make sure everything ran smooth for your show. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=27.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=32.0s)]
*  Like to be at my own club where one of my best friends is headlining and all my other [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=33.0s)]
*  friends are opening for him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=40.0s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=42.0s)]
*  It was a pretty fucking sick lineup. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=43.0s)]
*  This is what's crazy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=44.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=45.0s)]
*  If you said this 10 years ago, in Austin, Texas, the lineup that was on last night was [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=46.0s)]
*  insane. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=52.0s)]
*  We've been doing that a lot though. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=53.0s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=54.0s)]
*  Like every these Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday shows that we've been doing out here, they're [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=55.0s)]
*  just stacked. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=58.0s)]
*  Dude, and then let's just say highlight of my career. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=59.0s)]
*  They're telling, they're chanting the machine and I go, I'm not going to tell it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=63.0s)]
*  And they start cheering it and I go, all right, I'll tell it if Ron White tells his tater [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=67.0s)]
*  salad story. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=71.0s)]
*  And people didn't even know he was up there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=72.0s)]
*  They go fucking crazy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=75.0s)]
*  He walks on stage. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=76.0s)]
*  I FaceTime Lee Anne. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=77.0s)]
*  I FaceTime Lee Anne, who's like Ron's her favorite comic. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=78.0s)]
*  Guy in the front rows recording Tom telling taters or shooting Lee Anne watching it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=82.0s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=87.0s)]
*  I'll tell you right now, it'll show you how quick there are holes in your act. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=88.0s)]
*  Cause then I was like, I don't think I can tell the machine right after that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=93.0s)]
*  I know you were talking about that, but no, the machine's an amazing story. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=96.0s)]
*  It's an amazing story. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=99.0s)]
*  It's just, you're just self-examining. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=100.0s)]
*  I could have sat and broken down what I love about that story for the next 15 minutes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=102.0s)]
*  I could have talked about that story. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=111.0s)]
*  No, you said that on stage. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=112.0s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=114.0s)]
*  Ron's one of the best storytellers of all time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=115.0s)]
*  Having him out here is amazing because he's like, he's such a like a, he's like the statesman [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=117.0s)]
*  of comedy out here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=122.0s)]
*  And he's so respected. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=124.0s)]
*  And he's such a good person. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=126.0s)]
*  He almost made me cry last night. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=128.0s)]
*  At the end of the night, I'm pretty loaded and he comes up and he was like, he was like, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=130.0s)]
*  thanks for bringing, that was really fun. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=134.0s)]
*  And he goes, I just came out to watch you tonight. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=136.0s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=138.0s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I came out to watch you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=139.0s)]
*  I'm a fan. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=141.0s)]
*  And I was like, bro, you can't say that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=142.0s)]
*  Like, that fucking killed me. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=144.0s)]
*  I was like, if there's careers that I've looked at and wanted to emulate, it's him, Attell, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=146.0s)]
*  you know, those guys are the fucking my goats, you know? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=151.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, everybody loves Ron. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=157.0s)]
*  Like, I've never met a comic that doesn't think Ron White's funny. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=159.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=162.0s)]
*  They don't exist. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=163.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=164.0s)]
*  I remember Leanne's a redneck and when the Blue Collar Comedy Tour came out, we went [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=165.0s)]
*  and watched it in Hollywood at the Arclight. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=170.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=172.0s)]
*  And she was fucking, Leanne likes two things. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=173.0s)]
*  Blue collar comedy and fucking Steve Harvey. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=177.0s)]
*  If she's going to cheat on me, she's going to fuck Steve Harvey. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=180.0s)]
*  I can guarantee you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=183.0s)]
*  She sends me clips of Steve Harvey. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=184.0s)]
*  Every morning there's a clip. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=186.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=188.0s)]
*  For the movie, when the movie's coming out, they asked us to do Family Feud. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=189.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=194.0s)]
*  And now Leanne has never pushed our girls into anything, but she said, I like Grace [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=195.0s)]
*  Chrysler, you're doing Family Feud. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=199.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck what you say. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=201.0s)]
*  Does Steve Harvey know this? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=203.0s)]
*  That his wife has a crush on him? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=204.0s)]
*  Oh, she has no idea. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=205.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen Steve Harvey eat, someone made like collard green dumplings or something [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=206.0s)]
*  and he goes, takes a bite and he freezes and he goes, now I'm having a Black People moment [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=213.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=218.0s)]
*  He's the fucking greatest. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=219.0s)]
*  Leanne's obsessed with him. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=221.0s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=222.0s)]
*  Isn't it funny that no one has done like a movie tour like that since? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=223.0s)]
*  You know, they had Kings of Comedy, Blue Collar Tour, and then nothing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=227.0s)]
*  Those were so successful. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=232.0s)]
*  The Four People Tour is the key. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=234.0s)]
*  I do Fully Loaded. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=237.0s)]
*  We bring eight for Fully Loaded. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=238.0s)]
*  And like per show. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=240.0s)]
*  We switch it up. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=242.0s)]
*  Have you ordered the lineup this year? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=243.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=244.0s)]
*  Louis Black, David Tell, Chad Daniels, Shane Gillis, Mark Norman, Big Jay Ogerson, Dan [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=245.0s)]
*  Soder, Fortune Feimster, Tammy Pescatelli. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=252.0s)]
*  All on one show? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=255.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=256.0s)]
*  We split. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=257.0s)]
*  Stavros is on it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=258.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=259.0s)]
*  We got a fucking sick lineup. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=260.0s)]
*  Fucking look at this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=262.0s)]
*  Tiffany Haddish. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=264.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=265.0s)]
*  Jim Norton. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=266.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=267.0s)]
*  Jay Farrow, Rosebud, Ralph Barbosa. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=268.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=272.0s)]
*  This fucking lineup is. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=273.0s)]
*  I just found out about Ralph Barbosa. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=274.0s)]
*  He's a funny dude. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=276.0s)]
*  He's real funny. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=277.0s)]
*  I watched some of his clips and then I found out that there was some sort of a thing with [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=279.0s)]
*  George Lopez. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=282.76s)]
*  And then so I had the little bitch in me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=283.76s)]
*  Started watching some fucking beef with George Lopez and Ralph Barbosa. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=287.0s)]
*  That shit makes me sad. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=293.0s)]
*  I don't like that stupid shit like that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=294.2s)]
*  I don't like beef. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=296.88s)]
*  I don't like nonsense beef. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=297.88s)]
*  Like that's the dumbest kind of beef. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=299.6s)]
*  Like some young guy coming up beef. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=301.5s)]
*  Like you don't like. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=303.4s)]
*  I think it's just a misunderstanding. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=305.28s)]
*  I think Lopez called him up and. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=306.92s)]
*  Oh did he? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=308.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=309.92s)]
*  I guess they talked on the phone or something like that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=310.92s)]
*  It's hilarious that I know about this silly comedy beef. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=311.92s)]
*  But he's funny anyway. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=315.16s)]
*  Barbosa's a funny dude. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=317.12s)]
*  He's got a funny laid back style. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=318.12s)]
*  I think it's just generational. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=320.48s)]
*  You're talking about like I think George Lopez is like even older than Ralph's parents probably. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=321.8s)]
*  And so it's just two different styles of what you would say Mexican comedy is. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=327.32s)]
*  I don't think that's what it is. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=331.24s)]
*  I think it's just that George didn't know who he was. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=332.36s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=334.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=335.72s)]
*  I think it's just that he was like, I'm going to show him. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  Georgia brought him up. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  George brought Barbosa up. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  And he's like, who the fuck is that guy? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  You keep bringing him up. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  Nobody knows who that dude is. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  I just saw Schultz saying someone went up to Barbosa and he was like, fuck George Lopez. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah I think that's what it was. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  I think it came from him saying something on a podcast. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  But I think he was just annoyed with Trevino bringing the dude's name up over and over [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  again for whatever reason. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  He's funny as shit. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah he's funny as shit. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  He's funny as fucking shit. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah it's you know. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  Nothing bothers me more than like, and I don't think that's what he was doing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=366.08s)]
*  I think it was just like, who is that guy? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=371.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't know who that guy is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=373.4s)]
*  I don't think it was like, I don't like that guy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=374.84s)]
*  I think he just genuinely didn't know who he was. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=377.08s)]
*  But nothing bothers me more than like those old dudes that don't like the young guys coming [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=379.56s)]
*  up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=384.56s)]
*  They don't like the fact that young guys are coming up. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=385.56s)]
*  Because I remember being in that young guy position and like, oh you old cunt. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=386.56s)]
*  Like you fucking dummy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=391.08s)]
*  I'm never going to be like you one day. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=392.4s)]
*  Like if I get to your position, I'm going to be very welcoming for the young people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=394.12s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=398.2s)]
*  Like it's like a closed door once you go through it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=400.2s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=403.36s)]
*  Nobody else in. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=404.36s)]
*  No more funny. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=405.36s)]
*  No more comedians. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=407.0s)]
*  No one else is famous. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=408.32s)]
*  Just me. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=410.08s)]
*  Forever and ever and ever. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=411.36s)]
*  It was like that back then too. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=413.56s)]
*  Stingy cunts. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=415.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=416.12s)]
*  Got that fucking weird thing that people have. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=417.12s)]
*  Or they just want to be the only one that gets the attention. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=421.2s)]
*  It's so strange man. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=423.72s)]
*  It's so strange. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=424.72s)]
*  Like the fucking fierce jealousy that some people have when other people start to make [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=425.72s)]
*  it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=430.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=431.2s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=432.2s)]
*  You didn't have that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=433.2s)]
*  I think you blessed us with not having it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=434.2s)]
*  If you look at like Mark Norman and Shane Gillis, I take them when I do like Red Rocks [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=437.12s)]
*  or I do big, big venues. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=441.0s)]
*  I'll hit them up to see if they want to do it with me. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=445.32s)]
*  Trust me when I say, like we did the Super Bowl. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=446.32s)]
*  We did four shows at the Mullet Arena. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=449.68s)]
*  Four shows. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=452.08s)]
*  I love how big those guys are getting. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  I love that you went to the Mullet Arena. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  How'd you not bring Theo with you? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, he was in town that week. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  I hit him up. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  I hit him up and he was like, I think I lose my powers when I walk in there. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  That sounds like something he would say. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  Oh, he wants to move out here. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  Does he? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=472.91999999999996s)]
*  He's like a fucking vagabond. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  But he's got to have a tribe. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, a lot of these guys, they like, they didn't understand what was anchoring them [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=477.0s)]
*  in LA. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=480.52s)]
*  And one of the things that was anchoring them in LA was that we had a tribe. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=481.96s)]
*  We would all get together at the store. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=484.96s)]
*  We'd all hang out in that back bar. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  We'd all have fun together. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  We'd all laugh and joke and fuck around. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  And then we'd see each other's sets and we'd talk to each other about comedy and shit. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=492.12s)]
*  You know, Theo's, he's out alone now in Nashville. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=496.08s)]
*  What's he doing in Nashville? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=498.64s)]
*  He just decided he had to get the fuck out of LA for his mental health. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  And so he wanted to be like a more laid back place. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=504.58s)]
*  And Nashville clicked with him. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=507.08s)]
*  He is all over my algorithm. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=509.0s)]
*  He shows up and it's gay dudes, boat crashes, and Theo. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=512.0s)]
*  With me, it's girls with giant asses doing squats. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=518.48s)]
*  It's all like CrossFit ladies with six packs. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  Those girls, those girls will inspire me to work out. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=525.8199999999999s)]
*  There's something about a fucking jack chick with big thighs. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=528.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I like. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=531.24s)]
*  My God. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=532.24s)]
*  I like a guy who can help you move a couch. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=533.24s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=535.24s)]
*  I like I'm sturdy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=536.92s)]
*  My wife does not like it when I say that by the way. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=537.92s)]
*  I just like when I call her sturdy. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=541.96s)]
*  But she's strong. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=543.96s)]
*  She's strong. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=544.96s)]
*  I like strong women. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=545.96s)]
*  I like it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=547.96s)]
*  I don't like, you know, I just don't think that, like the weak, like, waify sort of, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=549.96s)]
*  like some people are into that weak sort of waify looking thing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=559.24s)]
*  Like that doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=561.72s)]
*  No. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=563.72s)]
*  I like an older woman too now. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=564.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=565.72s)]
*  I can imagine dating a girl who's 20 now. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=566.72s)]
*  Like what? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=570.88s)]
*  Like when I see Leonardo DiCaprio going out with a 19 year old, I'm like, bro, what do [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=571.88s)]

*  What? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=578.28s)]
*  I mean, what do you talk about? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=579.28s)]
*  Unless she's the most genius, brilliant, world traveled, nuanced. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=580.28s)]
*  Dude, my assistant's 25 and I'll say things to him and he'll go, I have no idea what you're [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=585.64s)]
*  talking about. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=590.68s)]
*  Like you reference a movie like Ace Ventura and he's like, ah, what is that? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=591.68s)]
*  Jim Carrey? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=596.16s)]
*  I don't know who that is. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=597.16s)]
*  I was on stage last night and he had a Three Stooges reference and no one laughed. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=598.76s)]
*  I'm like, Jim, you're 55. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=601.52s)]
*  Like these people do not know who the fuck Three Stooges is. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  Why don't you just say Laurel and Hardy? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=607.76s)]
*  Go even deeper into the old school comedy people. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=614.68s)]
*  I couldn't live that life where you couldn't make references to the things you grew up [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=615.68s)]
*  on. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=618.48s)]
*  Well, you can. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=619.48s)]
*  You know, it's like Dennis Miller always used to have references that nobody knew what the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=620.48s)]
*  fuck he was saying. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  You had to catch up. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=625.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it seems like the gap of experience and what we know has gotten so closer where [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=627.76s)]
*  it wasn't that way. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=635.96s)]
*  I feel like my dad and I still knew all the same references, whereas my daughter and I [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=636.96s)]
*  do not. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=641.84s)]
*  They don't know anything that I've ever lived or experienced. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  And then they'll say things to me like, have you ever heard of the band Tool? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=646.08s)]
*  And I'm like, are you being fucking serious? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=648.96s)]
*  Are you being serious? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  I buy the guys fucking wine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  You kidding me? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=654.32s)]
*  And then like the other day, I said to me, you ever heard of Alice in Chains? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=655.32s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, that was like what I went to college to. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=663.44s)]
*  But I knew Queen's Clearwater Revival. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=666.96s)]
*  I knew the Sean Anas. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=669.36s)]
*  I knew all the stuff my dad listened to. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=671.0400000000001s)]
*  I knew Sam Cooke. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=672.9200000000001s)]
*  I knew those songs. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=674.0s)]
*  My daughters have no fucking clue of any of that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=675.44s)]
*  We also have to think about just the landscape of information that's available to them as [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=678.4000000000001s)]
*  opposed to what it was for you. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=682.72s)]
*  When you were growing up, the stuff that you got was off the radio or off television. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=685.0799999999999s)]
*  Like that's it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=689.68s)]
*  So you heard it, either you heard it at a place or you listened to it on a radio or [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=690.9599999999999s)]
*  you bought a CD. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=696.04s)]
*  With these kids, they're getting inundated constantly. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  And they're also getting songs that are like snippets off of reels on Instagram or those [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=701.38s)]
*  little TikTok videos. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=706.56s)]
*  You're getting what's that song? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=708.12s)]
*  And then you find the song and then you listen to it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=709.64s)]
*  Just the landscape of shit that's available to them is so goddamn different. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=712.1600000000001s)]
*  How could they pay attention to all of it? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=719.36s)]
*  How could they look at the old stuff? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  It's like just the stuff that's available. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=723.9200000000001s)]
*  And by the way, for them, shit from 2010 is old. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=726.44s)]
*  You know how crazy that is? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=730.32s)]
*  When I was in high school, okay? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=732.6800000000001s)]
*  What year were you in high school? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=734.64s)]
*  1981 was my freshman year in high school. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=735.64s)]
*  In my freshman year in high school, I remember there was a guy in my neighborhood that had [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=738.12s)]
*  a 1955 Chevy. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=744.32s)]
*  It was this fucking awesome car. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=747.8000000000001s)]
*  This awesome 55 black Chevy that was like in mint condition. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=750.84s)]
*  And I remember thinking, wow, that car is so fucking old. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=756.36s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=759.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=761.76s)]
*  But that car was only 15 years old. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=762.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=764.72s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=765.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=766.72s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=767.72s)]
*  If you think now about a 15-year-old car, I have a 15-year-old car. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=769.52s)]
*  I have a 2007 Porsche. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=773.88s)]
*  I love that car. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=776.4s)]
*  I drive it all the time. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=777.4s)]
*  That car is old as fuck, man. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  In that world, to kids, when I was in high school, a 55 Chevy was like this old classic. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what my car is. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=789.76s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=791.8000000000001s)]
*  The timelines are weird now. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  My favorite car is a 1972 El Dorado, the convertible Cadillac. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=796.76s)]
*  And that's fucking 50 years old. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=801.24s)]
*  By the way, I'm off by 10 years. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=803.0s)]
*  It's a 25-year-old car. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=804.0s)]
*  25, yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=805.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=806.48s)]
*  What I'm thinking about is that and my mom had a 1970 Barracuda. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=807.48s)]
*  This is where I'm fucking it up in my head. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=811.6s)]
*  My mom had a 1970 Barracuda when I was in high school. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=813.2s)]
*  And all my friends were in love with it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=815.6s)]
*  They were like, oh my God. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=817.8000000000001s)]
*  They would see my mom's car. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  It's your mom's car. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=820.1600000000001s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=821.6s)]
*  Because a 1971 Barracuda was like it had like these grill, the front grill looked like [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=822.84s)]
*  a fish, like almost like gills. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=829.96s)]
*  Like look at that car. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=832.76s)]
*  My mom had one of those in 1981. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=834.2s)]
*  So I was a freshman in high school and my mom had had it for quite a while. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=838.24s)]
*  But like that car in 1981 was only 10 years old. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=842.88s)]
*  It was only 10 years old. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=848.72s)]
*  So that's a 2013 car. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=851.0s)]
*  A 2013 car is indistinguishable from a 2023 car. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=854.12s)]
*  Like if you see a 2013 Lexus, like they're the same. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=859.36s)]
*  But that to everybody about that car. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=863.24s)]
*  Look at that fucking car. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=866.24s)]
*  Look at that fucking car. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=867.76s)]
*  What a car. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=868.76s)]
*  I tried to buy one of those. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=869.76s)]
*  And my God, you need one of those. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=871.36s)]
*  I want one so bad. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=873.04s)]
*  You should get one of those and get it done so it's got modern brakes and shit and modern [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=874.04s)]
*  engine. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=877.68s)]
*  That should be a project that you get behind. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=879.0s)]
*  A Burt Kreischer 1972 Cadillac convertible. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=881.28s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=886.3599999999999s)]
*  I was going to buy one and use it because this is the way my brain works. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=887.3599999999999s)]
*  Use it to promote my special. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=890.0s)]
*  So if you just put razzle dazzle all over the side of it, drive it around LA, that's [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  the way my brain works. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=896.4799999999999s)]
*  So just think about like the difference in timelines. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=897.9599999999999s)]
*  Like how different it is to like look at a 1971 car and then look at that in 1981. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=901.8s)]
*  It was already a classic. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=908.52s)]
*  And you know this two thousand and twenty three year we're living in. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=910.52s)]
*  You know if you look at things from 2000, like they don't seem that long ago. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=915.16s)]
*  But what's the here's my question. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=919.52s)]
*  It's weird technology from like a nineteen, say a nineteen sixty one car to a nineteen [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=920.8s)]
*  seventy one car. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, the seventy one car starts having automatic windows and an automatic [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=926.1999999999999s)]
*  trunk that goes that locks down. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=931.92s)]
*  The technology from those cars is exponentially bigger. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=935.2s)]
*  And you look at the car you have your Porsche compared to where they are today. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=940.32s)]
*  How different is I mean I guess they're fucking electric now. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=944.2s)]
*  Well yeah but no even the gas ones, the internal combustion engines, they have better electronics. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=947.08s)]
*  They have better suspension management systems. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=952.9200000000001s)]
*  They have better traction control. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=955.5600000000001s)]
*  They do a lot of different things now. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=958.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=960.6s)]
*  And also they have like warnings to let you know when cars are closed and shit. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=961.88s)]
*  Cars are pretty fucking incredible now. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=966.4s)]
*  Almost too incredible because they're so fast. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=968.24s)]
*  Like a regular car like my mom's car from 1970. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=971.0s)]
*  That was slow as fuck dude. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=974.72s)]
*  Really slow as fuck in comparison to a modern car. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=976.6800000000001s)]
*  Like if you get a like a regular modern day Honda Accord, it would bury my mom's car. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=979.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=985.44s)]
*  Yeah a little four cylinder piece of shit. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=986.44s)]
*  Buried. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=988.72s)]
*  Yeah those cars are not fast. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=989.72s)]
*  They're just they were fast for the time. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=992.64s)]
*  You know and then as time goes on and now you're living in this weird world where you [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=995.8000000000001s)]
*  have like the brand new Hummer which is an electric Hummer which is this giant SUV that [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=999.24s)]
*  GMC makes that goes zero to 60 in like three seconds. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1006.2s)]
*  Like that kind of performance was unheard of in cars. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1009.96s)]
*  No but how come that doesn't translate over to F1 and NASCAR? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1013.1600000000001s)]
*  Why are NASCAR still you? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1017.28s)]
*  I mean will there be a NASCAR electric series at one point? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  It would be wild if it was but they would lose all that sound. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1022.1999999999999s)]
*  I think that's part of the thing that people like. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1025.44s)]
*  Wow wow. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1027.68s)]
*  Can you imagine going to it? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1028.68s)]
*  Tom and I went to the Daytona 500 and it can you imagine being silent? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1029.68s)]
*  All you would hear is the chatter of the fans. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1035.04s)]
*  That would be so fucking creepy. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1037.6s)]
*  Dumb conversations. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1041.36s)]
*  It's like have you ever seen how I met your mother without the laugh track on? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1042.36s)]

*  It's something good about that because it allows you to reset and just think about things and [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1883.8s)]
*  out of the pattern of your life. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1888.2s)]

*  I got to figure out how to put it together. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1917.96s)]
*  I need a couple of tense pole stories. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1919.56s)]
*  But for me I'm always working to a special. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1921.64s)]

*  this material started in January 2020. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1930.52s)]
*  And then I did the drive-in movie theater tour. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1934.76s)]
*  I couldn't sit at home during the pandemic. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1936.76s)]
*  I was like I got to come up something. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1938.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1939.8s)]

*  And then once I get material going, I'm like let's get on the road. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1973.8s)]
*  Let's fucking get this shit good. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1976.6s)]
*  And then once I get ready for a special, once I know I have a date on a special, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1978.12s)]
*  I mean I'm so obsessive compulsive. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1982.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think people look at me and they think I'm a moron [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1984.3600000000001s)]
*  because I take my shirt off and I drink a lot. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1986.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm so fucking over obsessive compulsive about stand-up [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1989.24s)]
*  that like as soon as I knew I had the shoot date, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=1995.64s)]
*  I mean I pick out my date based on when I set my tour. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2000.2s)]
*  So I wanted to be a place I've never performed that material. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2003.32s)]
*  I wanted to know a place I can move at least 12,000 tickets [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2006.44s)]
*  because I want to do a bunch of shows. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2009.32s)]
*  And I mean two months out on that bus I'm doing stand-up every single night. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2012.1200000000001s)]
*  Every single night as many times I get on stage [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2016.52s)]
*  and I'm moving the material around, I wanted to be perfect. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2019.16s)]
*  I could never do what Chris Rock did with the live shit. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2022.04s)]
*  I would be fucking dead in the water. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2024.2s)]
*  The live one's an interesting choice because Louis did a similar thing. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2025.88s)]
*  Louis did it live on his website and then he's going to release [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2029.24s)]
*  a full edited version of the set. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2032.52s)]
*  And then I guess that's exactly what Chris is doing. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2036.04s)]
*  He released it in the full edited. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2038.68s)]
*  The shit about Will Smith was ruthless. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2040.36s)]
*  It's just like imagine, you know in life you play chess. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2047.32s)]
*  You move pieces around. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2052.52s)]
*  You say I do this and the counter would be that. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2053.64s)]
*  And like imagine the thought like I'm just going to slap Chris Rock, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2056.7599999999998s)]
*  one of the greatest stand-up comedians of all time. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2062.92s)]
*  It's not like he's going to tear my very vulnerable life apart [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2064.8399999999997s)]
*  after I smack him with some of the best comedy that anybody's ever written. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2069.16s)]
*  And he's going to hone it over a year before he releases it. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2074.44s)]
*  What a terrible, unprovoked attack. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2080.04s)]
*  What a dumb thing to do. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2085.24s)]
*  To be that person who's publicly loved like Will Smith was until that moment. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2087.96s)]
*  I mean until that moment nobody really had a bad thing to say about. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2096.2s)]
*  Maybe he didn't like one movie or maybe he thought the superhero movie was dumb. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2100.44s)]
*  But everybody loved that guy. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2104.3599999999997s)]
*  I loved the superhero. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2105.48s)]
*  I loved Will. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2106.52s)]
*  I love Will. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2107.3199999999997s)]
*  I still love Will. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2107.88s)]
*  But those two keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2108.68s)]
*  Those two are what sunk him. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2113.48s)]
*  If he just slapped Chris Rock and then sat down and didn't say anything. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2115.48s)]
*  People would think it was a joke. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2119.96s)]
*  They wouldn't know what to do. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2121.24s)]
*  It would kind of drift off and people would forget about it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2123.2400000000002s)]
*  And they would say to Chris, was that on purpose? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2126.92s)]
*  Did you guys plan that? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2128.44s)]
*  Then he would have skated. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2130.36s)]
*  I'm not happy that it happened but I'm happy the way it happened. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2134.36s)]
*  Because when I was trying to explain to someone who's not involved in show business [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2138.28s)]
*  how bizarre the industry is and how untethered those people are to either morals or ethics or [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2144.12s)]
*  just the reality of human nature. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2156.04s)]
*  They are completely connected to the zeitgeist in terms of what's popular and what's trendy [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2159.16s)]
*  and what's accepted by our group and what's rejected by our group. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2167.3199999999997s)]
*  That no one has, I mean not no one, but in general the mindset of the people in Hollywood. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2171.88s)]
*  There's very little independent thought. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2179.96s)]
*  It's all group think. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2182.36s)]
*  So when Will Smith after smacking Chris Rock and all that other craziness [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2184.04s)]
*  goes on stage and wins the Academy Award and gets a fucking standing ovation. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2189.88s)]
*  That was like that's those people. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2196.12s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2199.7200000000003s)]
*  They don't have the ability to say hey that's not right. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2201.8s)]
*  I don't care if you're famous. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2206.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't care if you just won the Oscar. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2208.28s)]
*  You can't assault people. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2210.04s)]
*  What you did is ridiculous. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2211.5600000000004s)]
*  The way you're behaving is crazy. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2213.0s)]
*  It didn't even make sense. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2215.0800000000004s)]
*  It wasn't even proportionate to what he said. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2216.6000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't like you overreacted in such a strange way. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2219.6400000000003s)]
*  I have to wonder are you okay? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2223.1600000000003s)]
*  Like what the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2224.52s)]
*  No one did that. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2226.52s)]
*  They all like yes it was amazing. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2227.2400000000002s)]
*  They went to the Vanity Fair party. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2229.7200000000003s)]
*  He was dancing. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2231.16s)]
*  It was almost like it all went away until the rest of the world is like [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2232.12s)]
*  are you out of your fucking mind? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2235.24s)]
*  What is wrong with you? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2237.7999999999997s)]
*  That is crazy that it did not get acknowledged at all. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2238.92s)]
*  Do you think that's a testament to the internet? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2244.68s)]
*  Because the internet was like what the fuck? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2246.2s)]
*  Yes it definitely is a testament to the internet. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2247.96s)]
*  But the internet is just representative of most people. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2250.44s)]
*  There's some people that thought that Chris deserved it. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2253.24s)]
*  You know don't talk about someone's wife. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2255.72s)]
*  Like there's a lot of goofy people out there. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2257.16s)]
*  I had to set up. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2258.7599999999998s)]
*  You've made me start a new fucking twitter account because of something. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2259.8s)]
*  I've been off twitter for like a year and I had to because you sent me something about [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2263.32s)]
*  Jordan Peterson. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2267.1600000000003s)]
*  That Chinese dick sucking factory. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2268.2000000000003s)]
*  And I had to sign up for a new twitter account. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2269.8s)]
*  Do we know if that's real? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2272.36s)]
*  I thought it was beeple. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2273.2400000000002s)]
*  I looked at it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2274.44s)]
*  Did they delete it off of Instagram or off of Twitter? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2275.7200000000003s)]
*  So Jordan tweets this thing and these guys are lying on hospital beds in some lab somewhere [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2280.1200000000003s)]
*  with like a robot sucking their dick and they have like covid masks on. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2288.04s)]
*  They're just lying on their back with their pants off. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2291.4s)]
*  And so I sent it to these guys. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2293.72s)]
*  Did Jordan Peterson actually tweeted it? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2296.12s)]
*  I might even have to check in on Jordan. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2298.44s)]
*  That was a good podcast with you and Jordan recently. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2299.8s)]
*  Oh my god the last one he was on fire. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2301.8s)]
*  He was on fire. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2303.72s)]
*  He was on fire. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2304.44s)]
*  Don't have that brain. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2304.92s)]

*  We talk. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2351.56s)]

*  This says it's from the UK. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2355.64s)]
*  It says it's a fetish house or something. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2356.68s)]
*  Oh it's from the UK. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2358.68s)]
*  But didn't it have Chinese writing in something? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2360.52s)]
*  There is other stuff online that's trying to say this is from China. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2362.92s)]
*  Oh okay. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2365.96s)]

*  The internet can fucking deliver. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2385.6400000000003s)]
*  Put that meme after that video. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2389.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2393.7200000000003s)]
*  So it's a UK fetish house. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2394.36s)]
*  So it's a real video. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2396.84s)]
*  It says I found this on WeChat. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2398.1200000000003s)]
*  They said this is China's collection room for sperm bank. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2400.52s)]
*  That's a weird statement too. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2404.44s)]
*  That's what it says from WeChat? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2405.48s)]
*  That's what the person that found it on WeChat says this is probably what the caption on the video was. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2406.92s)]
*  Oh okay. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2411.48s)]
*  But how does it relate to the UK then? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2412.36s)]
*  It turns out the video is from the UK. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2415.32s)]
*  Oh so it's not really... [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2417.0s)]
*  It's a fetish house. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2418.04s)]
*  You imagine trusting a robot on your dick? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2420.04s)]
*  Like what if it breaks? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2422.68s)]
*  What if it goes wrong? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2423.96s)]
*  I've done it. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2424.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2425.56s)]
*  With that? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2426.12s)]
*  No not that thing but I've had the... [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2426.7599999999998s)]
*  That thing looks too strong. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2428.6s)]
*  Tom and I got a bunch of sex toys for two bears to try them out. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2430.68s)]
*  The only ones we tried out were the anal... [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2435.08s)]
*  We did butt plugs. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2436.92s)]
*  Put them in your own butt? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2438.92s)]
*  We tried. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2439.96s)]
*  It's really hard to get a butt plug in your ass. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2440.44s)]
*  You'd be shocked. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2442.52s)]
*  I think... [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2444.7599999999998s)]
*  Some gals would beg to differ. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2445.56s)]
*  Dude I don't know how they do it. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2447.56s)]
*  I think you gotta have someone put a butt plug in your ass because I don't think you... [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2448.84s)]
*  Could do it yourself? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2452.04s)]
*  It's too hard. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2453.0s)]
*  Both of us tried pretty aggressively. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2453.96s)]
*  But one of the things we got... [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2456.68s)]
*  One of the things we got was a blowjob machine. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2458.28s)]
*  It's like an electronic blowjob machine. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2461.8s)]
*  Somebody mentioned that on the podcast once, right? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2464.04s)]
*  Didn't they send us some? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2466.44s)]
*  And we were like get the fuck out of here with this thing. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2468.36s)]
*  We have something out there. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2470.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2471.7200000000003s)]
*  You wanna try it? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2472.2200000000003s)]
*  No we don't wanna try it. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2473.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean bring it in. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2473.96s)]
*  Let's see what this is. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2474.84s)]
*  Just let it hang out and get to know us. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2475.6400000000003s)]
*  That thing where the cord's hanging from the ceiling... [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2478.84s)]
*  I couldn't have my hands tied up and have something on my dick. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2481.6400000000003s)]
*  I guess here's the tweet that Jordan made. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2484.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2486.04s)]
*  He called it, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2487.34s)]
*  So much fun and unbelievable techno nightmare CCP hell. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2488.3s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2493.1s)]
*  What is he saying? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2495.1s)]
*  They're all shaved. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2495.82s)]
*  But what does he say in about... [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2497.18s)]
*  He posted something about that in the last... [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2498.62s)]
*  What you just had. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2500.86s)]
*  This is somebody else talking about it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2501.66s)]

*  I don't think I... [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2523.66s)]
*  I know that I did. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2524.38s)]

*  Yeah don't welcome that in your life. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2535.02s)]
*  There's other shit to do. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2536.86s)]
*  You should be on your tour bus. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2537.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2539.02s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2561.82s)]
*  The latex thing is a weird one right? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2562.78s)]
*  Like there's something about like the leather and the zippers and the bondage and the straps. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2564.2200000000003s)]
*  Like what is that? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2570.2200000000003s)]

*  That I can't understand. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2575.2599999999998s)]
*  They pay for it. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2580.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not enjoyable. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2581.98s)]
*  They're tied behind their back with a fucking ball in their mouth getting kicked in the nuts. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2582.8599999999997s)]

*  They like that shit. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2590.8599999999997s)]
*  That's it right? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2591.74s)]
*  Yeah they're CEOs. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2592.62s)]
*  Did I ever tell you the time when Norton and I were having dinner after a show [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2593.66s)]
*  and we're in Austin and some lady comes up to him [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2597.3399999999997s)]
*  because she knows he's into BDSM. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2601.1s)]
*  So he's into dominatrices and she comes over and tells us that she's a dominatrix. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2603.8199999999997s)]
*  And we're like no way. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2609.2599999999998s)]
*  So she sits down with us and tells us the story [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2610.94s)]
*  because she knows that Norton's into it and tells us it's like mostly these very [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2614.46s)]
*  wealthy business owners and CEOs and these like button down guys [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2621.42s)]
*  and then they what they really want to do to blow that steam off is just be really naughty. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2627.02s)]
*  They want to be naughty boys. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2633.1s)]
*  They want to be told what to do and the girl dominates them. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2634.38s)]
*  And she goes it's not even really sexual. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2638.3s)]
*  Like a lot of times like sometimes they jerk off but a lot of times they don't even. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2640.46s)]
*  It's like not sexual at all. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2644.94s)]
*  It's like they just want a woman to tell them what to do while they're naked [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2646.38s)]
*  and yell at them and make fun of them and mock them. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2650.54s)]
*  I once I came I'd be like all right the game's over. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2653.3399999999997s)]

*  I got to get an uber out of here. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2659.74s)]
*  I'm embarrassed of who I am. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2661.1s)]
*  When I did it they did everything to me. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2662.38s)]
*  The electric shocked my balls. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2664.46s)]
*  They put 10 pound weights on my balls like they put a like a cock ring ball thing [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2666.2999999999997s)]
*  and then then hold them down. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2670.7799999999997s)]
*  10 pounds is fucking heavy. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2672.06s)]
*  I think it was 10 pounds. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2673.42s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2674.46s)]
*  I was tied up. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2674.86s)]
*  I was tied up totally fucking naked. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2675.5s)]

*  Totally fucking naked. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2678.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean completely naked. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2680.62s)]
*  I think they shaved me and I was like at one point I was like am I shooting a porn? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2682.22s)]
*  This feels like we're shooting porn and never got hard until they put me in this thing like latex. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2686.7s)]
*  She wrapped me in it and she slid a tube in it and she squirted some sort of lube into the tube [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2697.1s)]
*  and started moving it around inside the latex and I was bound. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=2704.22s)]

*  like it's got to be a little more structured you'll see but it needs to be a little more [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3244.06s)]
*  structured and I didn't understand him he's talking about and I realized it can be fun it [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3247.42s)]

*  now I'm 50 and like and like I can really appreciate that like I can really appreciate it I would it [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3562.8599999999997s)]

*  to me like I'm so like when I did the Boston Garden I fucking I cried on stage well I'm gonna cry telling [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3573.66s)]
*  you this but it's standing ovations are interesting because you can cheat them I did this to Ari one [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3581.1s)]
*  time I was like I go you want me to show you how to get standing ovation and he was like wait you [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3588.7s)]

*  powerpoint process of how to get a standing ovation and he was I mean Joe it was almost like the day [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3596.7799999999997s)]
*  he lost his religion in Judaism he just like that's not fair [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3603.1s)]
*  is anyone else upset by this but when you get them and you've earned them and then and it happens [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3610.38s)]
*  quick and it's just and everyone stands up that has happened a few times to me and every time I [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3615.58s)]
*  fucking cry I'm just like boom water I cry easy too I think I'm fucking I think I'm on testosterone [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3621.8199999999997s)]

*  call you they but yeah like those I never thought I'd I never thought I'd be where I am and if it [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3633.5s)]
*  and if it all goes away tomorrow I go that was a fun fucking ride it's like riding a horse it's [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3641.34s)]
*  fucking been a goddamn trip but the key is now with the success you have is recognizing that [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3645.18s)]
*  there is no destination that is known because this thought that you're gonna get somewhere and [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3651.5s)]
*  it's all gonna make sense no what happens is your motivation shifts your motivation shifts from [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3657.42s)]
*  this undesirable this this unstoppable desire to make it then your motivation should shift to [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3663.98s)]
*  doing the best work that you can that was my last night last I'm I don't get a nervous going on stage [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3671.42s)]
*  but very suddenly do I prepare like prepare where I go let's think very thoughtfully about what we [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3678.94s)]
*  want to let's let's turn this into a job and let's work and last night I sat down before dinner with [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3684.94s)]
*  you and I wrote every new idea I had down and I said I got my book I'm gonna I remember a lot [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3690.38s)]
*  of them I want to do I'm gonna make sure I hit all of them because I was like there's a chance that [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3696.94s)]
*  like Jim Norton I didn't know Jim would be there but like there's a chance that I know that you'll [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3701.98s)]
*  be there and I go these are my peers and I want to make sure they know that I'm working does that [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3706.06s)]
*  make sense the second you see your peers stop working and I won't say their names but we've [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3709.7400000000002s)]
*  seen them yeah the big comics that just phone it in and yeah and and and I go and I was very [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3713.82s)]
*  thoughtful in my approach to doing stand-up last night because I was like I was like I was like [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3719.1800000000003s)]
*  that's that's when it goes away is when you just when you stop giving a fuck you stop bringing [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3724.7000000000003s)]
*  around that's with everything in life that's when your marriage fucks up that's when your [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3728.46s)]
*  friendships fuck up that's when you're a bad neighbor that's when you're a bad dad that's when [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3732.7000000000003s)]
*  you're bad at your job it's it's when you suck at a sport you know I mean a lot of things in life [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3737.74s)]
*  is whether or not you appreciate them it's being in them and recognizing like when we were kids [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3745.8199999999997s)]
*  when we were starting out doing stand-up the idea that making a living doing stand-up was crazy [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3751.2599999999998s)]
*  like we always had jobs right everybody had jobs in the beginning so you're like imagine if I could [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3756.22s)]

*  got to be healthy and don't just think about it when you get sick because when you're healthy you [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3807.98s)]
*  think about all kinds of stupid shit you don't think about make sure you don't get sick but when [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=3813.26s)]

*  it's literally how the bible got written the bible got written it's based on oral stories [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=5635.66s)]
*  that lasted for probably a thousand years [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=5641.18s)]
*  did you hear my video about that last night about the bible i thought they wrote it in rocks [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=5646.0599999999995s)]

*  that shit but that's the original bible unless you get to the dead sea scrolls which is aramaic [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=5672.3s)]
*  so like if you're reading the bible you would have to understand ancient hebrew and ancient hebrew [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=5678.54s)]
*  is a completely different kind of language because the letters are also numeric so like the letter a [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=5683.1s)]

*  so like when you say something it has a numeric value i can't wait to retell this story to dinner [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=5695.26s)]

*  out of a university in england where they're doing a slow drip dmt experience with these people [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8095.740000000001s)]
*  and because they're doing it for hours and hours they do a slow drip where they're they keep them [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8104.22s)]
*  in this state which is normally a very transient state because you hit it with a fucking pipe [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8109.820000000001s)]
*  yeah normally yeah yeah so there's no regulating how much you get right so this because it's an [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8115.1s)]
*  ivy because it's coming in a drip it's like constant and continuous and these people are [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8120.06s)]
*  going to the same place and they're having repeatable experiences so instead of having [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8125.580000000001s)]
*  like a 15 minute dmt trip which is a lot of people have that's like overwhelming you can't [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8130.3s)]
*  even figure out what's going on then it's over instead of that you're going to the exact same [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8134.06s)]
*  place over and over and over again and getting more and more comfortable with it and coming back [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8138.780000000001s)]
*  with very similar stories so yeah it's a repeatable environment where they're [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8143.18s)]
*  encountering entities and they're trying to map it so these people are doing these long-term studies [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8149.42s)]
*  with long-term experiments meaning like not a 15 minute term but like not a 15 minute trip but [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8155.740000000001s)]
*  multiple hours at a time and they're coming back with like a map of the territory so the [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8162.9400000000005s)]
*  this is the concept the theory that many people have is that death opens up a chemical gateway [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8170.3s)]
*  in the mind and that chemical gateway takes whatever the soul is whatever consciousness is [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8177.1s)]
*  and transports it into this new realm it allows you your conscious mind to access this new realm [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8183.66s)]
*  which is available to you upon death and so a lot of the ancient cultures that did ayahuasca [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8191.1s)]
*  and all and and mushrooms they would talk about this realm as being like a well of souls [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8197.66s)]
*  that you encountered disembodied life forms disembodied spirits and this has been it's been [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8205.9s)]
*  a staple of so many religions there's so many religions that talk about the afterlife i mean [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8215.74s)]
*  i get that you would want to come up with something like that just because you wanted to [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8221.58s)]
*  have some sort of a reason to keep going with the rational mind when you're dealing with this [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8226.46s)]
*  existential angst of a temporary existence and one day you're just going to be worm food what's the [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8232.46s)]
*  point of it all why don't i end it now it's too much life is to live is to suffer no there's [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8236.86s)]
*  something waiting for you when it's over and this is like that's the carrot at the end of the stick [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8242.54s)]
*  so a lot of people think well i'm too smart for that fucking carrot like no no no no life is [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8247.1s)]
*  suffering like is pointless and it goes black one day it's like what bourdain did to himself [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8251.98s)]
*  it's like there's like this romantic notion that some people have that to end this depressing [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8256.859999999999s)]
*  thinking is like to just do it just to end your own life is the best way to just get through this [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8262.38s)]
*  but they don't know they don't know like you don't know that you just go black you have no idea [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8268.779999999999s)]
*  they don't just say that is so foolish just to think of the fucking complexity of the universe [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8275.66s)]
*  itself just the the vast scope of it and now with this james webb telescope they're starting to like [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8282.06s)]
*  look at galaxies that don't even make sense like how is this galaxy so formed and it's so far away [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8288.22s)]
*  like is the is the universe older than we think it is like there's all this new speculation now [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8293.66s)]
*  because of new data to think that you know what happens to you when you die is dumb it's dumb you [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8299.1s)]
*  don't you cannot know this i thought this was getting a panic attack now i'm feeling better [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=8306.220000000001s)]

*  had covid i fucking worked out and been like push it in the gym while you had covid yeah wow [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9149.58s)]
*  sometimes that's not wise i'm sure this idea that you're supposed to sweat it out that's horseshit [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9155.9s)]
*  tell that to cam haines cam haines was the one he got sick i had to send a doctor to him he ran i [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9161.18s)]

*  yeah while he had covid that's a that's a motherfucker right it's not yeah don't do that [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9170.38s)]
*  can i tell you why i like cam haines okay his book that he wrote did you listen to it am i of [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9174.94s)]
*  course am i being drunk i'm in it his book i wrote i did the forward to it his book is a self it's a [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9182.619999999999s)]
*  it's a self-help book it's a motivational book but it's based on his own life experiences yeah so [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9189.02s)]
*  you can tether yourself to his life experiences and go and i'm similar to that that's what i [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9194.54s)]
*  liked about that book this shit with his dad and his running stuff is i can understand that [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9200.220000000001s)]
*  and and it was so cool i listened to one on the beach on a jog and uh and i like i like self-help [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9206.300000000001s)]
*  books like that you know where they're like they tell you about their life and their struggles and [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9212.140000000001s)]
*  they're not trying to pinpoint your weaknesses they're letting you know about their weaknesses [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9217.1s)]
*  i love that shit man the reason why i bring up you shouldn't work out while you're sick [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9221.1s)]
*  is because even for elite athletes when they work out when they get sick they just get sicker [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9225.02s)]
*  and that's what happened with hamzat shemayev hamzat shemayev is one of the best fighters in [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9230.86s)]
*  the ufc he got covid and kept training and got really fucking sick for real and was hospitalized [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9235.42s)]
*  not just once but multiple times hospitalized with covid because he wouldn't stop training [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9243.58s)]
*  because he was a fucking animal so he'd get a little bit better and then he'd break his [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9249.66s)]
*  body down again like covid is a very strange disease and if you let it get deep into your [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9253.98s)]
*  body like if you break yourself down like it's it seems to have affected i know quite a few people [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9263.02s)]
*  they got it really bad when they were drinking like they were really drunk and depleted and their [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9267.98s)]
*  immune system was crashed which is oftentimes how people get sick and then they got it really bad [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9272.78s)]
*  but the people that worked out while they had it man they kept it for a long fucking time [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9277.34s)]
*  and hamzat posted a photograph of his toilet whereas like blood splattered in the toilet [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9281.82s)]
*  because he was throwing up blood and and he was saying like he's gonna have to retire from [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9287.98s)]
*  fighting because his lungs were fucked up from covid so lianne had long covid and she got when [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9292.380000000001s)]
*  the first time she got covid i think she had covid a couple times now the first time she got it she [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9299.42s)]
*  worked out the whole time she had it yeah that's probably what gave her long covid and it probably [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9303.82s)]
*  broke her body down it's like your body never has a chance to fully recover you got to let your body [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9308.22s)]
*  get to a hundred percent you got to let you like your body's struggling right and when you are [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9313.26s)]
*  exercising what you're doing is you're taxing your body's resources so your body has to repair [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9318.86s)]
*  and improve and it repairs your cardiovascular system and your muscular system you get stronger [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9326.06s)]
*  and you get healthier but it's all about breaking down and rebuilding well when you're sick you [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9331.74s)]
*  don't rebuild you just break down further so you're breaking down a system that's already taxed [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9336.78s)]
*  you already feel like shit you're like oh i just need to push myself in the gym no you need to [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9342.539999999999s)]
*  fucking rest you need a fucking rest if you don't do that it'll just get deep into your system so [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9346.06s)]
*  then so i'm curious about your your actual motivations so when you get up this morning [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9353.1s)]
*  do you you don't have a personal trainer right you don't have anyone that sets up a training [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9359.42s)]
*  program for you no i don't have so then do you go today is shoulders and you do shoulders yeah [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9362.54s)]
*  write things out i have a whiteboard and i write out all the different workouts so you make up your [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9368.62s)]
*  own workout yeah and i have like a um i have circuits that i do so i have circuits that i [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9373.02s)]
*  repeat and then i either add weight or add repetitions or i'll add additional exercise [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9379.5s)]
*  when i decide the circuit's too easy can you post those on instagram from now on i'd be curious to [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9385.58s)]
*  see those i don't i try not to make it too public because i think part of what i like to do is i [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9390.54s)]
*  like to do it by myself um i don't want to be there's a i mean i've done it before like i've [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9396.060000000001s)]
*  talked about what i've done before but i think there's something that's good about just doing it [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9402.060000000001s)]
*  in silence doing it by yourself it's just struggling don't tell the whole world that you're doing this [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9406.78s)]
*  i kind of do already that's all i do i know but for my head it's better to not [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9412.46s)]
*  really yeah yeah yeah for my head it's better to just go through it just go through it and [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9417.099999999999s)]
*  because everything i do is so public already anyway like it's better to not have that and [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9422.38s)]
*  which is like my medicine like that's my medicine and working out as my medicine that's my mental [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9427.019999999999s)]
*  medicine for sure but you understand the value in knowing your medicine as an outsider i'm not [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9432.22s)]
*  advocating that you should post these for real because if that's how it works for you it should [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9439.18s)]
*  work but i am curious is like uh i've done we like when we did the hundred push-ups a perfect example [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9442.7s)]
*  knowing knowing that that's the benchmark uh that it's interesting to see how you like how hard you [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9450.300000000001s)]
*  actually are pushing it because if i wrote my own workouts they'd be fucking keg walks yeah they'd [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9458.62s)]
*  be fucking keg walks i have someone else lacy mackie does all my she's my trainer she travels [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=9463.34s)]

*  rifle bullets are the hardest thing to get in an apocalypse okay maybe because they don't make that [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11727.58s)]
*  many of them but you don't want a 22 like you want to like a you want a more versatile round [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11732.46s)]
*  you know and the one thing that can kill everything yeah you want something to kill a [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11740.78s)]
*  moose and a deer and a fucking groundhog like whatever the fuck you want to shoot but you can't [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11744.7s)]
*  kill a groundhog with the same thing you kill moose with you'll certainly can no for real certainly [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11748.86s)]
*  can yeah your head shot them when their heads explode boom yeah there's a video of brock lesnar [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11753.02s)]

*  gunpowder yeah it's not good you don't need that you don't want to hunt squirrels with a 50 caliber [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11803.02s)]
*  but like a 300 wind mag is like a good versatile round you can shoot deer with it you can shoot a [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11810.460000000001s)]

*  you don't want just 22s because if you shoot a deer with a 22 you're probably going to wound it [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11822.140000000001s)]
*  it's probably going to run away and you're probably never going to find it it might run [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VykPavc_NP4&t=11827.02s)]
