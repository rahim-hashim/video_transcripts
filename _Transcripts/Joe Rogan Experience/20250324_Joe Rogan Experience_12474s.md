# JRE Fight Companion - March 22, 2025
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI)
*  I told you about the hey, we're up. We're up. We're up. We're up [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not a good sign that the fights are still going on for the prelims [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4.2s)]
*  That must mean there's a lot of decisions a lot of pretty loose a lot of prelims [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8.76s)]
*  But also a lot of decisions like usually they time it out better because it's like 304 now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12.6s)]
*  And this is 137 to go in the third round of Jai Herbert not ideal no, but you know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=16.78s)]
*  Shit happens should listen at least they're not doing it at 5 o'clock in the morning true [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=23.88s)]
*  That was that was fucking ridiculous if I was Leon I'd be pissed what time was it in the UK when it's normal time [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=27.8s)]
*  It's uh, you know seven hours ahead. Yeah, so it's nighttime there. Yeah, so it's like 10 p.m. Right now. It's normal [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=34.36s)]
*  Are they six hours ahead or seven hours? I thought it was seven something like that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=40.52s)]
*  But either way it's nighttime there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=44.88s)]
*  So have you seen any of these guys yeah, Jai Herbert's the guy that head kicked Ilya toporia he dropped him out [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=48.08s)]
*  He dropped no vicious head game, then Ilya fucking star him in the next round. He has great striking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=53.78s)]
*  Yeah, very very good kicks big prospect real tall long lanky, dude, but you know Ilya that guy he connects on anybody [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=59.78s)]
*  They're going night night. Oh Joe you if you knew I know you can't probably talk about it [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=67.66s)]
*  But you see Ilya's tweet where he's like I'm a big news you guys aren't expecting it. Yeah, I don't know the news [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=71.66s)]
*  You have no clue. No, I don't know if I had a guess he's probably fighting a top contender at 55 [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  But that wouldn't be unexpected you know I'm saying he's like you won't see this coming [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=82.61999999999999s)]
*  So it's not Mark chef because we all assume that much is not finding much just going to 70 a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=85.7s)]
*  Bill is walking around at 186. He's big Connor [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=92.14s)]
*  That's crazy Connor had to have to be in the testing pool for a long time [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=96.5s)]
*  Isn't he doing bare knuckle Connor? Well, he's running bare knuckle. He's like one of the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=101.02s)]
*  Fucking a fight. No, he may might get a fucking margin powder [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=106.82s)]
*  Fuckin dude [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=112.66s)]
*  He's also running for fucking fight bad knuckle. He might he might I mean I could see him [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  I would blow bear knuckle right. Oh, yeah, I mean they'd have to pay [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=119.42s)]
*  Him first Jeremy Stevens, oh my goodness Jeremy would have to win a couple more times, but Jeremy's back in the UFC [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=125.58s)]
*  No, no Jeremy's undefeated and Bellamata doors been my always changes his nickname, but let's get a new identity [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=131.28s)]
*  Well, we announce it you won't believe it get ready see when you say you won't believe it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=136.86s)]
*  You gotta come with some shit now. Yeah, you got it, but that was a while ago. That's March 6th, you know [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=140.38s)]
*  What is today? There's 22nd, but that's the UFC being like don't announce yet. Yeah, I don't know, you know [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=144.98s)]
*  I don't know like if I a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  Perfect matchup is Gagey. I think Charles Olivera. Oh, that's a that's a motherfucker. That's a great matchup [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=153.54s)]
*  Yes, a great and now remember he tweeted that before Gagey's fight. I don't think it's a cut. Oh, right [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=159.84s)]
*  Oh [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=166.16s)]
*  Horrible place to oh boy, but this is the last round. I think the fight the fights over might be over. Yeah. Yeah [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  Dustin Poirier [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=175.48s)]
*  No, Dustin's fighting Max. He is I think so for the BMF shit. Really? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=177.18s)]
*  I think double check that's a great fight too. I'm crazy the third go-around [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=182.38s)]
*  At 55 and it's max proper. See I think max should fight more at 55. I don't like [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=187.56s)]
*  I think it's too much of a struggle. He got pretty big when he got up to fight Gagey. He put the weight on right fantastic [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=193.72s)]
*  I think that we all remember the knockout of Gagey the last seconds there, but he was mollywap in him before that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=199.52s)]
*  He was beating his ass and it all started off with that jump-spinning back kick to the face in the first round fucked up [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=205.22s)]
*  Gagey's already fixed nose. So that max hallway the true max. Oh at 55 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=209.8s)]
*  I was fucking Dustin for Dustin's last fight in New Orleans [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=213.94s)]
*  Sure [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=218.02s)]
*  The thing is you got to wonder like how much did that Ilya Toporya knockout take out of max true cuz that was a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=218.8s)]
*  Beating true. Ilya is just so fucking dangerous. He's so technical like his striking though. He's like bobbing in and moving [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=224.48s)]
*  He's so comfortable with his head movement. He sees like a step ahead of everybody. He's good at everything and then people like oh [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=232.12s)]
*  He's too small for 55. Like he's actually that that narrative don't work. He's a big fucking boy [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=237.96s)]
*  Well, I think the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=243.0s)]
*  45 pound cut is look man. They should all stop cutting weight. That's the reality cutting weight is bullshit [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  It's terrible for you. They need more weight classes and they need to stop cutting weight [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=250.2s)]
*  They need to figure out a way to check hydration levels and put people in a weight class and say this is still do that in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=254.44s)]
*  one [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  No, what one's backed off MMA like they have a big Muay Thai fight tonight. They backed off [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they're really focused on kickboxing Muay Thai I think in Asia that gets a lot of numbers big time and they put on [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=268.44s)]
*  Fucking shows man. Yeah, there's a huge one tonight huge one kickboxing and Muay Thai fights [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  I think the UFC fucked up when they went with slap fighting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=280.24s)]
*  I've been telling them forever you guys should get into kickboxing if you only like stand-up fights [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=283.88s)]
*  There's it's not like the old days of kickboxing where they're boring like no karate [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=289.52s)]
*  There's characters man and the knockouts are fucking crazy also all your champs are coming from kickboxing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Alex is he I get some monsters kickboxing with MMA gloves in a cage would be giant [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=300.16s)]
*  Just have a striking only segment of the UFC and glory's coming back. Glory's doing a heavyweight competition soon [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=307.76s)]
*  Glory's got some elite fighters, man. I watch Gloria all the time. It's fucking exciting, but nobody's watching it [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  Nobody knows who these people are just got to educate the crowd put the same amount of resources in the slap fight [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=320.52s)]
*  Right in the kickboxing is you're cooking right and then they're doing it with Jitsu, right, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=326.2s)]
*  They're doing they put how many millions dollars in Jitsu and they even have more of a budget for it [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah, a lot of it's Eddie, you know, they put a lot of it in the Jitsu. Yeah, Mikey [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=336.68s)]
*  Yeah, it is with the fight. No with you see five [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm saying as far as making it popular like you have five all that shit like that's you were the one, you know [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=345.72s)]
*  I know we're boys, but you were really the one to navigate all that with fight paths. That was huge [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=351.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was a big deal having the UFC get involved heavily and you just it was huge [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=355.12s)]
*  Are you still doing stuff with them? Yeah. Yeah, I have a great relationship with them [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=359.68s)]
*  I think they're trying to put together some kind of like a tough show now like an ultimate fighter show for grappling [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  Which would be which would be cool because then you can like build a star from scratch [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=369.86s)]
*  And get to know the guys exactly yeah, you can get people emotionally involved because they because they they exclusively signed Mikey Moushameshi, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=374.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to get people to watch those reality shows these days [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=381.64000000000004s)]
*  I think people kind of burned out on reality shows, you know DC and jailers shooting one right now [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  They're shooting the ultimate fight. They gotta give up on that bro. And listen, what's that 90? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=389.0s)]
*  I don't know where you watch it. It's on ESPN plus. Is it I haven't watched it in forever. No, I watched the finals [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=393.04s)]
*  I watched the finals to see how good guys are sure and you know and see where they're at, you know [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=400.8s)]
*  I watched Dana White's contender series probably more that's the best thing in combat sports far as like talent like [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=405.40000000000003s)]
*  It's the best because they're super hyped. They have insane motivation [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=411.68s)]
*  They have this unbelievable opportunity if they do that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=415.92s)]
*  They get skyrocketed into the end [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=418.52s)]
*  It's not like ultimate fighter like where you can win based off grappling and you know and just hold guys down they become champion [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=420.16s)]
*  You see contract could Dana White contender series there's due to win and he's like nah not excited enough [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=425.44s)]
*  So dudes go for broke. Yeah sugar Sean came from there [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=430.92s)]
*  I mean, there's so many champs a lot of people came from our tomorrow [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=434.88s)]
*  Is it illegal to have a finish bonus in the UFC like you get paid whatever? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=437.36s)]
*  80,000 to show 80,000 a win and then another 80,000 if you finish the fight [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=444.52s)]
*  Legal no, no, no, definitely not illegal. No, they do it now. I would performance bonus [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=451.2s)]
*  Yeah a little bit or or go gangster and go, you know [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=456.64s)]
*  You have show money and then you get extra money like, you know double but you have to knock them out or submit [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=460.88s)]
*  See you just get your show money. UfL does that I don't want to say it the ufL does that really? Yeah [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=466.8s)]
*  Okay, I think that's a good idea. What's ufL now. What do you mean pfl? No ufL? What's ufL? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=471.74s)]
*  UfLs were like Tony Ferguson Dillon dances fighting. I thought there was GFL [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=478.56s)]
*  Yeah, GFL. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah GFL. Sorry. Yeah, there's pfl. There's GFL ufL something else [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=482.8s)]
*  But we're talking about the one fight that I'm interested. Yo, Romero and Musasi. That's a great fight. That's a great fight [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=488.76s)]
*  That's fine one fight that GFL is putting together my oh, I was that are they both over 40. They're a hundred years old [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=494.12s)]
*  Yeah, you're both a hundred else 79 years old [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=500.48s)]
*  I don't care. He looked fucking amazing. Well, he's finding bare-knuckle. Yeah, too [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  Like you saw some promo some giant duties fighting. Do you see him box that slap fight guy, bro? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=508.88s)]
*  That's slap fight guy when he jumped up there was like, oh I fucked up [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=514.48s)]
*  Right before he decided to beat his ass he just jumped straight up in the air [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=522.2s)]
*  It's just some sloppy white guy seemed to step forward [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=525.8s)]
*  If the UFC does kickboxing they might as well just come out with a bang and go bare-knuckle kickboxing [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  Take my money and that'll that'll you know that'll get people to check it out [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=538.16s)]
*  Do it separate from UFC events or would you do it like would do it like one or you have like MMA fights and kickboxing? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=543.0799999999999s)]
*  Mix it up. I think you could do whatever you wanted, but you could definitely could have a stand-up only show and it would be huge [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=549.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, where they break them up if they clinch against the cage, you know [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=554.84s)]
*  You don't allow them to clinch do it just like kickboxing does separate them, you know, like there's no ground fight [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=558.52s)]
*  Backwards the truth like really you think we had kickboxing no one watched it [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=564.08s)]
*  We already had it know but when the UFC came out people all of a sudden people are into martial arts again [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  And if we go that's going back, I think I don't know I see what you're saying [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=575.4s)]
*  But look the UFC does grappling events, right? The grappling events are pure grappling [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=579.2s)]
*  Why not do pure striking events to and well MMA is always well [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, it was when the UFC blew up it was UFC to correct. Yeah, nobody watched UFC one [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  They didn't know if it was real that there was no b-roll right everyone watched UFC to and [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=592.48s)]
*  Did they get blown away and get hooked by it because of the striking or because of the jujitsu? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, it was because it was hoist. It was the jujitsu. Yeah people didn't realize that you could fight on the ground [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=604.44s)]
*  I thought fighting on the grounds was for puts but then I went mainstream for a tough one with stand-up with Stefan and force [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=609.96s)]
*  but listen, let's imagine that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=616.28s)]
*  That [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=618.48s)]
*  Ankolyev and Pereira fight an only kickboxing fight. Are you telling me that's gonna be boring? That'd be that's going insane [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=619.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they're watching with little gloves [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=627.6s)]
*  Oh with MMA gloves if they're gonna do it I'd go bare-knuckle if it was up to me because the thing about bare-knuckle those your face [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  Gets obliterated. Yes the slices that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  Want to see the hands break people want to see I [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=639.16s)]
*  Commodate for game bread where it's bare-knuckle MMA and seen JDS and Alan Belcher and Roy [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=643.72s)]
*  They don't punch the same right the little cautious because they don't want to break. It's more real. It's not it's more real [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=649.9200000000001s)]

*  To cut him because they kept giving these young lines. He kept beating him. Yeah [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=703.24s)]
*  He can't do just get out of here. He's like nah, he's such a veteran. He's so savvy. He sees everything coming [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=706.8000000000001s)]

*  Yeah, I mean how bad were they? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=729.72s)]
*  They get worse. Yeah, did they get worse injury? It's a bad injury because it's such a complicated joint. I had [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=732.12s)]

*  I do that every day that changed everything for you [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=750.6s)]
*  It makes it so that I don't need surgery because I'm supposed to go back for more back surgery [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=752.88s)]
*  I was supposed to do that two years ago for another disc. Yeah another one, but I'm [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=757.2s)]
*  Delaying that as long as possible and you know doing these stretches man [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=763.64s)]
*  It takes about an hour and a half to do these stretches every day [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=767.0s)]
*  But it makes it manageable where I could you know tie my shoelaces without pain, you know [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=769.4s)]
*  Yeah, lower backs are a motherfucker. Yeah. Yeah, so whatever we can do to avoid surgery [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=774.88s)]
*  It's amazing. Look at yawn first shoulder operate on unfortunately [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=781.16s)]

*  I try to do something with physiotherapy and doctors to try to fix it, but every training was worse [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=812.32s)]
*  Yeah, now remember to he's also 42 years old. Uh-huh. Yeah [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=817.12s)]

*  I think he's 34 35 [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=844.12s)]
*  But it's a he hasn't really beat anybody of note [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=846.52s)]
*  But he hasn't really beat any of the top guys to get to this so [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=850.88s)]
*  Him versus yawns fun and there's also his first fight like his first fight with Kennedy Kennedy and Zichaku [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=854.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, who beat him down like he was beating Kennedy up and then he gassed out and he fucked him up [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=860.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like that's a that's a big fight because he kind of folded [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=864.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah down the stretch over, you know over amped in the beginning of the fight burned off too much fuel just experience experience [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=868.3000000000001s)]
*  It's like Sean Brady in the main event like when they gave him below he just wasn't ready [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=874.6800000000001s)]
*  Right and then loses that and then goes on a tear. Yeah, and like now he's ready now [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=878.9000000000001s)]
*  He's ready. Yeah, well, sometimes it takes that had mental coaching. Yeah, too. Yeah, I think it's how are your shoulders good [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=883.98s)]

*  Blue school do you inject it or you take it? No, it's a serum. Okay, so you put it on the muscle [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=977.3s)]
*  You put it on your tongue. No, you put it on your tongue every morning every night [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=982.68s)]
*  And I'm like how much say take I'll take double is it? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=986.6999999999999s)]

*  Feeling healthy. Does it make you feel great? Oh, yeah, I feel great. Wow, but you're doing a lot of stuff [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=994.9000000000001s)]
*  I think I don't know. I don't know and like then I stumbled upon was it methanol blue. Yeah, do you take my thought? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=999.84s)]
*  Yeah, right. I got shit. Yeah, he's seen stuff. That's not how you say it [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1006.62s)]
*  What is the actual methylene methylene methylene methylene? Dude, it's on me all the time. Yeah, do you want some? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1010.94s)]
*  Yeah, I take it it's it's like a what do we say a nootropics? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1017.42s)]
*  Wow, it's basically an MAO inhibitor and it also has something that does something for your mitochondria [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1022.66s)]
*  I'm not the guy to describe it [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1030.1399999999999s)]
*  But Gary Brekha told me to take it and quite a few other people told me to take it [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1031.62s)]
*  Yeah, I just stumbled because I take creatine for neurological reasons and for muscle recovery [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1035.94s)]
*  Yeah, and then I'm taking so many nootropics [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1041.02s)]
*  I feel like I leveled out and then someone recommend this this methanol blue methylene methylene blue [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1043.86s)]
*  Yeah, and that took you to another level. Oh, yeah. I mean three four times a day. Let's go three or four times a day [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1050.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're supposed to do it one a day, bro [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1057.06s)]
*  Yeah, this is great from diesel subs feeling a test rat yeah, yeah, yeah when they go does it work I think so probably [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1065.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1073.02s)]
*  One of the full combos work one of them is gonna work now with the UFC being involved in grappling [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1074.54s)]
*  They're not thinking about drug testing anybody are they I don't think so as far as I know no [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1080.3799999999999s)]
*  Because none of the other organizations test right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1086.06s)]
*  It's like unless you're gonna sign which is starting to happen now because there's a little bit more money IBJJF tests [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1088.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. Yeah, okay. That's it [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1094.46s)]
*  You know, they're starting to sign people exclusive now because there's a little bit more money [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1097.98s)]
*  Yeah, but unless you're gonna test across every organization is gonna test and it doesn't make sense because any guys who are guys who? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1101.5s)]
*  Are tested in the UFC who are fighting on flow or at one or other events who are fighting guys who are juiced anyway [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1108.82s)]
*  So right the whole reason to have testing is to have guys who are not on steroids compete against one another [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1114.1799999999998s)]
*  But if they came up with an organization that came up with the most money and said but here's the rules [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1119.34s)]
*  We're gonna go you SADA [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1123.98s)]
*  Yeah, that would that would work [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1125.6599999999999s)]
*  But the problem is is that you need a business model where you can make that amount of money back right like [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1127.54s)]
*  Just just to pay for testing like most of the guys so competing on like the undercard or like not even the main event guys [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1132.54s)]
*  You would actually be losing money testing them regularly [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1139.22s)]
*  Also dolls down the sport, but also when when the UFC signs [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1142.4599999999998s)]
*  Just like say Mikey Musa Meshie. Is it exclusive? Can you not compete anywhere else? So usually when they do exclusive [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1147.1799999999998s)]
*  I don't know what his contract is obviously [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1153.6799999999998s)]
*  But usually they're usually it's exclusive, but they have cutouts for things like a DCC [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1155.54s)]
*  You're like big world championships. Otherwise, it's hard to sign the guys completely [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1160.42s)]
*  Say you'd have to pay my salary like for example if if you have see signed Mikey exclusive [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1164.06s)]
*  Then he wanted to do a DCC but it's on flow like a lot of times the guys have cutouts for that like big [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1169.8999999999999s)]
*  Bro, she makes it ornaments. That's cool because it helps everybody. Yeah, it's cool [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1175.78s)]
*  Just build the brand you want to be stuck there [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1178.78s)]
*  Like a guy for a guy exclusive to flow or to UFC wouldn't be able to compete for like flow grappling or one normally [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1181.62s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, so is one still doing a lot of grappling. I know they got the rotolo's [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1188.1s)]
*  Mike he's gone. I think Cade's doing MMA now. Okay. Yeah, he's to know he looks like a demon out there [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1194.5s)]
*  Oh, he looks like a sad [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1200.6599999999999s)]
*  He's fucking people up striking. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, it's like having a guy like that [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1203.54s)]
*  That's the that elite with grappling and also young enough to learn striking and get rid and just wild [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1208.74s)]
*  Dude, they get all aggressive dude great work [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1214.46s)]
*  I think they gave him like a tough matchup to a second fight in one championship like a tough fucking wrestler [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1216.7s)]
*  He fucking annihilated this dude. Is Gary Tone and still in one [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1221.54s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he was his contract ended. He was doing some negotiations [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1226.78s)]
*  But as far as I know, I I think he's going back to one but I'm not a hundred hundred percent sure be great to see [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1230.58s)]
*  Jimmy can you bring up the one champ? One championship has a big [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1236.82s)]
*  More tight fight like huge Muay Thai fight like one of the biggest ever [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1240.26s)]
*  So wait to it. There's everybody watching at home Rod first fight is right about to start and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1244.5s)]
*  we are [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1251.4199999999998s)]
*  Mark Goddard is waiting to kick it off. He's moving to the center of the octagon now and [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1253.3s)]
*  It goes and the time is 457 456 455 454 453 [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1259.46s)]
*  We're off [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1266.82s)]
*  How do you say that dude's name Shari Shari? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1268.74s)]
*  Shari Shari Shari [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1272.4199999999998s)]
*  This is in London, yes, sir [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1277.7s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about these guys. I don't know much. I didn't study this. He's 12 and 3 Brendan [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1282.02s)]
*  I wish I wish you don't know. Oh my god. No, I know some I got some things. Who is he five eight first round finishes [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1287.4199999999998s)]
*  The that's really good [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1294.68s)]
*  Man Brendan got stung. Yeah, it gets crispy off this but what I was gonna say is I wish we were seeing John Jones Aspinall in London [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1297.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they should be saying [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1305.48s)]
*  But I think John's gonna hold out as long as he can to make the most money and then which you can't be mad at [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1307.36s)]
*  But also, you know Tom Aspinall I think soon he'll be the interim champ for the longest ever over 500 days. That's not good [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1312.2s)]
*  No, that's kind of crazy 500 days 500 days as well [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1319.3999999999999s)]
*  It's kind of crazy and John said he wants six months to train which is that's just negotiation tactics [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1322.28s)]
*  Like dude, he's been on your radar for three years and you took two years to get ready for heavyweight. What are we doing? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1327.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean John get your money so meticulous in his preparation [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1332.62s)]
*  Like you've worked with John you trained with him when he was getting ready for steep a yeah [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1337.16s)]
*  We did the first camp I was with them for like a couple weeks and then the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1341.02s)]
*  Then steep they got hurt and then the second camp. Oh, oh, here we go. Someone got hurt [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1345.8799999999999s)]
*  He dropped them. I didn't see with what but he definitely dropped him [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1352.56s)]
*  So but yeah the second camp I was with him for like a full like six or seven weeks [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1357.56s)]
*  So that was a and do you think Tom Aspinall's like John's gonna get him down if you got him down [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1362.32s)]
*  John as far as being an Aspinall's guard you think it'd be an issue for John at all? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1368.2s)]
*  No, I think that I think Tom would probably be trying to stand up [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1373.16s)]
*  I don't and Tom also has pretty good like fast takedowns. So yeah, they could both take one another down. Yeah [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1377.72s)]
*  But I don't think that Tom is gonna be able to like really do anything besides try to get up on John [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1384.92s)]
*  Yeah, I try and get that mounted he had he's been doing jitsu since he was a kid, you know [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1391.2s)]
*  It's rare. You have a big guy with good hips dogfight. Oh, he's so fast to [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1396.6000000000001s)]
*  Aspinall like as a heavyweight, there's no one like him. The only knock-on we really haven't seen just his defense [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1401.24s)]
*  Yeah, his head is [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1406.96s)]
*  Fight I did see him lose. He got heel hooked and it was a pretty shitty heel lock that he tapped to so [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1409.24s)]
*  Aspinall yeah, when was that? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1414.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you got a heel hook yeah, yeah interesting he's undefeated there was a then it was a it means a long time ago [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1420.28s)]
*  He's obviously gotten much better, but it was a pretty shitty heel look. No kidding [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1426.64s)]
*  Was it an amateur fighter was it a pro fight? It's a pro fight [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1430.24s)]
*  Here's something to think about think of whatever reason John decides he doesn't want to fight Aspinall [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1433.48s)]
*  What the fuck do you do with Aspinall right? There's no heavyweight divisions never been worse. It's never been worse [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1437.8400000000001s)]
*  It's awful. Like there's Cyril gone right here. Oh [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1444.48s)]
*  Pull that head down he sticks to the head just concentrates on the head [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1448.16s)]
*  Might be able to get it if he would ask me a few weeks ago [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1453.4s)]
*  I would say have Alex move up, but Alex just lost. Yeah, that was the bummer [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1456.5200000000002s)]
*  I heard that Alex fought with a broken here. It is. Here's a heel hook [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1460.52s)]
*  It's actually a heeled kneebar [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1466.24s)]
*  So here it is [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1468.72s)]
*  Who's this guy? So you see he just scoops the leg from half guard Tom [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1470.36s)]
*  Tom was whooping his ass Tom turns away instead of trying to face him [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1474.96s)]
*  So it exposes the heel and it turns into a heel kneebar. Oh weird [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1478.6s)]
*  There's a heel hook, but it's a knee bar [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1482.92s)]
*  But with the heel hook gripping so he can't turn back into the lock that dudes in some pub right now gonna [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1484.96s)]
*  Beat that guy. I beat the fucking champ. I beat that fucking champ. This guy keeps trying [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1489.2s)]
*  He's got a creating angle. Oh, he's got both arms shoulders in. Yeah [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1494.88s)]
*  It's gonna go with a dead orchard right in [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1500.24s)]
*  Doesn't work [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1505.04s)]
*  Never working MMA's anybody pulled it off and yeah Elvis Siniseq. Oh, that's he was the first one [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1507.2s)]
*  He was the first one. That's why no one's that's when no one really thought it was like no one really even noticed it [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1512.52s)]
*  Because you're taught you only triangle your legs when there's one arm in one arm out now when there's two arms in [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1518.3799999999999s)]
*  But his legs are so long. He arm bar Jeremy Horn and then when you look at it, you're like, yo [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1524.3s)]
*  He has a he's triangling his legs and he has both arms in whoa. That's kind of a freak thing [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1529.82s)]
*  Yeah, we just thought it was a freak thing and then [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1534.58s)]
*  Nathan orchard and Brian Debs to my guys they just started doing it all the time [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1539.26s)]
*  They go you do we do this all the time. I really you're doing triangle like you got to have long legs [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1544.02s)]
*  You got to have long live you have short legs. You got to do a Mexican dead orchard [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1548.34s)]
*  That's what I do. You got to do a lot of extra labor [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1552.12s)]
*  There's a lot of extra stuff you got to do to put on the Mexican dead orchard. How's it work? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1555.4199999999998s)]
*  You got to do a lot of stuff. You got to go invisible collar to muddy waters and then Mexican dead [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1559.22s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff because if you have long hair or long long [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1563.4599999999998s)]
*  Your heavy metal dude if you have long legs you and you're on the bottom [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1567.1799999999998s)]
*  Depending on how you match up with the guy [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1572.62s)]
*  He can get dead orchard [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1575.2199999999998s)]
*  He could you could triangle your legs with his arms in a perfect defensive position and they get that a lot of times people [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1576.62s)]
*  Get surprised like what the fuck happened [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1581.4599999999998s)]
*  I want how did he triangle his legs that they don't understand but if you have short legs and the guys like this or just [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1582.9799999999998s)]
*  Regular legs there's no way you're gonna be able to triangle your legs with both arms in you need one arm in one arm out [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1588.86s)]
*  so with both arms in [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1593.7399999999998s)]
*  The only way a Mexican or a Chinese guy could do a dead orchard is you got to have this arm down and this arm like this [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1596.3799999999999s)]
*  Like this now I could now I could triangle my legs [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1603.8200000000002s)]
*  You got to do a lot of work [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1606.5s)]
*  You got to get the hand of the mat and then you got to get his elbow and there's a lot of stuff [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1607.5800000000002s)]
*  It's super complicated dead orchards are not the greatest thing for and you got to be super flexible super flexible [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1611.42s)]
*  And you got to put a lot of time into it, but if you have long legs [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1617.66s)]
*  You should be doing dead orchards. It's by far the number one arm bar in the guard [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1622.02s)]
*  No, gee, and there's not even a close second [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1627.0800000000002s)]
*  There's a [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1629.86s)]
*  One of my black belt has 84 dead orchards and his students a purple one has 34 dead orchards in competition [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1631.1399999999999s)]
*  Who has that many orchards Chris Vickers 10th Planet Walnut Creek? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1637.22s)]
*  and dead or [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1642.1s)]
*  There's they happen all the goddamn time Ben Eddie got [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1643.58s)]
*  Wilson Hays in in a combat jujitsu match. He got him in a dead orchard [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1648.3799999999999s)]
*  Wow, Wilson Hays is high level black but he just fought Mighty Mouse for the title a month before [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1652.4199999999998s)]
*  That's high level shit, yeah, you know, but you know but for girls [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1657.8600000000001s)]
*  Girls proportionally have longer legs than guys and more narrow shoulders [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1662.74s)]
*  So if you're a girl out there and you're fighting MMA and you don't have a dead orchard in your game [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1667.26s)]
*  You're missing out. You know, girl girls can do dead orchards at a higher level or a higher rate than guys [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1671.82s)]
*  Who's sure who's just because of the body type who you think has the best guard in MMA? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1677.74s)]
*  Is it Olivera or Paul Craig? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1681.66s)]
*  Mmm [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1684.5s)]
*  Paul Craig's got a fucking pretty nasty guard Paul Craig so dangerous boat and they could even take him down [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1685.74s)]
*  Yeah, right. There's so few fighters with dangerous guards in MMA. Right? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1691.46s)]
*  Fabrizio was one [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1696.8200000000002s)]
*  Fabrizio's Fabrizio Verdoom is the overlooked goat heavyweight. I would say Paul Craig. Yeah [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1699.7s)]
*  Uncle I have in Jamal Hill. He's got two world champions [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1706.22s)]
*  Arm barred both of them triangle them arm barred them. That's very impressive [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1709.3400000000001s)]
*  We got got a little Jamal's arm member drop Jamal's arms flopping all over the place [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1714.14s)]
*  He's beating on him as far as jiu-jitsu eyes you got gutter Nelson on the card tonight and then Sean Brady's no punk either [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1718.3s)]
*  Sean Brady's a black belt. He's wicked Philadelphia gorilla and I'm sure Gordon like to point out that he beat Craig Jones in competition [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1723.38s)]
*  He did be Craig Jones [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1729.8s)]
*  That was one of them deals where you couldn't do heel hooks though, right? Yeah [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1734.7s)]
*  I think I believe leg locks were illegal. Yeah, that's a little sus, but I mean still he's an MMA guy who fights at 170 [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1737.54s)]
*  Well, he's a fucking beast. No. Yeah, no doubt. He's got like a turtle shell for a back. No, he's a great [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1745.1s)]
*  He's a great grappler, which is why I'm excited to watch this. Yeah, his back is like triple thick [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1750.26s)]
*  He's got like you John. My son Brady. Yeah, his back is like extra muscles [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1754.6599999999999s)]
*  You see what he's do and Leon Edwards in the way and she's like, I realize how small he is [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1758.8s)]
*  I'm definitely have a strength advantage. You like oh answer that but yeah, you're like, oh buddy [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1762.94s)]
*  Oh boy, you got to educate yourself. Well, Leon was saying at the way is too small [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1767.06s)]
*  I'm gonna take him out like he might be shorter than you but [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1771.3s)]
*  He's a fucking chimp. Yeah, you get to hold you you got real problems. Know what he did to Kelvin [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1775.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's manhandled Kelvin Gilbert burns a hell of a wrestler. Yeah. Hell yeah hell of a wrestler [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1780.66s)]
*  No, anyone who fights on Braves like he's the strongest guy we were [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1785.7s)]
*  All of them say it. Yeah, so Joe Piper says yeah, and Joe Piper is fucking huge huge [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1789.06s)]
*  That's a guy who collar hands has a guy we're like, huh? Fuck do you make 85? Wow? How do you make 85 Gordon in your opinion? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1794.74s)]
*  What's the best leg lock for MMA? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1801.6200000000001s)]
*  best leg lock position [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1803.8600000000001s)]
*  You're training someone he wants to learn leg locks. What do you think? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1805.8600000000001s)]
*  Well for you guys to be called the honey hole but for us cross-ashigurumi or inside Tsingaku. Yeah inside Tsingaku [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1810.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's the best one you think [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1816.8600000000001s)]
*  One of them and then what do you think about putting it on the outside and go on Z lock? That's great, too [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1819.3400000000001s)]
*  So it seems like anything on the outside it turns the guy and he really can't hit you because really it's about being [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1824.22s)]
*  Safe from strikers and 50-50. I think everyone agrees if you see 50-50 in MMA and it works [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1830.3799999999999s)]
*  But you can still reach the guy's face, but you can't really hit him that hard 50-50 50-50 [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1836.7s)]
*  You can get hit [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1841.6599999999999s)]
*  Outside ashigurumi or you guys call that's the worst one. You get hit [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1842.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's the worst but any like inside Tsingaku or if you pass leg across so we call it inside [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1846.06s)]
*  Ashigurumi where you have the that's how I finished Nicky Rod where you have the legs triangle inside [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1850.94s)]
*  But the legs pass to the outside so you have an outside heel hook [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1855.5s)]
*  That's great. But because everyone's breaking mechanics are not up to par on outside heel hooks [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1860.18s)]
*  It's harder to get catastrophic breaks on outside heel hooks [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  so for a may if you have good breaking mechanics like Paul Horace finished a lot of [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1869.3s)]
*  Outside heel hooks, but his breaking mechanics were pretty good. Yeah [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1874.6200000000001s)]
*  The legs inside with the foot outside is best [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1878.4s)]
*  Otherwise just keep the foot on the other side and go for the inverted. So if this leg was reaping [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1881.52s)]
*  This foot would be on the outside right like this. Yeah, so you have an outside heel. We call that the Indian. Yeah [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1888.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. That's Gary heel looking on the inside. Yeah [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1893.3600000000001s)]
*  But so yeah, so so it's a it's hard for the guy to the guy can't hit you from here [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1897.32s)]
*  He can't really throw any punches to your face [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1901.32s)]
*  Anything that anytime you reap like which which which is that left leg going on the inside makes it hard for the guy to hit [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1903.48s)]
*  So most people think all leg locks don't work in MMA. You're gonna get smashed. That's not true [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1910.48s)]
*  Some leg locks will save your ass. That was a fight in the UFC some Brazilian guy forget [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1915.72s)]
*  It was in the ultimate fighter [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1919.66s)]
*  He was on his back getting walloped and the guy was like had a horse stance on top of him against the cage [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1920.6000000000001s)]
*  It was throwing down and that Brazilian just jumped jumped on a on a kneebar a kneebar attempt [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1926.3200000000002s)]
*  And that saved him because now you can't now that he's punching his ass [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1932.52s)]
*  All right, and then from the kneebar he got knocked down on his back on his butt [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1937.0s)]
*  And then I turned around jumped on his back and choked him out [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1942.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you're seeing a lot of heel hooks because a lot of guys just aren't very efficient [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1944.84s)]
*  They're like they're not focusing on it [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1948.8s)]
*  Ryan Hall was one of the first to come in and really do some damage with leg locks [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1950.64s)]
*  Yeah, he got BJ Penn pretty quick. Mm-hmm. The number one determining factor of with with leg locking is [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1953.92s)]
*  And so far as getting hit is [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1960.2s)]
*  In order for the person to actually hit you they have to come up on top of you and put weight onto you [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1963.68s)]
*  So the number one determining factor is can I keep this guy's head? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1968.1200000000001s)]
*  If I can get if you're attacking and you're trying to punch the guy if you can get your head over his head [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1971.4s)]
*  You can hit with power. Yeah, so any leg locking position [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1976.76s)]
*  Which doesn't allow your opponent to get head overhead is what's gonna keep you safe. So basically double outside [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1979.76s)]
*  What do you guys call double outside? That's the worst one [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1985.08s)]
*  That's because the guy can come forward into you and get head overhead [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1988.4s)]
*  Yeah, you you either get that heel hook quick or you're gonna take some damage [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1991.0s)]
*  But anything where you're reaping which doesn't allow him to come forward into you [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=1996.64s)]
*  So break his own leg if he stacks you yeah, and he can't get head overhead [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2000.16s)]
*  This is what you should be looking for. But if the guy can get head overhead then he can hit you easy [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2003.56s)]
*  Yeah, you going over leg locks with John Jones. Is he is he pretty good at him now? Yeah [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2007.1200000000001s)]
*  He kind of just bounces around from thing to thing like he'll like oh I want to go over some leg locks and like [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2012.86s)]
*  You'll teach him a move and be like so Darcy's like a question on Darcy [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2017.3s)]
*  It's like it's like just ADHD just bound but how we learned like he just bounces from move to move [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2020.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah the first time I met him [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2025.1s)]
*  It was his first fight when he fought Stefan Bonner and we were at it was in Boston and we were at a boxing gym [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2028.18s)]
*  And I was just hanging out with you because you were taking a private with [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2034.3s)]
*  Who was the guy from Amsterdam that you were taking privates? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2037.66s)]
*  Shoot no, it was shoot. It was either Shooky or Rob came in it was one of them [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2040.46s)]
*  We were in some random boxing gym in Boston and I was just sitting at on on the ring [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2045.0600000000002s)]
*  It must have been Rob if we were in Boston waiting waiting for you to be done and then no one knew who John Jones was [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2050.32s)]
*  it was his first fight he's sitting there and [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2055.34s)]
*  He comes up to me and he and he asked for advice. He goes, what do you think? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2058.02s)]
*  You know, you got any advice for me now? I didn't know and he was fighting Stefan Bonner and I thought oh they're feeding Stefan Bonner [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2061.86s)]
*  Like I felt bad for John Jones. So what I told him is is there's two kinds of wrestlers that [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2068.7400000000002s)]
*  Coming to MMA wrestlers that love jujitsu and wrestlers that want to beat jujitsu [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2076.46s)]
*  I go don't be one of those wrestlers that wants to beat jujitsu fall in love with it fall in love with [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2081.3s)]
*  Submissions because the guys the guys that want to beat it. They never last they're eventually gonna get taken out [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2087.3s)]
*  Also wrestlers have such an advantage of being able to manipulate bodies [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2092.86s)]
*  The scariest jujitsu guys for the most part are guys that wrestle their whole life [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2096.2799999999997s)]
*  And then they fall in love with jujitsu and they love pulling guard and all that like oh scary [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2102.32s)]
*  Think about the guys John Jones submitted. Oh, yeah over Liotto. Yeah [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2107.36s)]
*  Stefan Bonner fight wasn't he like to beat the shit out of him [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2114.36s)]
*  Elbow beat the shit. Yeah, you remember when we talked him we talked him into going to a big camp [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2119.12s)]
*  Do you remember that conversation? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2124.46s)]
*  We're at the roof of the hotel [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2127.3399999999997s)]
*  Hanging out and he was saying what do you think I should do? I said you're too good [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2130.38s)]
*  You need to be at a big camp. You need to be around killers. You can't you're so good [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2134.04s)]
*  You're gonna get by a long way on your own [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2138.38s)]
*  I go but you need like high-level coaching like you're you're a world champion. Did you recommend Jackson's to him? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2141.1s)]
*  I did not he found Jackson's. Yeah. Well Jackson's was huge at the time [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2147.18s)]
*  You know so many SP it's such a great gym, I mean you can't go wrong with those guys and Greg is just such a great [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2151.2999999999997s)]
*  mind for [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2157.42s)]
*  Legit kickboxer, which is a winkle. Yeah, she'd kick he fought Johnny Viterio. Yeah [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2163.98s)]

*  Winkle John's a legit striker and then you got all those other people over there, too [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2171.62s)]
*  It's like such a killer lineup. I was there during John's heyday man. Yeah, you were yeah [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2175.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's heyday still going on man, especially at heavyweight. We just don't know he's not active enough [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2180.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's really there's one fight man. There's one fight and then after that after that [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2186.96s)]

*  Which I think the John would be an underdog in the fight [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2196.92s)]
*  But let's say John beats time that crazy and then retires. It's like all right Tom. I saw still gonna dominate right [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2199.12s)]
*  He's gonna beat him you get Francis to come back [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2204.48s)]

*  She ended up getting her back at the end and winning but it was scary for a second [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2595.08s)]
*  And that was as a purple belt as a purple belt. She almost beat a world champion. This dude looks like he's had a hard life [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2599.28s)]

*  Yeah, but but if you're topia you're not gonna go up to 55 without some sort of guarantee cuz remember he's giving up the belt [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2632.16s)]
*  So he's not getting pay-per-view points. It's his idea. Well, cuz the weight cuts too tough. Is that what it is? Yeah [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2638.56s)]
*  Really 45 is too tough for him, but he's been doing it and winning. He's just sick of it [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2644.32s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine that last cut was really tough and his team was like, all right no more Wow [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2648.36s)]
*  What is he? You're not gonna give up the pay-per-view points and just dip out and then just go into the queue at 55 [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2653.2s)]
*  What was he weighing when he was fighting 45? What was he walking around saying like 180 between? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2658.48s)]

*  Fabricio's in GFL GFL's got everybody their Chris Wyman's like I'm retired and the GFL called him [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2881.04s)]
*  I'm on retired back in like they're fighting its end of May [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2886.36s)]
*  But the arena by the USC down there its end of May in LA. What kind of testing got multiple choice. Don't be a hater [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2891.76s)]
*  What's this testing you speak of but dude they get old guys don't don't be cool [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2899.28s)]
*  WWE yeah, let's go back to the old day. We got Dylan Dillon Danis Tony Ferguson like I like it done. That's good [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2906.76s)]
*  That's a good fight. That's I saw that poster [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2913.04s)]
*  It's gotta be fake because there's zero chance that deal. It was that lightweight here. There's no chance [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2915.8799999999997s)]
*  But remember the ways are different their weight cuts different what is 10 pounds? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2921.0s)]
*  So they can agree to fight at a weight that they're both comfortable a legendary lightweight matchup [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2925.12s)]
*  Yeah, but like that could be 65. Yeah, there's no way you make 65 [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2929.64s)]
*  He could like barely make 70 when he was like 170 when he was in shape for ADCC [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2933.72s)]
*  What is their weight classes are different? We pulled it up the other day like middleweight is 200 pounds [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2938.16s)]
*  So maybe look I posted right there comment deal of making lightweight [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2942.96s)]
*  Well, let's see good pull up GFL weight classes Jamie. I think they are they're definitely different. They're different [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2947.76s)]
*  So if Tony goes hey, man, I feel good at whatever 168 170 and and Dylan agrees like yeah [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2954.4s)]
*  I'll fight you at 170. Well, Dylan wasn't even making 170 when he fought in Bellator [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2960.4s)]
*  5050 revenue share he would fight a catchweight [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2964.64s)]
*  Athletes gonna fair share the revenue generated from events ensuring the success is directly linked to the league success [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2967.2s)]
*  Dang, how do they determine that 5050 5050 at once once they get over, you know once they get in the positive [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2972.2799999999997s)]
*  But then also like let how do they know who's moving the needle? They if they all get it. They all get it [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2978.66s)]
*  Yeah, they all get it [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2983.4399999999996s)]
*  Google GFL's weight classes and see if a website explains it on their website [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2985.8399999999997s)]
*  I know but I don't think they have another [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2989.8799999999997s)]
*  Different if they split the profit what if that'll make any profit then nobody gets it [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2993.16s)]
*  Okay, but then what's dope is like let's say Gordon was gonna fight and has and brought in a sponsor and then they want to [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=2996.6s)]
*  sponsor the entire thing he gets [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3003.84s)]
*  20% of anything you bring so featherweight goes up to 55 lightweight is 65 welterweights 80 [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3006.76s)]
*  So how's Dylan dance make it so I'm saying there's zero chance. He's big [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3012.6s)]
*  When he fought in Bellator, he would fight a catchweight. It was 175 [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3017.6s)]
*  I like their light heavyweight 225 that I wish they had that when I was fighting [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3020.84s)]
*  They should have a shape of his life. Maybe maybe yeah, maybe go any fight any fighting KSI in boxing. So should I just pulled out? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3025.56s)]
*  All right. Well, that's not telling you there's no way don't make high as KSI pull out against Dylan Dennis [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3032.36s)]
*  Like Dylan's on a boxer. KSI is a pretty good boxer. Well, he's legit like for those kind of guys [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3037.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes, you know, he's a good boxer for that class. Did he fight Tommy Shuri? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3043.32s)]
*  Or was he going to he was going to then something happened, right? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3048.44s)]
*  I think but KSI looks legit to me like out of those guys though the influencers. Yeah, he's legit [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3051.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm he's he's got hands. Yeah, and Logan but Dylan is not a boxer. So it's crazy that he would [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3057.96s)]
*  You think he could be not even at his best to take that fight. Yeah, I mean I maybe got hurt [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3065.0s)]
*  I'm not sure I just saw I just saw something that he pulled that I don't even [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3070.48s)]

*  Hitler was ordered to trim his mustache to ensure a proper seal with a gas mask Wow [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3204.6s)]
*  And you got the Michael Jordan mustache as a fun fact of the day Wow Michael Jordan [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3208.8799999999997s)]

*  This is funny that that mustache is gone forever, you know, didn't fight where the game [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3220.16s)]

*  And that's when he decided to run for everything because he thought he was saved by God [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3231.6s)]
*  Because you know, it's like the craziest thing about the gas thing the guy who invented [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3235.54s)]
*  Zyklon a which became zyklon B, which they killed the Jews with that guy Fritz Haber who was a Jew himself [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3240.22s)]
*  He originally when when he invented this he also invented the Haber method for extracting nitrogen [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3247.74s)]
*  From the atmosphere the Haber method is responsible for 50% of the nitrogen in most people's bodies [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3255.38s)]
*  Because the Haber method of extracting nitrogen made it so they could fertilize all kinds of soil [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3262.14s)]
*  So he invents that and he also invents this gas that kills everybody at the same time [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3267.42s)]
*  And there's no odor, right? Well zyklon B. There's no odor. Yeah, zyklon a was invented [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3275.06s)]
*  I think it was a pesticide and the idea was the smell was so awful [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3281.2200000000003s)]
*  So that you would recognize when it was there and you'd get the fuck away from it [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3286.2200000000003s)]
*  Then zyklon B they got rid of the smell [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3290.04s)]
*  But when they were gassing the troops he was being wanted for crimes against humanity [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3292.76s)]
*  For war crimes at the same time. He was gonna win the Nobel Prize for inventing the Haber method [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3298.4s)]
*  Wild and then when Hitler takes over the Jews all get kicked out of Germany and he's kind of sort of privileged because [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3304.84s)]
*  He's a part of the administration [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3312.8s)]
*  But then he gets ostracized and he winds up having to be here and winds up being exiled and he dies on the run [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3314.92s)]
*  He died on the run died on the run died running away from the Nazis. Jesus man. Yeah, why crazy story, dude? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3321.6400000000003s)]

*  No, I mean we talked about a little bit yesterday, but there's I don't know anything like groundbreaking [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=3332.88s)]

*  You're dealing with a 2,000 pound car. Even if it only has 250 horsepower. It's so fun. That's different. It's so it's so different [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4147.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like a you're an amusement park ride, you know [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4155.06s)]

*  I think they're gonna start making less electric vehicles now that trumps in there already doing it [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4202.46s)]
*  Here's the problem with electric vehicles is the number one problem resale terrible to Porsche Taycan's they sell them for like, you know [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4206.66s)]
*  What is a like a Taycan turbo s 160? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4214.5s)]
*  They sell them like a year later [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4218.320000000001s)]
*  200 they lose so much value. I lost my crazy value [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4221.72s)]
*  Why is that because nobody wants to buy a used electric car because the range drops off? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4225.9800000000005s)]
*  So like say if you buy a car fat, right you buy like a 2000 you can buy [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4230.4800000000005s)]

*  300 grand right now right now [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4244.3s)]
*  But you'll think about a better comparison would be think about like your your 4 GT a 2006, right? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4246.3s)]
*  They're 500 grand minimum now, right? That's the different because that's like a classic. It's 20 years old [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4252.3s)]
*  Sure, but a new car say like say if you get like a new AMG GT and you know, it's a 2025 [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4258.860000000001s)]
*  You sell it next year. You're not gonna lose much money [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4266.38s)]
*  If you sell like a Ferrari you lose no money [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4268.5s)]

*  Yeah, there's a bunch of videos from a few days ago that this is all just non-sensory I generated that's interesting [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4618.46s)]
*  Wow that right there. That's what I saw yeah, that'd be a dope podcast to do to put a middle of nowhere [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4623.9800000000005s)]

*  Yeah, they go deep in they got you well. They get you man these AI things are nuts man. I've been fooled [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4645.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I've seen AI things with my own voice on I'm like wow this is crazy, and I know it's fake [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4651.34s)]
*  Speaking speaking of fakery when you had Mel Gibson on your podcast the other day [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4657.82s)]
*  He brought up the shroud of Turin. Yeah, and I always thought that was fake like in the 80s [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4663.98s)]
*  What is that the shroud? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4668.339999999999s)]
*  It's like the the cloth that Jesus was buried in and left an image of them and in the 80s like 1988 [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4669.5s)]
*  They did carbon dating on it. They go. It's fake see that [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4676.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, literally has an image of Jesus burned into it somehow or another [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4681.98s)]
*  I never looked into it [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4686.9s)]
*  I just figured it was fake but listening to you and Mel Gibson talk about it. It's real is there well apparently [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4687.98s)]
*  It's a lot older than they assumed when they did the first testing and one of the problems is holy shit cross contamination [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4693.58s)]
*  There's also been repairs to it, but they did subsequent testing and they found that it was like [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4701.5s)]
*  2,000 plus years old yeah, and the one thing the one thing to know most it's the most studied [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4706.54s)]
*  Artifact ever like particle physicists nuclear engineers they all studied it and they some of them [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4712.740000000001s)]
*  Some believe in it some don't believe in it, but they all agree on one thing no one knows [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4720.58s)]
*  How they did it right? There's no one else have made it. There's no paint. There's no die [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4726.26s)]
*  So dude all this week dude all day. I'm just watching documentary after after podcasts on this shit [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4730.1s)]
*  It's fucking mind-blowing. Yes, pretty crazy mind [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4737.04s)]
*  If it turns out that they can't figure out [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4739.74s)]
*  How anyone could ever do it like if no one has come up with a theory of how to do that today? [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4743.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's where it gets really interesting [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4749.46s)]
*  There's just wasn't paint and it wasn't die and it all agree on that wasn't burn [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4751.58s)]
*  They all agree [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4755.94s)]
*  It's a mystery because but then the people the skeptics say just because we don't know how it was done doesn't make it real [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4756.54s)]
*  Which is which is a good point, but then the other side's like dude all these scientists have no idea [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4762.5599999999995s)]
*  How they faked it it's got to be real so it's all about how you look at it [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4768.14s)]
*  I'm on the side there's a there's a nuclear engineer most fun. There's a nuclear engineer [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4772.06s)]
*  You can go on YouTube his name is Roger Robert Rucker [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4776.86s)]
*  Watch his breakdown or this guy's a nuclear dude. He's breaking down the phone [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4780.54s)]
*  He it's it's insane because it's a negative image on a non photographic [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4784.26s)]
*  Material linen right and then it turns out like if you look at it with the naked eye [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4791.02s)]
*  It's white and then you see the image of the face is kind of like yellow [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4796.9s)]
*  you can barely see it but in like [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4799.7s)]
*  1898 some photographer took a picture of it and then flipped and then looked at the negative and then all of a sudden in the negative [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4802.219999999999s)]
*  the whole body appears front and back because he was buried like with a [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4809.379999999999s)]
*  He was buried with the sheet under him and it went around his head [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4815.58s)]
*  That's the back of him cuz he yeah, the right one's the back and the left one's the front. That's crazy [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4819.62s)]
*  No one knows how they did it and no no sign the holes where the wrist would be nailed [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4824.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking crazy. That was the thing with with Jesus with me. It's very hard [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4829.58s)]
*  It was always very hard to believe in Jesus. I'm like do the resurrection like that's a hard one to wrap your brain around, right? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4834.32s)]
*  I could believe that he existed I could I could believe that he got crucified a lot of people got crucified [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4840.179999999999s)]
*  But the resurrection was always the thing that kept me from really believing in Jesus. I'm like there's no way that [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4844.82s)]
*  Resurrection was real but even this is real. It doesn't mean he was resurrected, right? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4850.459999999999s)]
*  It just means you just crucified and he was actual real man [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4854.1s)]
*  No, the thing is is how the image got on [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4856.42s)]
*  It's just the people that believe that it's real believe that when he was resurrected some kind of ultraviolet radiation [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4860.46s)]
*  Some kind of burst made that image because that's because that image has never been on any other shroud [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4867.42s)]
*  There people get buried in shrouds all the time. There's never an image like that [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4872.5s)]
*  Pretty crazy and the crazy thing is the blood there's no image under the blood [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4876.5s)]
*  So the blood was there first and then the image is after [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4881.52s)]
*  It's crazy shit [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4886.4800000000005s)]
*  Dude, I'm like I I went deep down a rabbit all week [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4888.240000000001s)]
*  Just watching the skeptics the scientists particle physics [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4892.8s)]
*  They they have no idea how the fuck that image got on the front and back the back of them, too [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4896.64s)]
*  Pretty weird [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4904.54s)]
*  It's crazy [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4907.46s)]
*  Apparently there's some structures underneath the pyramids [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4909.46s)]
*  How they not like that that before well fuck they don't know whether or not that's legit or where these guys are jumping in [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4913.3s)]
*  conclusions a lot of people are calling bullshit and saying they jump to conclusions a lot of people are saying that it really [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4919.4800000000005s)]
*  You can't tell from those images like what they drew in the you know [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4925.42s)]
*  The 3d image where they drew everything and made a model of it. They're doing a lot of guessing [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4929.94s)]
*  So they're gonna they're gonna do more testing though. There's definitely something under someone's [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4935.259999999999s)]
*  Something is under there something's under there and it's massive and if these guys are correct that it goes down two kilometers like [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4940.9s)]
*  Help me explain that explain that with any conventional wisdom [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4948.379999999999s)]
*  That's more than a mile into the earth. That's fucking nuts [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4952.86s)]
*  Yeah, like what is what does that mean like what who did that and what was the purpose of it? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4956.7s)]
*  Because there's a guy named Christopher Dunn that thinks that the entire [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4961.24s)]
*  Giza pyramid the big one the Great Pyramid was a power plant and he has this whole [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4964.58s)]
*  Schematic that he mapped out like this is how you would generate hydrogen [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4969.86s)]
*  You would have something underneath the surface under the underneath the ground that was causing a vibration a pounding and then this [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4973.0599999999995s)]
*  Reverberation this this vibration would go through the entire building because it was all made out of limestone and then they had these [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4982.22s)]
*  channels these paths that they would fill with chemicals and they would go into what's called the King's Chamber and this [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4989.7s)]
*  Porous limestone that would allow the chemicals to leap through the leech through and that would create hydrogen. Yeah. Yeah, so I mean I'm doing I'm butchering it [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=4995.66s)]
*  I'm sorry, mr. Dunn [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5002.9400000000005s)]
*  But if you listen to his take on it, he's an engineer [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5004.3s)]
*  He explains why the pathways and everything this is exactly how you would do it if it was some sort of a power plant [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5007.98s)]
*  But whatever it is, it's like I don't think that it's a tomb [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5015.0199999999995s)]
*  I just I just don't think that makes any sense [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5017.86s)]
*  Remember your bit where you said I bet people used to be really smart [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5020.5s)]

*  I mean the pyramids for sure a gold are a mystery like how the fuck do they build those and now [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5030.62s)]
*  Finding out what's underneath them like fuck who knows go go Beckley Tepe. There's all these [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5037.58s)]
*  mysterious [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5043.780000000001s)]

*  Cathedrals like think about power tools were invented in the 1890s and they're talking about these insane [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5052.26s)]
*  cathedrals all over the world cars out of stone [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5058.18s)]
*  With no power tools, right? How the fuck did they build like you ever seen that one in India? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5061.58s)]
*  There's there's a few of them in India, but there's one that's all carved out of stone [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5067.26s)]
*  They didn't bring any rocks there. They don't know where the stone went. Yeah, it's all [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5072.34s)]
*  Insanely intricate and carved out of stone and fucking massive and they're everywhere. Do you know where to South America Asia? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5078.18s)]
*  China look at that. Look at that, bro. They carved that out of solid stone [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5086.1s)]
*  They might have been bored as fuck. Look how tiny the people are down there. It's not shit [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5090.74s)]
*  You know long that would take yeah, yeah, yeah hundreds of years [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5094.66s)]
*  The craftsmanship is [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5099.26s)]
*  Spectacular and no one knows how old that is. It's like take it. So so you [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5102.54s)]

*  Yeah, if that proves to be true and there really are these massive structures underneath the pyramid they got to change those thing [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5156.66s)]
*  There's dude. There's past civilizations that were super highly advanced. There's gotta be I mean, you know what? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5163.78s)]
*  I have a hard time getting into but I [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5170.02s)]
*  Every now and then I'll dive into it Giants Giants Giants. That's another [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5172.06s)]
*  Move and all that shit [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5177.860000000001s)]
*  Well, they're not I don't know about that because I think you need a lot more than Giants to move those fucking stones [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5178.9400000000005s)]
*  You you need some kind of crazy technology because Giants don't explain the engineering [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5183.14s)]
*  It doesn't explain the the precision that was involved like whatever they did [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5187.3s)]
*  They were they were moving 80 tons stones from 500 miles away and through the mountains and there's no roads and no one knows [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5191.06s)]
*  How they did it? There's no explanation your Instagram algorithm. Fuck you up with the the giant AI videos. Oh, yeah [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5198.660000000001s)]
*  Huge pyramids 70 foot dudes carrying giant stones like jacks shredded, you know [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5207.18s)]
*  I there's a lot of reports throughout the ages of giant human beings, you know [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5212.9800000000005s)]
*  And it look what's a giant nine feet tall ten feet tall [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5218.42s)]
*  It's a fucking giant like a race of nine foot ten feet tall people and there's all these stories about like bones that were giant [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5221.700000000001s)]
*  Bones that got transported this Missoni in they covered it up and I assume they don't live long because they're so big so they [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5227.200000000001s)]
*  Know [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5233.2s)]
*  Robert Wadlow was a eight foot eleven. He's like on record the tall right? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5235.48s)]
*  Yeah, he had like a serious disease. Yeah now imagine a foot taller than that guy jacked [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5240.639999999999s)]
*  But just a different kind of human being have you heard of the little season? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5245.96s)]
*  It's in the in the Bible they talk about the little season [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5249.8s)]
*  No, we get a coke. Well the in the Bible it didn't get you a cocoa [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5252.5s)]
*  I asked you when you were leaving and get a coke [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5257.56s)]
*  But no, I'm good in in the Bible apparently it you know [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5261.96s)]
*  Your average Christian thinks tribulation is coming right Jesus gonna is gonna eventually come right tribulation [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5266.360000000001s)]
*  We're gonna be judged right and then there's gonna be a one thousand year millennial where [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5271.64s)]
*  Jesus returns and rules for a thousand years and all the resurrected [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5277.76s)]
*  Apostles are gonna be kings and they're gonna rule this realm that we're at that's what they tribulation [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5282.0s)]
*  Jesus returns a thousand year millennia. This is in the Bible and then after the thousand year and then during those thousand years [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5286.96s)]
*  There's a guy named Paul stops I had on my podcast he told me all about this you he's on the YouTube [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5295.92s)]
*  Understanding conspiracies on YouTube Paul stops. He's he's amazing. He's talking about so that that's what we're waiting for [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5301.4800000000005s)]
*  Jesus returned he rules for a thousand years. He's the king of this earth and [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5308.52s)]
*  Then after the and then while while those thousand years are going on Satan is chained to the lake of fire [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5314.280000000001s)]
*  So there's no Satan. It's just Jesus and his Apostles [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5321.080000000001s)]
*  Ruling and then after the thousand years [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5324.400000000001s)]
*  This called the little satanic season. It's in the Bible to I check doc the little season where Jesus on [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5327.4400000000005s)]
*  lets Satan go and then Satan rules this earth and he influences all the nations and it's called the little satanic season and [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5334.56s)]
*  that and the purpose of that is to to test people like work and [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5343.52s)]
*  There's a there's a theory. There's a theory that he [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5348.080000000001s)]
*  Already ruled for he came back in the Apostles lifetime and ruled [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5352.64s)]
*  They already did that a thousand year millennial and now we're in the little season right now [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5356.200000000001s)]
*  Doesn't it seem like Satan is like influencing all the nations doesn't it seem like an evil world? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5360.84s)]
*  Well, it seems like evil has always been a part of the human race. There's always been people [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5365.96s)]
*  Genocide there's always been evil. There's always been people that justify murder for money [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5371.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know bombings of fucking apartment buildings. I sent them a link like a like a two-minute video [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5376.0s)]
*  Jamie can you play this real quick? This guy explains it's really and then you'll see all the structures so that explains [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5384.08s)]
*  So there's a theory is a theory that it explains all these structures that were built by angels [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5389.92s)]
*  Well, you gotta wonder when you get back to that Zechariah stitch and stuff because one of the things about this whole [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5396.400000000001s)]
*  Anunnaki thing was that there were giants and [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5402.26s)]
*  The big theories of the Giants bred with human beings which probably means some sort of genetic engineering like taking [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5405.320000000001s)]
*  Like existing primates and and turning them into human beings. Yeah. Yeah, I mean if you I [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5411.68s)]
*  Mean, those are the most fun [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5419.16s)]
*  Those are the most fun the idea that we were visited by an alien and an alien race in this alien race is far superior [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5421.04s)]
*  And that they used us as slaves to mine for gold. Those are the most fun theories [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5427.28s)]
*  Did you get that link? Yes, it was 22 minutes long. No, just play like two minutes [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5432.76s)]
*  I know I'm trying to find a good spot. No right in the right. It's right. What is their mechanisms? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5437.04s)]
*  Getting through space. Oh [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5442.24s)]
*  Like it right at one minute right at like one minute you're right like one just showing videos though [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5445.12s)]
*  No, no, no, but there's talking over it is a narration over it. So try it now [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5450.12s)]
*  So that Paul why you're doing this just stop stop it isn't it's clearly like this is too much right now [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5454.08s)]
*  You just kept pummeling me it's just kept hitting [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5460.96s)]
*  Thoroughly loved it. I've talked about it. He's about to start a hundred people [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5466.12s)]
*  you know everybody I know I'm like [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5471.64s)]
*  You know, there's a theory out there and I didn't I have no clue what I'm talking about [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5474.5599999999995s)]
*  So please [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5477.92s)]
*  This video is called the little season theory number one and the YouTube channels understanding conspiracies the little season theory number one [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5480.56s)]
*  So good [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5489.4s)]
*  Just go start it right there. This is such an any Bravo subject today to walk me through this. Here we go [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5492.72s)]
*  Okay, I'll try and cover most bases [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5498.96s)]
*  I'm not gonna be able to thoroughly explain every single nuance today in like two hours [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5501.72s)]
*  It's just it's just not going to happen. All right [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5506.38s)]
*  well, I'll try my best to do in this talk is give a [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5508.7s)]
*  Foundational overview of most of the talking points involved around this theory and it's a working theory. Let's bear that in mind [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5511.66s)]
*  We're still figuring things out [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5518.04s)]
*  There's multiple options for certain sections of this theory work work could have gone [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5519.54s)]
*  So I'll try my best to relay as much as I can [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5523.86s)]
*  But the basic premise to work off here is that what most modern Christians are waiting for [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5526.66s)]
*  Today is the return of Jesus Christ after the tribulation and we all have our eyes on the signs [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5532.54s)]
*  We'll trying to discern the signs around us trying to determine who the Antichrist will be what the mark of the beast will be [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5539.0199999999995s)]
*  All of those things we're kind of looking for them and waiting for those signs to happen [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5547.0199999999995s)]
*  Which will be the signs of the coming of the Son of Man in the clouds? Okay, which would be tribulation judgments and then obviously a [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5551.58s)]
*  Millennial reign is what people are waiting for and we get to people get to live with Christ for a thousand years as it says [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5559.66s)]
*  and in Revelation 20 [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5566.42s)]
*  So people are pretty adamant. We're living in that time. We're living in the time just before tribulation [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5568.219999999999s)]
*  It's just around the corner. It's just about to happen. Okay, that's what people are pretty adamant where we are [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5573.98s)]
*  That's the mainstream thought of not only conspiracy Christians, but just mainstream church anity [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5579.34s)]
*  That is the view of modern Christians we are in that time [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5584.9s)]
*  They've always been other views out there which say, you know, well, you know, it's a spiritual kingdom and we're living in it now [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5588.299999999999s)]
*  You know that goes on forever and ever and there's no physical kingdom and all these type of things [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5594.66s)]
*  you have a millennial lists who believe that type of thing and [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5599.139999999999s)]
*  What this theory says kind of blows it all out of the water [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5603.74s)]
*  It's it's a completely new take on the situation and there has been a worldview called preterism [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5606.78s)]
*  Which was created a while ago and I think about that sixteen hundreds by [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5611.86s)]
*  Think it was people say it was a Jesuit, but it may have been a Jesuit but this [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5616.94s)]
*  Theory we have today is not preterism classically so-called [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5622.78s)]
*  it's kind of a something else and then a lot of people who don't like this idea will attack preterism and [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5626.38s)]
*  Think that's what we're talking about most preterists even they believe it's a spiritual kingdom and we're not saying that here [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5634.38s)]
*  This is talking about a real physical tangible thousand years were Christ reigned on earth [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5641.06s)]
*  This theory posits it's all already happened. We're not living in the times just before tribulation [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5647.18s)]
*  We're living after the thousand-year reign of Christ [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5653.740000000001s)]
*  He's already been on earth [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5657.700000000001s)]
*  He has reigned for a thousand years on earth with his resurrected saints and the elect who survived through tribulation [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5658.9800000000005s)]
*  Wouldn't there be a record of that and? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5666.38s)]
*  Doesn't that make doesn't it make sense that Christians would document that [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5668.86s)]
*  Over like why why if there was a record and we knew then this wouldn't be a test [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5673.900000000001s)]
*  That wouldn't be a reason for the little season the little satanic season. He let Satan out he unchanged [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5679.62s)]

*  That's a fact to France lost like some insane percentage of their population in World War one some [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5897.32s)]
*  I think they lost 25% of their male population their 18 to 25 or 18 to 30 male [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5903.4s)]
*  Population in World War one and another 25% in World War two late. They paid heavy [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5909.84s)]

*  Mean Russia's been through so much just the amount of people that got starved by Stalin [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5923.8s)]
*  France provided crucial aid to the American colonists during the Revolutionary War including military support financial assistance and naval power ultimately contributing significantly [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5929.16s)]
*  To the American victory and independence yeah, they've helped us through everything [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5936.28s)]
*  Yeah [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=5940.719999999999s)]

*  That was kind of the start of like them stopping all the crazy shit. Well, it's kind of a lot of people woke up the protest [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6000.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6006.94s)]

*  Have you seen the DMT red laser light thing? I've heard about that. Yo, I heard it's nuts [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6035.86s)]
*  Have you know no, but I've seen a bunch of videos on it [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6041.46s)]
*  Apparently you do if you do DMT and you shoot a red laser [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6044.46s)]
*  I said Jamie a video if you see no shoot a red laser you see the matrix you see code [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6048.36s)]
*  Yeah, and everybody sees the same shit everybody not only that but if you like get above the laser and you look down [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6054.219999999999s)]
*  Yes, you see layers of code. Yes. Yes. Check this out [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6060.74s)]
*  I just saw a video of him saying he saw it too. Yeah [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6065.04s)]
*  Is he a famous scientist or something? No, he was just on the podcast though this guy was yeah [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6068.48s)]
*  He's a mind control expert that explains psyops and how you need on Instagram and I heard you and Danny talking about it [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6073.36s)]
*  So you've done it. Yeah, I saw an Instagram and flew Danny to my house right away [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6080.24s)]
*  I like break this down for people because he's got shared amongst my group and it's like what the fuck [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6085.5199999999995s)]
*  Exactly, and that's the only question you're still gonna have after you see it. It doesn't answer any questions [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6094.5199999999995s)]
*  It just invites a lot more. Yeah, nothing else. There's code [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6099.36s)]
*  Absolutely, there is code so the codes not like spinning there. It's like it's literally they kind of written out static [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6104.16s)]
*  It's static. I can move the laser up and down and see all of the letters [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6110.84s)]
*  But it's like three-dimensional so I can get close to the wall. I [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6116.2s)]
*  Can look down inside of the laser that way and I can look up in the laser that way [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6120.52s)]
*  But your best guess at explaining that I would be a fool. Okay, I love we can just leave it that somebody [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6126.36s)]
*  Right the code consciousness that we're projecting. So they just discovered this [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6134.0s)]
*  Well, I bet some eggheads probably I know I know the guy discovered it will have really I don't know him personally [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6138.24s)]
*  But Brandon McCafferty one of my black belts [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6143.76s)]
*  He knows I'm personally goes dude if you you ever wanted to do your podcast [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6145.76s)]

*  That was seeing the matrix when you're on DMT with a red laser that how crazy any laser [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6155.08s)]
*  It's like a red laser. There's a bunch of videos on YouTube [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6161.64s)]
*  So you like a specific laser or one of you do with a green laser? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6165.1s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know but there's video of a bunch of people that's just one dude [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6167.8s)]

*  Ability, you know, but everybody sees the same shit they see the fucking matrix the numbers the code [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6184.4800000000005s)]
*  Isn't that fucking? [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6192.12s)]

*  Yeah, yeah when he's explaining to you that consciousness creates reality [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6200.56s)]
*  I you know what? I never really took the simulation theory seriously, but [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6205.64s)]
*  You know, I I've always believed like Jesus is a new thing for me like the the Shrouder Turin that that may I'm all [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6211.400000000001s)]
*  In that with the Shrouder Turin, but before that I was like, I don't know about Jesus [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6218.0s)]
*  Maybe but I believe in God and I believe in a creator like whoever created this shit [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6221.76s)]
*  Here we go is God here we go, right? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6226.240000000001s)]
*  Gunna Nelson Kevin home and there must be code on how God created this [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6227.96s)]
*  Yeah, so that that you know, I think science like the simulation guys they're finding [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6232.16s)]
*  What God created like who else could? [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6238.2s)]
*  Put this simulation together, but a God who else here's the craziest theory [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6241.04s)]
*  You know AI is about to become sentient and then they're gonna do quantum computers with AI [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6245.88s)]
*  What if that's how Jesus comes back? What if Jesus? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6251.24s)]
*  re-emerges [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6255.12s)]
*  And he's just a created consciousness and he's on an app [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6256.8s)]
*  By that time and probably able to communicate to your fucking head [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6262.36s)]
*  You mean they they've already figured out how to put signals into people's heads put voices in people's heads [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6266.599999999999s)]

*  Say things to you or you hear voices in your head. Yeah, they have that technology and [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6274.68s)]
*  If quantum computing gets attached to AI and then it figures out how to make better versions of itself [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6280.92s)]
*  Like what does that mean? But isn't that similar like MK ultra what we're doing to compromise people [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6286.32s)]
*  Well, that's right. How's it different though? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6291.52s)]

*  Acids and they were doing all sorts of different psychedelic drugs and doing it to give them [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6296.84s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, but also try to get them to manipulate them so they can get them to do things [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6301.68s)]
*  Like try to kill the putt the president or something like that [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6306.28s)]
*  Like which they still do. Yeah, they have to still do there's no way they stopped doing that [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6309.12s)]
*  And I guarantee if you could if there is a conspiracy theory about that kid in Pennsylvania tried to kill Trump [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6313.36s)]
*  Went to the ground gunner got him down [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6319.88s)]

*  He just got to be super focused and stay at 70 this hopping up and down and you know getting losses at 85 against [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6645.44s)]
*  Deritters like 220 but also being active. It's tough to compete with the biggest guys [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6653.639999999999s)]
*  It it's just tough to be that active right and be a tough guy. He thought comes out at 85 [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6658.32s)]

*  Almost I almost almost has it. Oh, he would have kept stepping inside. He he would have done it [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6688.6s)]
*  Yeah, if he cut a circle a little bit better, but he's gotta be fatigued right now [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6693.88s)]
*  You know two plus minutes into the second and got beat up at the end of the first which takes a lot out of you [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6698.04s)]

*  Especially taking away the front hand [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6750.72s)]
*  He's doing this circular motion with his hand and taking away angles [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6753.360000000001s)]
*  Apparently the run that rematch back. Oh we got down almost they're gonna run it back. I'm sure [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6759.04s)]
*  That's the big fight in that division and if Pereira can come in healthy he's oh we got him down [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6765.12s)]
*  But he's another one. He's too active too active, but he's smart too cuz he's 36 37 [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6771.08s)]
*  He's like, I'm gonna go man. I'm gonna make it much money as possible [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6776.5199999999995s)]
*  He's done that he's made become an all-time great in you know, three years, which is crazy [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6779.4s)]
*  He's give a 10-8 first round got to be 10-8, right? That's hard to say because Gunnar had him down for a while. Yeah [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6783.96s)]
*  You know, I mean judges I got him in a home aplata he did rock him at the end [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6791.0s)]
*  Yeah, I count those and unfortunately they don't count like but near submissions. I think near submissions are big [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6795.88s)]
*  I'm with you close. It should be tonight like Olivera versus our Arman Sarukian [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6802.44s)]
*  I feel like Olivera almost had him a couple times and what he had [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6807.92s)]
*  What did he have been a Darce and was arse guillotine? [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6812.92s)]
*  If you have something cinched up and that's a lot you know the shame of a [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6816.360000000001s)]
*  Yes [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6820.84s)]
*  I should have been five rounds. That's five rounds Charles probably wins that you but yeah, I think so too [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6822.88s)]
*  Maybe I mean who knows but he would have a better chance [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6827.52s)]
*  But if you count like near submissions as like much more point get no credit [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6830.200000000001s)]
*  You don't get credit like you do if you rock a guy [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6836.0s)]
*  But it is it's it's you're close to finishing a fight [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6837.8s)]
*  But did it to that same point like with Alex Pierre defending 12 takedowns 12 for 12 [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6841.18s)]
*  You get no fucking credit right guy attempted 12 takedowns. You couldn't do it [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6845.9800000000005s)]
*  That guy gets no who should get credit the guy defend the takedown. No [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6850.700000000001s)]
*  You don't get credit you get credit for like not getting hit [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6855.3s)]
*  Well, you get a little bit a little bit a little bit [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6859.06s)]
*  I don't think you should get credit for defense the big credit is the submission attempts. Yeah [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6861.860000000001s)]
*  I'll bet you get this offense not defense. He's going to it again [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6866.3s)]
*  Can you imagine you get points for escaping an arm bar like that would be retarded? That'd be dope [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6870.22s)]
*  See, this is interesting right because Kevin was doing a lot of damage at the end of the first [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6876.02s)]
*  But a lot of it was on the back and then here you got gunner takes him down [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6881.02s)]
*  After unsuccessfully taking him down for like three minutes and he's doing something he's on top [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6886.22s)]
*  Right, but no nothing's happening [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6892.3s)]
*  Yeah, you're gonna take down yeah that one's you know, I'm saying like nothing's happening [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6895.5s)]
*  She's not getting any damage heaven didn't do anything true. Yeah, so so in that situation [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6899.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah happen. He took you give it to gunner for sure. Yeah, but it's not as good as like a guy rocking you [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6903.9s)]
*  I know right [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6911.18s)]
*  Exactly. There's a difference. I think the whole score system is fucked [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6912.9s)]
*  Both those rounds are not ten nines the second rounds at 10 9 first round. How is that at 10? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6916.62s)]
*  I he almost not come on should barely survive [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6922.02s)]
*  They should be a little bit of stocked right at the end saved by the bell like box [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6924.58s)]
*  How is that night when a guy gets dropped? It's automatically a 10-8. Yes. Yeah, I guys in trouble [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6927.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a good move [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6932.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, when a guy gets dropped, but then you got you know fights [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6934.74s)]
*  Like where a guy gets dropped and gets up and drops the other guy like, you know, evens out. Yeah [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6937.900000000001s)]
*  I guess I think even rounds are okay [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6943.22s)]
*  More comprehensive scoring system. Yes, I think the whole 10 9 is crazy because we just took it from boxing and we're like, okay [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6946.62s)]
*  That's a established point system for fighting but you're using it with something that has all these different elements take down submission [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6952.700000000001s)]
*  octagon control [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6960.58s)]
*  There's so many more [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6962.1s)]
*  Factors and then you look at the people scoring it these judges half of them don't know what the fuck they're looking at [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6964.42s)]
*  Moreno and her sake that ursa guy almost beat Pento [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6970.06s)]
*  That's uh, we we're doing EBI in Mexico City the next day [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6973.660000000001s)]
*  Oh Saturday next day EBI 23 the featherweights with strikes. We're bringing back strikes in EBI [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6976.9800000000005s)]
*  Hell yeah strikes or there's enough so only just you like combat jiu-jitsu. So slaps [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6984.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad you didn't you could punch it was born in EBI [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6988.900000000001s)]
*  Can you punch the body you could punch to the you could strike to the body just you could strike anywhere punch not punch [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6991.38s)]
*  The body yeah boss room style. Yeah as next Sunday guys UFC fight practicing their body strikes [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=6997.8s)]
*  Are they like working on that? Oh Jesus they should [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7005.08s)]
*  Kevin's so dangerous the clay he's hitting him with a hard body shots man the clay. Oh elbow over the top. Oh knee [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7010.320000000001s)]
*  Kevin's got to go for broke [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7020.12s)]
*  Because he probably won the first round. I think he won the first round for sure [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7021.92s)]
*  Second round no [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7025.580000000001s)]
*  So this is it and Kevin needs to win. He's landing some uppercuts. Oh Gunners in deep Gunners in deep [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7027.34s)]
*  Oh, he's out of it [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7033.820000000001s)]
*  His hands locked anymore on the body [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7037.1s)]
*  We got him. He's just trying to get out of the cage. You got him full mount full mount. Oh shit. Here it is [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7040.46s)]
*  Kevin's in trouble [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7046.620000000001s)]
*  Gonna announce him full mount third third round grapevine in the legs [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7048.1s)]
*  He rushed in the back taking the first round though should take his time from here [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7052.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he's got time his feet off the fact that he's not feet off the cage [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7055.18s)]
*  The fact that he's not digging for underhooks right now. Yeah, it's kind of scary [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7059.56s)]
*  He should took his feet off like like why why won't you immediately go for the underhook? [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7063.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's like what was your plan in the mount? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7068.18s)]
*  There hurts at least take his feet off the cage. That's what got him out [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7071.9s)]
*  You shouldn't be not supposed to dig your toes in the face Gordon Gordon if you were in the mount right there [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7075.42s)]
*  You would immediately grab the underhook and under jacked to like an arm triangle, right? Yeah underhook underhook [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7080.22s)]
*  Well, the first thing is to circle his feet off the cage because that gives him you're saying circle him to the center of the octagon [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7085.42s)]
*  Yes, because the bridge off the cage just gives you a men's correct totally but but besides that that an underhook that an under [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7091.3s)]
*  Jack arm triangle. Yeah, right. Oh [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7097.820000000001s)]
*  Damn look at that. He's gonna come out. He should really not Jack Ray out from the bottom. Yep from guard [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7104.06s)]
*  How about Hanzo on Oleg talk? Oh, yeah [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7110.22s)]
*  Kick those the first time we saw like an effective up kick. Yeah, and then Jerry Bolander on [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7113.62s)]
*  He's gonna pass him here. No, uh, no real. I'm a son. I'm on time or Fabio. Giorgio. I'm passing him [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7119.06s)]
*  He's got the back. He's got one hook. I [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7124.38s)]
*  Think there's probably like 10. Oh, there it is triangle. There it is [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7127.62s)]
*  Kevin's left hip he's got a mount him just [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7132.42s)]
*  He's got his left knee across [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7135.38s)]
*  Hit and they not my enough pressure [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7138.38s)]
*  Within half guard from half guard [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7140.82s)]
*  It depends if he has a good lockdown or not if he had a good lockdown he would survive [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7142.74s)]
*  But he just got it why he's not passing the guard here. I'm not sure [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7146.66s)]
*  It's also hard for him to dismount from here because the cage is in the way [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7150.42s)]
*  He's got even if he does there it is. There comes the mount here it comes [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7154.42s)]
*  Okay, so now he's gonna try to either mount him or slice eye control [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7157.42s)]
*  But he's kind of like he's kind of wedged in place by the cage [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7161.06s)]
*  You should be there it is here it goes here it comes. He's probably just he probably knows what's up. He's just [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7164.160000000001s)]
*  waiting till [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7171.04s)]
*  Catches his breath. Oh should not take the back [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7173.08s)]
*  Nice by Kevin [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7177.4800000000005s)]
*  That's why you got a mount [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7179.4800000000005s)]
*  Gunner should have switched back to a tight waist when Kevin went to roll out should break free here [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7181.4800000000005s)]
*  She break free here and start eating off on him [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7185.400000000001s)]
*  Gunner held on to the trying arm triangle too long [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7188.88s)]
*  He should have mounted in my in my opinion like like all arm triangles in my opinion should be in the mount once you start [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7191.900000000001s)]
*  Going side control. There's too many escapes that scapes are too easy [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7198.36s)]
*  Well, you should have at least set it better for mount like it wasn't set like you should have mounted him [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7201.12s)]
*  Kevin's gonna come at him hard here. Yeah, he's got to [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7209.32s)]
*  She can't get taken down. Oh [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7213.08s)]
*  Damn, this is gonna be a hard one to score [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7216.04s)]
*  super hard to score [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7219.08s)]
*  Don't try to go for a Darce looks like it looked like you thought about it [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7222.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's looking for it for sure [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7227.48s)]
*  Disengage Kevin. I know right especially now. He's got his hands locked [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7230.679999999999s)]
*  And [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7236.68s)]
*  He had times to disengage and he's got an advantage in the striking huge advantage [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7239.8s)]
*  But also like so exhausted at this point in the fight [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7245.24s)]
*  Yeah, he's probably turning arrest [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7248.88s)]
*  Total strikes Kevin 130 gunner 20 [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7254.28s)]
*  Gunners gonna win it you think less can't have Kevin catches him three seconds to go [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7261.0s)]
*  so [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7266.28s)]
*  Ten nine ten nine gunner, but then ten eight in the first round. What is that a draw? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7268.28s)]
*  You do ten nine Holland first round. There's gonna be a draw ten nine if they gave him ten eight for the first round [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7274.12s)]
*  No, I agree, but the judges agree the judges are goofy [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7283.12s)]
*  Judges are goofy. It all depends. It depends. I don't think they had a ten eights enough [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7288.4400000000005s)]

*  Amazing genetics super explosive and fast but like very disciplined gets better every fight crazy cardio at 170 [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7474.32s)]
*  Being that muscle bound that muscle bound, but it's his work ethic man [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7483.48s)]
*  He's got crazy work ethic, you know and just that video he made for balala [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7487.0s)]
*  No, it's like he was like explaining like you got what I want like is this whole thing talking about his life what he needs [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7491.08s)]
*  Take care of his grandmother like he was like intense. Yeah, he's like I'm coming for you boy [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7497.1s)]

*  Remember when he fought Ryan Hall, no one knew who he was. Oh, yeah, you know, he smashed him duck [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7513.96s)]
*  Like 80% [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7525.32s)]
*  85% of UFC fighters [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7528.16s)]
*  Aren't ready for the high high level leg locks, right? That's that Brian Hall came in. He just leg lock dudes [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7530.76s)]
*  Yeah, I'm quite right cuz cuz MMA fighters aren't really [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7537.2s)]
*  Training focused on it. They're not focused on jujitsu even at the high level [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7540.84s)]
*  But then but let's see in Ryan Hall was he ripped through some people with leg locks, but then BJ. Yeah, which is crazy [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7545.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but then he hits Topperia. How do you say Topperia? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7551.48s)]
*  Ilya that was the first guy like oh shit. This guy knows how to defend like who is he? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7555.72s)]
*  Who's his coach? He's got a not sure [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7560.96s)]
*  his famous guy [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7564.32s)]
*  Ilya yes, he's been he was working with [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7566.36s)]
*  someone legit [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7569.88s)]
*  Maybe it was like balance studios or something. I don't know but [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7571.4s)]
*  That was a sometimes you're gonna run into guys that you cannot leg lock and when it's all greasy [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7575.679999999999s)]
*  But also you get to a certain level where guys can stop your game at leg lots [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7582.04s)]
*  And if you don't have striking you get exposed. It's why I'm gonna find it was well versed in [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7587.46s)]
*  Poria how do you say to go to poria to poria Ryan Hall's had like nine surgeries? [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7592.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah over the last like maybe more didn't yeah, Josh wait is 23 is what I looked up. That's nuts [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7597.84s)]
*  He's not that active. I know he's turned down a lot of matchups to what is he getting surgery on? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7603.88s)]
*  That's 23 does he still fight having problems [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7608.52s)]
*  Ryan Hall still fighting still under contract, but I know he's turned down a bunch of fights. Yeah [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7611.56s)]
*  man [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7616.12s)]
*  I like it. I like it. I don't general anesthesia. She's put out 19 times that can't be good for you [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7618.12s)]
*  You got put put to sleep 19 times 19 general anesthesia surgeries some procedures need to be redone due to complications [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7624.8s)]
*  Jesus Christ, holy fuck man. What what is what is his injuries? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7632.68s)]
*  21 general anesthesia surgery since that fight. I'm not sorry 19. They were two prior. That's crazy. What happened to him? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7637.64s)]
*  I don't they kept having issues [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7645.12s)]
*  So at 21 general anesthesia surgeries [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7647.599999999999s)]
*  I got fallen on tore my ACL had to fix a planter plate got fallen on again had to have a tightrope surgery on [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7650.04s)]
*  That one that Pat Mahone's and a couple other people have had ACL got infected a couple of septic arthritis [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7657.64s)]
*  Tightrope was actually allergic to the hardware. They put in me somewhere somehow [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7664.88s)]
*  Had to have that redone. It's been interesting but back on the end of it [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7670.24s)]
*  On the back end of it rather Wow [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7675.28s)]
*  That's crazy [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7677.88s)]
*  Boy, wow, it's a shame no idea. That's so many surgeries. I thought he retired [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7679.36s)]
*  That's crazy. How many surgeries have you had? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7685.2s)]
*  One just one. Yeah my LCL. I've been injured a lot, but just one surgery. Yeah, was that from a leg lock? [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7688.44s)]
*  Any communes? No [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7695.0s)]
*  Eddie broke my ankles a bunch of times but uh, I was when I competed against you out Rocha [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7697.04s)]
*  Was going for a leg lock entry and he was like 270. That's right jump towards my head. What happened Eddie, dude? [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7701.7s)]
*  I don't know. He just like disappeared one day and then apparently he was like training like pretty recently at Enzo's and unity [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7707.74s)]
*  But he just like stopped training jitsu forever got a real job [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7715.26s)]
*  I think and then that guy was vicious man. So good. So smart. I was I was [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7719.6s)]
*  Standing over him as he ripped through everybody with leg locks my god [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7726.0s)]
*  Damn he was on he was on some other shit. You know what I mean? He was vicious and then you hear from [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7729.98s)]
*  His training partners that man he he went hard right in the training room. He went after legs. They get they dig it hard. Yeah [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7737.34s)]
*  It's weird when guys would get that good and just stop [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7746.099999999999s)]
*  When after he retired he still put out a couple like videos a little short instructionals on Instagram and [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7749.74s)]
*  This one he put out for the z-lock that to me is the best like in my opinion the z-lock the one he showed [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7757.179999999999s)]
*  That's the best. It's not a sad story if you want to do something cool that he's want to do [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7764.3s)]
*  It's kind of dope days like fuck it. I'm over it if he went on to make money. He's doing well, you know, yeah [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7768.34s)]
*  Depends what he's doing. What do you think is the best leg lock one leg lock? [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7773.94s)]
*  You're gonna teach your students just one leg lock entry and one [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7777.62s)]
*  Heel hook what's it gonna be? [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7782.5s)]
*  Well, and so far as breaking mechanics or no like they say they got the breaking mechanics down and just which where's where you're the legs gonna [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7785.5s)]
*  Be which leg entanglement are you gonna choose? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7793.34s)]
*  Which one's the best? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7796.5s)]
*  Obviously, it's not DOA. It's not outside. Ah, she [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7798.06s)]
*  And not just regular ah, she either that one's no basic [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7802.22s)]
*  backside 5050 is pretty good [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7807.42s)]
*  Right when you go go because I hear from backside 5050 coming in from kegar right? Yeah, I hear like from my guys [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7810.42s)]
*  I'm not like the biggest leg locker [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7817.58s)]
*  But I pay attention to my guys and they're saying that the entry into backside 5050 is awesome [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7818.74s)]
*  But you don't really generally get the tap there [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7824.66s)]
*  There's gonna be some kind of scramble and some kind of you can but the guy can [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7827.86s)]
*  High-leg over if you trap the far leg the secondary leg then you can get finishes belly down with it [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7831.5s)]
*  Which is why it's a good position but the good guy is always gonna is always gonna limp leg and strip the grip [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7836.38s)]
*  Which is why I believe that probably the best position [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7841.860000000001s)]
*  In terms of not having a guy come forward and crush you or hit you and strong catastrophic breaking mechanics is probably [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7846.66s)]
*  Across ashi-garami your guys's honey hole. So that's still the best [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7854.02s)]
*  Double trouble. Yeah, so you feel you feed the one leg across the legs are split [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7858.26s)]
*  So you have Achilles lock here and I think for the heel and then you go in okay and lock up [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7862.04s)]
*  It's still the best. Um, but my highest percentage finish [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7867.04s)]
*  is [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7870.64s)]
*  That position but with the leg fit on the outside for the outside heel hook. That's like z lock ish, right? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7872.24s)]
*  Yeah, kind of yeah says cuz z lock is basically double trouble with the outside heel hook correct and and instead of [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7877.8s)]
*  Triangling your legs [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7884.8s)]
*  Stomping on the inside. Yeah, you can go foot to foot. What is that what you guys call it foot to foot? Yeah, that's you [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7886.32s)]
*  That's like yeah game changer right there and that right there [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7890.64s)]
*  Just a straight ankle lock is the most powerful straight ankle lock from that position right there with it with it on the outside [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7893.76s)]
*  Oh, no, the secondary leg. Yeah, that's straight ankle lock and the aoki. Yeah, he's strong as well [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7898.88s)]
*  How crazy are you a okies a okies are a lot like dead orchards where in the what the first time I seen a aoki [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7904.68s)]
*  Is it's from Shinya aoki it seemed like he was going for just a straight ankle lock [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7911.0s)]
*  But dude I forget his opponent was but his his foot almost slipped out [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7916.5s)]
*  So it was a straight it looked like a straight ankle lock that he almost pulled his foot out [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7921.12s)]
*  But it got caught and twisted. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and everyone thought maybe not everyone but I thought oh, that's one of those [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7924.54s)]
*  You know freak things that you don't actually plan for it or set up for it [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7931.38s)]
*  It just happens sometimes they pull out of ankle locks and sometimes like [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7935.58s)]
*  An omoplata sometimes when they try to pull out their own with omoplata it gets caught and they tap an arm bar [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7940.18s)]
*  It's not like you set it up. It's like a freak thing [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7945.24s)]
*  They try to get out, but it got caught and then they tap [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7948.4s)]
*  So that's what I thought the aoki was but it turns out fuck no [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7950.599999999999s)]
*  That's it seems like the aoki is top two leg lock finishes in the grappling world today [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7954.8s)]
*  It's just people get because it's so good to counter with them, correct? Yeah [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7961.28s)]
*  No, you get you get you get good finishes with aoki's what's an okie? [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7965.2s)]
*  It's an ankle lock, but when they slip their their their their heel out [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7968.5599999999995s)]
*  It's still like it's like you're going for an ankle lock and they almost pull out the leg and then it turns into a heel [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7972.34s)]
*  Hook so it's half ankle lock half heel hook huge. It's like the most powerful shit [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7976.38s)]
*  It's not mechanically as strong as a heel hook though [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7980.78s)]
*  Because when you go for your hooks, you're physically bridging your hip into the knee [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7982.92s)]
*  Yeah, whereas with Ioke's the knee is turned out. So you're bridging you're not bridging into the knee in a way to break it [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7986.08s)]
*  Yeah, whereas what's like an inverted heel hook? For example, you have a good strong connection [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7991.42s)]
*  You have a good strong connection, but when you go to bridge you see like you see how you see [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=7997.16s)]
*  You say he's not bridging into the hip. Yeah, so with a heel hook you're bridging directly into the hip [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8001.84s)]
*  So it's the it's a full extension of your body into the knee [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8006.54s)]
*  So the upper leg is pinned through the leg position and then your dripping position is what's manipulating the foot [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8010.139999999999s)]
*  And scroll down a little bit Jamie and look at the guy on the [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8016.2s)]
*  That one on the right the one you had the big one on the right that now we can't see it on the right [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8018.92s)]
*  That one right there. Can you blow that up? [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8023.4s)]
*  And the dude doing the aoke lock his right leg the way I think people are calling that a shadow hook or whatever [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8025.4s)]
*  Silverado he's a catch wrestler Brazilian catch wrestler showed me that when I was a white belt [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8033.16s)]
*  I remember straight ankle remember he used to do that. Yeah, he used to do that and I thought like oh this thing [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8038.2s)]
*  This is nothing. So I always I never really fucked with it. But now it's back [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8042.92s)]
*  Strong like Helena Crevara is doing this exact thing. This is like her main [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8048.36s)]
*  Move Silverado had a lot of Jean LeBelle stuff. Yeah, it was a catch wrestling thing. There's a lot of that [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8053.0s)]
*  this is a great position because [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8057.8s)]
*  Like with the guy who's attacking his right leg. Usually the guy's trying to peel it off the hip [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8059.8s)]
*  Yeah, so when you peel it off the hip that butterfly hook comes in and then normally you would throw that left leg [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8064.92s)]
*  Over so now you can't step over the you can't disengage the legs as easy and [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8071.72s)]
*  Dude putting his right leg there if he put it traditionally you'd put it on the hip [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8076.2s)]
*  That you could get countered with a hooks or a naoki. Yeah, so that's huge like a regular ashi [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8080.36s)]
*  Everyone's like I got guys that just let dudes put them in ashi so they could take that foot and and it's a whole it's [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8084.36s)]
*  A game changer and also because the right foot is on the inside position. It makes it hard for the guy in defense [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8090.68s)]
*  The defensive guy. Yeah to push forward into you [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8096.52s)]
*  It makes it hard for him to come forward because the ioki you have to push into the lock [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8099.88s)]
*  You put your foot deeper to boot it [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8103.32s)]
*  The butterfly actually stops you from pushing the foot in deeper. Yeah the guy who uh [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8105.88s)]
*  There was I don't know. I think the first guy to really really master it was um, the polish guy. So what? [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8111.4s)]
*  What's his name? Uh, you find he's he he armbarred gary tonin that guy. What's his name? Matias? [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8116.84s)]
*  Shazinsky. Yeah, yeah, but shazinsky that guy. Um, yeah, everyone talks about him. I've never trained with him [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8123.08s)]
*  He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8128.28s)]
*  Um, yeah, everyone talks about him. I've never trained with him, but apparently he was like he was [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8133.08s)]
*  He just been breaking everybody exactly so it was and he was doing his legs just like that [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8137.72s)]
*  You know, it was aoki with that leg entanglement. We were calling it the polish aoki [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8142.52s)]
*  You know and uh, he's a bad motherfucker. Well, it's difficult because the butterfly doesn't allow you to stack [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8147.72s)]
*  He doesn't allow you to come forward and push your foot deeper [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8152.92s)]
*  I'd never forget silverado showing me that as a wipeout and i'm thinking really [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8155.88s)]
*  It ken shamrock puts his leg up here. Why would you do that? [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8160.36s)]
*  I was like learning shit off ken shamrock [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8165.32s)]
*  I learned I got into toe holes as a wipeout because ken shamrock had this instructional where he's in [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8167.8s)]
*  Jeans and no shirt. He's all tanned and yolk [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8173.88s)]
*  He looked like a chippendales guy and he's with some japanese guy [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8177.96s)]
*  And then he's going over toe holes like standing over a guy's guard and grabbing the foot and doing a toe hold [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8180.84s)]
*  I'm like, whoa, what is he doing with the foot and I could never get on top of anybody [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8186.76s)]
*  I was always I pulled i'm i've taken down one person my whole life and that was in wrestling. I had one wrestling takedown [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8191.400000000001s)]
*  I had one wrestle. I wrestled two years got one takedown because I was afraid to break my teeth [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8198.92s)]
*  Everyone's missing teeth. I didn't want to shoot. I go you shooting all sprawl. I'm like you shoot all sprawl [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8204.12s)]
*  I got a good front headlock now. I got a good front headlock, but I can't have zero takedowns unless [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8209.08s)]
*  It's a dude that doesn't wrestle like when I would I got in a couple street fights here [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8215.16s)]
*  And I was never I was always a pussy growing up [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8219.08s)]
*  I was never a tough guy [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8221.16s)]
*  But every now and then you know, I wrestled and I never looked at wrestling as a martial art [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8222.28s)]
*  I looked at his pussy fighting. I go dude. I'm not a fighter. No one thinks i'm a fighter [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8227.08s)]
*  I don't have a reputation to uphold but if anybody fucks with me [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8230.68s)]
*  I'm gonna double leg them and just hold them until the principal breaks us up [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8233.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? I was like dude. I was grounded and pounding in ninth grade [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8237.4s)]
*  I would take dudes out. I fought this one soccer player his name was sesad [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8241.64s)]
*  He was talking a lot of shit and I go dude [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8245.4s)]
*  He'll probably kick my ass [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8247.08s)]
*  But he can't stop my takedown because this dude don't wrestle so I take him down and I would just like [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8248.04s)]
*  Get side control and like barely punch his stomach and wait for someone to pull me off [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8252.52s)]
*  I made I survived [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8257.64s)]
*  And then when I saw hoist fighting ufc2 i'm like you could fight on the ground and not be a pussy [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8259.24s)]
*  That's why I joined jujitsu. I'm like, oh my god. This is my shit. I thought fighting on the ground was pussy fighting [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8264.92s)]
*  Like it's it's accepted and respected and that's okay [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8270.199999999999s)]
*  That's that's what got me into jujitsu [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=8274.039999999999s)]

*  You know, that's he really is he moves like connor. He's got that kind of style [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9038.679999999998s)]
*  But and that style like cardio wise like getting the third round you're so explosive [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9043.24s)]
*  You just can't run at that high gear for exactly it's so [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9047.0s)]
*  Fast twitch based. Yep [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9050.84s)]
*  It's not a good style for longevity unless you're real sparing with your attacks and you have to have complete control [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9052.6s)]
*  So if a guy mauls you and just comes at you with a lot of combinations and hits you with a pace [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9059.16s)]
*  Yeah, you're kind of sorry. Yeah, they catch up here. You get a grappler can avoid the big shots [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9063.64s)]
*  Then the third round you're fucked and obviously that weight class is filled with talent there's so much talent there [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9068.279999999999s)]
*  I was discussing with guy. I won't say who it is. He's coming back to ufc and his buddy's like [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9074.68s)]
*  He's like man. What matchup do you think he's like we just need to give him an easy matchup for his first one [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9079.96s)]
*  I'm like buddy. It's 20 25 in the ufc. There's no cake walks. Yeah, there used to be cake walks [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9084.44s)]
*  There was guys like thank god they gave me him. There's really not that [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9090.039999999999s)]
*  With the contender series like this it's just full of these young fucking lions [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9093.64s)]
*  Yeah, the guys that zero fights in the ufc are super fucking dangerous. That's what's crazy [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9097.64s)]
*  Zero fights and they come in at a world-class level and they're like well rounded everything especially these motherfuckers from russia [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9103.48s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many daggistan guys that are coming in and like good lord. They're so dangerous. There's no gimme fights anymore. No [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9110.36s)]
*  No [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9118.28s)]
*  Oberg seems to be out pointing him here a little more active. Yeah, like right there definitely still speed advantage. Mm-hmm [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9120.76s)]
*  And yawn hasn't landed any big shots to the head like the big one [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9128.6s)]
*  That's gonna really change the course of the fight. No, he looks a little slower [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9132.36s)]
*  But he's just dealing with a very tall fast, dude [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9136.52s)]
*  It's gonna get weird for yawn. He loses this one. You're off two years [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9139.800000000001s)]
*  The division the state it's in it's tough, man [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9144.52s)]
*  Well, we'll see there's still three minutes fucking crazy is mma it's like alka volknowski [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9149.08s)]
*  Before he lost those two he was like there's arguing. He's the pound for pound number one [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9153.560000000001s)]
*  He was on the like number two and then three months later. He's not even on the list. Yep, neon edwards [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9158.36s)]
*  Yep, before he lost balal was I think number five pound for pound now. He's not not even on the list crazy [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9163.960000000001s)]
*  This one you're kind of fucked [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9169.560000000001s)]
*  mma is wild man [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9171.720000000001s)]
*  Yawn with another good strong low kick [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9173.640000000001s)]
*  But he needs more than that he needs some head shots [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9176.359999999999s)]
*  He needs to get the judge's attention [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9180.279999999999s)]
*  I wonder what the live odds are right now olberg for sure gotta be olberg, right? [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9183.32s)]
*  Just from a volume perspective, yeah, just active [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9190.84s)]
*  He looks like he's gonna spin that was close he's heavily bladed [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9198.279999999999s)]
*  Good left hook right hand. We're starting to sit down on sponges now [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9206.039999999999s)]
*  Is it interesting [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9210.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah 160 but still olberg's favorite [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9214.359999999999s)]
*  It's just yawn is having a hard time connecting [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9221.8s)]
*  And olberg's not an issue. He's not slowing down. Olberg's done such a much better job of pacing himself now [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9225.0s)]
*  And obviously he's in better condition too. Yes, and his distance like look he's never stopped hopping around [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9230.68s)]
*  It's fucking tough. Take two years off. Then you jump in with a killer's ranked number six, man. It's not easy [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9235.88s)]
*  Especially a young dude all hungry beyond still trying to it's like gutter nelson taking two years off and jumping back in [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9242.119999999999s)]
*  It's fucking tough, man [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9248.199999999999s)]
*  Good kick, it's the uh, shawn brady's favored [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9253.0s)]
*  Is he yeah shawn brady's favorite over four and a half rounds is also favored. Yes interesting [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9255.64s)]
*  Yes, this card has the potential to be you know [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9260.68s)]
*  If you're looking for knockouts, this might not be the one card for you [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9263.56s)]
*  It's tough for brady to stop leon [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9270.36s)]
*  Yeah [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9272.68s)]
*  Very tough. It's gonna be interesting to see how he fares on the feet because leon's such a technician on the feet [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9273.8s)]
*  He's such a sniper [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9280.2s)]
*  But he's also going to be super wary about the takedown [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9281.72s)]
*  But he's been trying to take people down to kind of like prove a point like he did with kamaru [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9283.8s)]
*  Yeah, I hope he doesn't try to do that with shawn bad idea [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9288.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different level and brady just [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9293.0s)]
*  It's just like in the fifth round you look at that gilbert fight [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9295.48s)]
*  It's like he had more takedowns in the fifth round like his cardio is insane. Yeah, he's very fit [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9298.44s)]
*  Olberg seems to be walking away from it [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9306.28s)]
*  Olberg ain't getting a title shot after this one though. No [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9310.52s)]
*  But it puts him in the top for sure. He yeah top five [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9314.36s)]
*  He just hasn't done anything like [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9319.56s)]
*  Real spectacular [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9321.88s)]
*  Olberg is the wearer of round tree and um [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9323.96s)]
*  Jamal hill would be fun [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9327.08s)]
*  John's still pushing though, man. He's going after him good low kicks. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh he clipped him with that left hand [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9329.16s)]
*  Yeah, yawn can't get his range [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9336.76s)]
*  Hmm good fight a solid fight [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9340.359999999999s)]
*  There's she on each other fucking warriors [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9344.92s)]
*  Fucking guys being guys. Yeah, just a couple of bros a couple bros [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9348.84s)]
*  Just fighting shadow at each other. Yeah, I think over probably got that decision. Yeah slight decision [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9354.52s)]
*  I'm very interested to see how shawn deals with the stand-up [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9359.560000000001s)]
*  You know because shawn stand-up has come a long way [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9363.800000000001s)]
*  But there's levels big big difference. Yeah, he's got then there's a big difference on the feet too, right? [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9366.36s)]
*  So it's all about who and and will their will right? Right? [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9371.560000000001s)]
*  Well, if if shawn can get him down early like balal did it would be a big thing and balal set the blueprint [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9375.64s)]
*  Yeah, constant pressure. Yep, but I do think you have to take into consideration the fact that that was a 5 a.m [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9381.8s)]
*  Fight, which is just nuts [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9387.0s)]
*  I mean it sucks, but this but your pros I know but like you gotta go man [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9389.4s)]
*  How crazy is that like everybody in the audience has been drunk since two in the morning. They're like [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9393.8s)]
*  It's tough [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9398.68s)]
*  They're all exhausted. They're fucking filled with beer, you know [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9399.8s)]
*  There's people sleeping they were sleeping. Yeah, they were sleeping. It was so [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9404.279999999999s)]
*  They must be so exhausted [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9408.84s)]
*  I can't imagine going to see a fight that that's the main event starts at five in the morning [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9410.68s)]
*  I think the main event was like six in the morning. Yeah, that's that's rough. It's ridiculous. It's terrible [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9415.24s)]
*  Why don't just do it this way? Just have the fights on early [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9420.199999999999s)]
*  You know that was a pay-per-view, right? [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9423.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's why yeah, but still have a pay-per-view three in the afternoon. Who cares? I prefer it. Yeah, who cares? [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9425.96s)]
*  My nights Saturday. Yeah, it's Saturday people will still buy it. They watch football in the day true [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9431.96s)]
*  Why wouldn't they watch a big fight during the day? Just let them know in advance. It's 3 p.m. Start [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9436.759999999998s)]
*  The only one who complained is Tom Aspinall [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9441.96s)]
*  29 28 [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9449.699999999999s)]
*  Carlos [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9452.199999999999s)]
*  Yep. Yep. Yeah, it's gonna get dicey for you on them. Good decision. Yeah hard hard road for him. Yeah sports, you know [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9453.96s)]
*  I mean [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9462.679999999998s)]
*  two years off [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9463.88s)]
*  Not really a tune-up fight tough fight. There's no tune-up fights. There's that that's what i'm saying the ufc [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9465.4s)]
*  There's there's not much they can do for you anymore. That's what's crazy because boxing I think has it right [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9470.599999999999s)]
*  When a guy hasn't been fighting for a while give him some fucking shake off the dust. Yeah, you don't know number 30 guy [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9474.839999999998s)]
*  Right out of tijuana. Yeah pop up the ufc doesn't have that. Yeah, I know ready to go [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9480.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and they don't have managers that like set their fighter up for victory either like on the under cards like now you're gonna face a brawler [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9485.48s)]
*  Now you're gonna face a short guy. Oh bobs and wheeze now. You're gonna face a tall guy [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9493.64s)]
*  Yeah, they you know, they by the time a guy gets to a championship level in boxing. They've been tried and tested. It's very systematic [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9498.039999999999s)]
*  Yes, he's not like that. I know [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9505.16s)]
*  Did you see the lamont roach? [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9507.96s)]
*  Lamont roach javante davis fight. Yes. Oh, I had lamont roach didn't you? Yeah [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9510.039999999999s)]
*  Well, especially with that knockdown. Yeah, that's a real lockdown. Wow. You take a knee. That's a 10-8 round [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9516.119999999999s)]
*  And javante is and I had something in my eye. I'm like, I don't give a fuck you took a knee [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9521.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know the rules. That's the rules. That's the rule dim the rules and they didn't have the replay ready [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9525.64s)]
*  So the they didn't look at the box and soak her up, dude [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9530.439999999999s)]
*  That's a little bit [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9534.039999999999s)]
*  But then they get involved in it might help it perhaps [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9536.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9539.64s)]
*  Or, you know, you know can't change the tiger stripes [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9540.92s)]
*  Well, it's gonna you see their pace structure. It's also far way out from getting done because guys are on a contract structure legit though [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9544.92s)]
*  Yeah, was it legit? Yeah, that's the I mean pretty sure it's legit, but that actually helps boxing overall [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9551.72s)]
*  Nice the top dogs aren't gonna eat like they are now with 40 50 million dollar paydays [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9559.0s)]

*  How many times can you do? [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9995.4s)]
*  I usually do like five sets of 20 [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=9997.48s)]
*  But like good 20 pull-ups straight arm straight arm like proper for a big guy [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10000.039999999999s)]
*  Like when you weigh like 250 by 240 something. Jesus christ. That's a lot of weight. I'm so fucking strong right now [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10004.68s)]

*  I wish I was this strong. It's the scorpion venom. It must be look at leon edwards. He looks hyped [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10015.56s)]
*  Here we go, it's the proper time for leon too right now, you know, yeah [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10024.52s)]
*  Yeah [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10030.52s)]
*  Here we go [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10033.480000000001s)]
*  Well, he probably wants revenge after that balal fight, you know, that was a bad fight for him [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10036.36s)]
*  That was a tough night. He just didn't seem into it either right like something was off [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10041.640000000001s)]
*  Well, it's fucking five o'clock in the morning true. I mean how how like how can you fight at your best when you're up all night? [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10045.0s)]
*  But also he's the champ like why wouldn't you set up so the champ's in ideal conditions? [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10052.28s)]
*  I keep like crazy. I get it if balal's a champ coming over there [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10056.52s)]
*  You're like he'll fight in london, but has to be at 5 a.m [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10059.24s)]
*  That makes sense when you're the champ in your hometown. Why the fuck we don't have 5 a.m [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10062.12s)]
*  I don't know the whole thing is crazy the whole just the idea of getting people to fight at that time [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10066.36s)]
*  But there's also a lot of x-factors [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10070.68s)]
*  We don't know behind the scenes like ufc's like first of all tv right deal only time we could do it with the broadcast [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10072.04s)]
*  But how's that only time we get the arena who knows cspm plus they you could just always have it on [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10077.560000000001s)]
*  Anytime but it can't be that easy where ufc just decides [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10082.6s)]
*  I bet there's some other x-factors like it has to be [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10085.48s)]
*  Bias in america are bigger than everywhere else it has to be that and they it has to be the people used to buying it [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10088.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know seven o'clock at night. Yeah [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10093.16s)]
*  It has to be that's the only thing that makes sense [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10095.72s)]

*  I want to see his head looking like a grape. Yeah when he's screaming [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10164.76s)]
*  That's how he's gonna stroke out one day he's gonna be like 80 years old so that's a proper way to go to fuck [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10171.32s)]

*  Adcc 2022 he had like another event that he had to do [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10185.56s)]
*  And like adcc like the scheduling wasn't perfect. So he was a little bit late [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10189.48s)]
*  And uh, I was trying to convince joe to go out i'm like dude just announce me and we fine [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10194.039999999999s)]

*  I'd be terrified to fuck someone's name up. Uh, that's not my cup of tea. Well, he's [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10206.92s)]
*  I know that's your only job [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10215.56s)]
*  Some of those names are fucking hard this like the my biggest anxiety that ufc is getting the names right at the wayans [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10218.279999999999s)]
*  Just like some of them, you know like those under cards when it's like a daggers standing fighter. We're not familiar with [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10224.439999999999s)]
*  It's not happening and I have to have the the people in the in the back [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10229.88s)]

*  How could he not be the whole audience is gonna be for him headshot dead [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10275.4s)]
*  Look at me now [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10279.72s)]
*  Look at me now [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10281.72s)]
*  What a speech that was [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10284.279999999999s)]
*  That was one of the greatest moments ever that head kick in the fifth round losing fight [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10288.76s)]
*  He's losing and john anik with the perfect call [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10292.44s)]
*  Like john anik said that is not the clothes like he could quit right now [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10295.4s)]
*  But that is not the cloth from which he was cut bro [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10298.28s)]
*  Head kick and his coach was like, come on. Come on rocky [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10301.56s)]
*  Don't let him bully your son fuck don't let him bully you wild you ever heard it with the rocky music [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10307.08s)]
*  If you ever feel like you don't want to work out listen to that do that yeah [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10315.72s)]
*  You get fired up here we go [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10320.52s)]
*  So [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10323.08s)]
*  Yeah, he's got no room left [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10326.12s)]
*  Oh, he's gonna be physically leon's gonna be in for a surprise because he's like, oh he's so short [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10330.36s)]
*  I'm like if that happens, but I mean you gotta close that distance of danger with this fucking [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10334.52s)]
*  It's also tough on them because remember he's still spied jdm a straight striker. Mm-hmm, right by jack and then he switch it [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10340.2s)]
*  Well, they gave him some time right? How much time did they give him before they switched it four weeks? That's it. Yeah [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10347.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is different. It's tough again in the ball all fight with sean [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10352.359999999999s)]
*  Did he got beat up? He just got beat up. You couldn't get him down here [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10356.039999999999s)]
*  You couldn't get him down couldn't get him down. But i'll just beat the brakes off him [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10359.64s)]
*  Just defend the takedown fucked his face up [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10362.519999999999s)]
*  Sean looking to put a lot of pressure on just like balal did [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10365.08s)]
*  I mean balal really gave the game plan [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10369.0s)]
*  Oh good. Is your side done? [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10371.8s)]
*  Especially when you're orthodox and you're fighting leon and he's got that powerful left kick that's opened up and he has a breach advantage [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10374.119999999999s)]
*  And he gets that kick to the body a few times. You're not the same [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10381.0s)]
*  left hand of the body [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10384.6s)]
*  Look he's got his distance down. He's got his distance down. This is that philly fade [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10387.48s)]
*  Yeah, this is the distance the difference is the management of the striking distance like leon is so good [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10391.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but he has to be super careful in here. Yeah, because all right there fuck dude counters [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10398.12s)]
*  They're so crisp and they're so there's no fat in them. No wasted movement straight down the pipe [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10403.72s)]
*  If you're afraid he can't go for the takedown too early because he's got it expecting. He's got to open something up [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10410.76s)]
*  Yeah, but he can't stay on the outside [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10415.72s)]
*  You know what the difference is is balal got his respect on the feet and then started laying takedowns [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10417.800000000001s)]
*  If you remember sean just landed a left hook there and now they're in a clinch [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10422.12s)]
*  Because it's gonna be tough to beat leon if you're just straight grappling. Is this interesting that leon's choosing to clinch with him? [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10426.12s)]
*  Nice to need the body by leon [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10432.2s)]
*  That's good. He broke free [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10434.68s)]
*  He is man. I was surprised when he took kamaru down like his grappling is no fucking joke [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10436.2s)]
*  And [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10441.56s)]
*  Remember in the last round he got on top of balala was smashing them with elbows. Remember that? Yep, cut him open [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10443.32s)]
*  Yeah, just a little too little too late [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10449.08s)]
*  But if you if you remember that blow off i've watched a few times below was landing like a motherfucker on the feet [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10451.4s)]
*  Yes, and constant pressure a lot of pressure constant got his respect on the feet and then opened up the takedown [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10456.12s)]
*  Sean's already cut [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10462.12s)]
*  Yes cut on the left eye [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10463.64s)]
*  It's just interesting that leon is allowing the clinch i'm surprised well he's stuffing that underhook [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10471.16s)]
*  Mm-hmm pretty good with that thigh pry. I just would think that oh [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10477.0s)]
*  Oh nice combination. That's what you got to do. You gotta earn the respect and then the takedown would be there [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10481.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's too good. His takedown offense too good just to shoot [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10485.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a nice combination. That's great [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10489.56s)]
*  And this is five rounds son, yes, sir [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10493.08s)]
*  Oh, oh another good combination by sean [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10496.519999999999s)]
*  They usually always have patty on these london cards, but he's on that man miami card same for miami [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10513.24s)]
*  Bro, that's a crazy fight him and chandler so interesting. That should be bananas [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10519.72s)]
*  I love patty. I love chandler, too [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10524.199999999999s)]
*  I'm surprised at how big patty is like when he fought bobby green. I was like he's massive dude [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10526.36s)]
*  He's so big for 55 [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10531.16s)]
*  The ufc that brought him up right they did the right way. Oh leon caught him a left hand there. He did [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10534.84s)]
*  Leon's making it hard in the clinch. Mm-hmm. He's putting that hand super deep in the thigh [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10546.84s)]
*  So brittie's underhook doesn't really have the ability to do anything. Yeah, and those knees to the body are nice [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10551.0s)]
*  There's a nice straight left [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10556.28s)]
*  boat [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10558.12s)]
*  Like britty's got to get him in the clinch and get the underhook and immediately move him around with it [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10559.4s)]
*  Otherwise, he's not gonna make anything happen with it and so far no attempt at all at shooting [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10563.24s)]
*  Like even in these positions, he's not okay now he is [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10570.28s)]
*  This is where strength is gonna be the difference [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10575.96s)]
*  Yeah, let's see if he can do something here [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10578.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because this strength is fucking banana beastly yes, look at the back on that motherfucker. I mean jesus christ [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10585.48s)]
*  It's like he's got a tumor [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10593.64s)]
*  And what is he he's like five seven five ten [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10600.279999999999s)]
*  Five ten no, yeah, he's five ten. Yeah. No. No. Yeah, I think he's five ten. Yeah, uh leon is uh, six two. Yeah [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10603.08s)]
*  Where's sean walk around it [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10615.48s)]
*  He's gotta be 200 plus. Yeah, he's a big fucking boy. Listen at five nine [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10617.4s)]
*  Really? I said five ten in the leon six foot [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10621.640000000001s)]
*  No, that's a ufc five leon's taller than that. I went to sean brady's definitely said six two for leon [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10624.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's seven. Do you sean brady in person's five eight five six four in my basketball programs, too [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10629.96s)]
*  Here goes takedown here we go he's flying no time though very little time very little but at least he's on the round though, don't [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10637.24s)]
*  Depends if you can get off some shots [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10645.88s)]
*  It's definitely it'd be the most action really and he landed on the feet a little more. Mm-hmm. That's probably one round for brady [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10648.679999999998s)]
*  Man i'd like to see that takedown landed earlier to see him set that up, but at least we got [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10655.32s)]
*  A takedown by brady [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10662.6s)]
*  early, too [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10665.08s)]
*  Let's see three to go [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10666.92s)]

*  These guys could just figure out how to trap hands from the back. They'd be so much more effective [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10901.08s)]
*  So he's on gloves on. Oh, look at this. Look at this. He's gonna get up [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10904.36s)]

*  Yeah, because Brady's left knee wasn't controlling leon's right hip so he could have just nothing stopping him from going belly down from there [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10916.76s)]
*  He's gonna try and just like he just gave up. Yeah, he's gonna try and just like [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10926.52s)]

*  That's the only reason to have shorts [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10945.72s)]
*  With tights are so much better because they can't grab you way better leon should be inserting a butterfly hook here and looking to off balance [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10948.68s)]
*  I'm out of that camora with his right foot with his time. He's still got time [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10954.28s)]
*  He has a minute left Brady should be using it to pass. Yeah. Yep [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=10959.24s)]

*  He was he wasn't carrying shawn's body weight, right now. He's this is this is more exhausting than having your back taken [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11015.0s)]
*  Then he's just getting brutalized the whole round. Yeah the whole round exhausted and he came into that round breathing heavy [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11021.320000000002s)]

*  I mean Leon's got a probably stop him or get some 10-8 round. That was a crazy bad [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11407.56s)]
*  And just not a good decision to make against this guy in the round and then he's eaten just [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11413.4s)]
*  hammers [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11420.14s)]

*  Well, he's doing a job stopping the takedowns in the clench. Yes [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11435.82s)]
*  but when he gets [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11439.58s)]
*  When he gets shot on then ran to the cage. Yeah, Dean Thomas in the fucking house loved Dean Thomas. He's awesome [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11441.14s)]
*  if [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11449.66s)]
*  Leon didn't pull off that last second KO against tomorrow [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11454.42s)]
*  You would never think he has a fucking shot but because he's done that we're all like you never know dude [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11457.78s)]
*  Well, you never know start standing and he landed shots in the second and the third. He just got a not let him take him down [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11462.78s)]
*  He looks good though. He doesn't look he's awesome. Yeah, no [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11469.7s)]
*  But even tomorrow didn't beat him up like this. No nor did below. No, I think Sean's on another level now [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11472.46s)]
*  You know, yeah lossy really like you really talked heavily with me about his mental coaching and how much I'm affected had on [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11479.74s)]
*  Oh, did you have him in here? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I forget his his coach [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11485.38s)]
*  Remember his coach his mental coach. Yeah [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11489.9s)]
*  Jamie can't find it cuz that guy's very good. I've watched some of the stuff online. What's the guy's background? [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11492.94s)]
*  You know, I do not Oh good elbow by Sean Oh Sean's teeing him up on the feet now. That's trouble [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11498.5s)]
*  Oh my goodness Sean just can't get oh, there you go. There's a shot good shot [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11504.26s)]
*  What kind of mental coaching did he do? [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11508.02s)]
*  Well, you know, I'd have to have him explain it [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11510.34s)]
*  I don't want to butcher it but it was all about strategies to keep him focused and on track [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11513.34s)]
*  Brian Kane as his mental coach [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11518.66s)]
*  Brian Kane peak performance [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11522.94s)]
*  Affirmation training developing custom affirmations to enforce positive talk build confidence mind control techniques [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11529.26s)]
*  I mean sometimes fighters just need a framework that they keep with them in a fight [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11534.900000000001s)]
*  So if something goes sideways, they can get back on track. Yeah something to get you back to home base [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11539.62s)]
*  Yeah, because sometimes fighters just lose their their train of thought they lose their focus [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11544.12s)]
*  They get into a downward spiral in their head and then they find themselves not completely going for the guillotine [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11549.34s)]
*  Well, especially after this look at this one hand one arm guillotine. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11555.62s)]
*  Oh my goodness, they'll need to mount him. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11562.660000000002s)]
*  He's got to tap. Oh, oh, oh, oh, he's got the hands now. Oh now he's fucked. He's tapped. He tapped Wow [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11569.0s)]
*  Sean fucking Brady [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11577.660000000002s)]
*  Whoo? [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11580.660000000002s)]
*  Holy shit. What a performance dude. Shut out. What a performance. I think shut out [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11582.140000000001s)]
*  Against one of the best of all time in the division [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11588.94s)]
*  former champion [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11592.62s)]
*  Beats his ass and submits him. What are he's asking Dana for here? Wow, that was [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11594.42s)]
*  Impressive, but it makes sense Brady would hire a mental coach of that cuz remember he's undefeated never lost [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11600.58s)]
*  And when you like your ass handed to you like oh fuck. I'm not the end-all-be-all. When is Balal fighting Jack? [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11605.220000000001s)]
*  The two months is that two months yeah, where's that at I [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11611.22s)]
*  Don't know see if Jamie you could find it [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11615.58s)]
*  Fucking unbelievable, man. I'm super impressed. Oh, you have seen 315 May 10th [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11619.5s)]
*  Wow, I won't do that. I don't go to Canada anymore. I [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11625.26s)]
*  Don't know nor should you no discipline. Yeah, I'd rather go to Russia. Yeah, fuck. Yeah [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11629.34s)]
*  When they become the best of all time in the division [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11636.46s)]
*  When they become the US they never know that's never gonna happen [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11640.42s)]
*  That's so crazy to ask them to be a 51st date. I had a conversation with Trump about it [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11644.54s)]
*  He goes I started calling him governor Trudeau just for fun that a lot of people are saying it's a good idea [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11649.74s)]
*  Maybe it is a good idea a lot of people say look at this fucking squeeze man [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11653.98s)]
*  Did you ever work with a mental coach Gordon? I'm pretty mentally fucking strong. No, I believe that confidence is built [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11659.460000000001s)]
*  In the gym training from doing like if you hit an arm bar ten times out of ten times in training [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11666.5s)]
*  You're pretty confident that it's gonna work, but if you don't hit it in training. Why would you be confident? Do you have? [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11672.34s)]
*  Moments in your past where you had a lap lapse of concentration, and then you realized never do that again [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11678.58s)]
*  Yes, like I'm pretty good at like analyzing mistakes [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11686.060000000001s)]
*  And then like fixing them like for you know coming up [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11690.06s)]
*  I would be like super hot and cold like I would beat a lot of guys then I'd have like one like [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11693.019999999999s)]
*  Disastrous match it like purple belt or something or a brown belt [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11697.619999999999s)]
*  and then I was like [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11700.859999999999s)]
*  You know everyone was always like your Tom or you know friends were like how you beat everyone up in the gym? [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11703.42s)]
*  you can't translate it to the mat and [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11709.06s)]
*  I was like, I don't know man. I just I [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11712.42s)]
*  Feel like eventually I'm gonna get like good and then you know be good everywhere [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11715.26s)]
*  and no no one will be able to beat me in any in any position and then kind of just like [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11719.62s)]
*  Going through the reps in the gym and you know got to a point where I was beating everyone from every position [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11724.78s)]
*  So so just you accelerated your skill set so far beyond that you just were so confident that you didn't need to [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11729.48s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean there is there definitely is like the it factor that you can't really like put your finger on like [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11737.34s)]
*  Like most guys even at the highest levels like if you give them the reason to quit they'll quit [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11743.38s)]
*  It's like you can be as technically sound as you want [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11749.06s)]
*  Like even guys who are like super good technically you see a lot of jiu-jitsu who are super good technically [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11753.66s)]
*  If they just get pushed hard and they don't have like success early on they either like crush a guy and like the first five [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11758.3s)]
*  minutes or like [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11764.06s)]
*  Or they lose the match well [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11765.46s)]
*  That's why you like those no time limit fights right like the Felipe fight. Yeah [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11766.859999999999s)]
*  I think I'm a lot stronger mentally than everyone I compete against but also [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11771.08s)]
*  Is a big physical factor because of the fact that when you have like a 30 minute match for example [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11775.800000000001s)]
*  The most important thing is the work rate [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11780.82s)]
*  So if it doesn't matter how good your cardio is like how high your vo2 max is if you're working twice as hard as I am [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11782.92s)]
*  You're gonna get tired faster than I am it's just so [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11789.92s)]
*  Because I'm so much more technical because the gap in skill is so big between being the next best guy [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11793.24s)]
*  Their work rate is always three four or five times as high as mine they have to explode [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11798.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, move quickly doesn't matter how good your cardio is like if I ran a mile it would be impressive [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11802.66s)]
*  But because I'm so much more efficient the work rate is so much higher for my opponents that they just fatigue a lot faster [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11807.3s)]
*  Mmm gangster crazy. Yeah crazy [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11813.3s)]
*  It's it's and it's crazy too that you lay out the blueprint of what to do train 365 days a year constantly study [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11816.34s)]
*  Constantly go over positions constantly drill things constantly improve upon techniques and then you put the techniques out [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11824.64s)]
*  Yeah, you put them out in instructionals and people still can't well [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11831.12s)]
*  So everyone everyone always talks about everybody always talks about hard work [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11834.58s)]
*  But the hardest work is mental work like there's a reason why guys on Wall Street make more money than guys who dig ditches [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11837.48s)]
*  Because they work harder like it's it's not just physical like everyone is [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11842.72s)]
*  Everyone has no problem coming in getting a sweat going home being sore stuff like that [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11847.92s)]
*  But if you ask them to sit down and watch an hour's worth of instruction every night from it [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11852.640000000001s)]
*  Like a Gordon Ryan instructional which you is proven to work in competition. Nobody wants to do that. Can't do it [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11858.32s)]
*  Hmm interesting like you can give them the tools, but they won't build the house [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11863.9s)]
*  Yeah [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11868.32s)]
*  Like all of my like I have like 40 instructionals like hundreds of hours worth of [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11869.44s)]
*  Instructionals that I do and I've referenced matches that I hit this and the exact technique in in competition at world level [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11874.560000000001s)]
*  And just no one's picked up on it. No one not no one at all [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11881.039999999999s)]
*  They kind of just like grab stuff like they see me do [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11884.48s)]
*  Like a move and they kind of just like get the basics of it [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11887.4s)]
*  But no one's really like in-depth studied it and like been able to perform the moves in competition [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11890.56s)]
*  It's like embarrassing for the sport. That's so crazy [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11895.24s)]
*  It's so interesting that the thing that you would need is just a work ethic like everyone's just like oh [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11898.64s)]
*  It's just like a big juice head and I'm just like, okay guys, but this makes my job easier [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11904.56s)]
*  I'm glad that we all are agreeing on this [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11908.560000000001s)]
*  Because it just makes my job so much easier the stuff he's talking about it also is an exciting, you know, right? [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11911.0s)]
*  You know be super disciplined. Yeah, that's the thing but like it like what wins wars is technology and information [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11916.720000000001s)]
*  like [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11924.720000000001s)]
*  Usually the like a country with more technology more access to technology and information is going to be able to win a war [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11925.960000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11931.800000000001s)]
*  It's the same thing for fighting like if you know more most of the time you're gonna be able to to win more like [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11932.48s)]
*  I'm beating these guys because I know more than they do [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11937.64s)]
*  everybody's tough everybody's [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11940.519999999999s)]
*  strong everybody like it's you know, there's [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11943.119999999999s)]
*  Guys are even the best guys in the world. They're super inconsistent like they'll win to they'll lose one. They'll win for they'll lose to [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11946.88s)]
*  But what you know more than everyone in every given position, it's like pretty easy what's going on [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11955.16s)]
*  You were telling me your stomach's getting better now. I can eat a little bit more [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11960.72s)]
*  Like I'm eating like better meals but uh training is training hard [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11965.0s)]
*  It's still tough like whenever my heart rate gets super high and start to get like tired from like a hard session [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11969.0s)]
*  I still get super nauseous. So I can't believe no one has found a solution to that. That's wild [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11973.32s)]
*  Have you run your blood work through chat GPT? Are you done any of that or the strategy? She GPT thing? [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11978.8s)]
*  I gotta do that. You talked to me about that the other day. Yeah [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11984.6s)]
*  But doctors know more about space or we know more about space than we do the stomach like that and my issues in the small [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11988.279999999999s)]
*  intestine which is like the hardest one to treat because [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11994.64s)]
*  Like they can look at your stomach with an endoscopy and they can look at your large intestine intestine with the colonoscopy [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=11997.279999999999s)]
*  But to like figure out what the fuck's going on in your small intestine is like a completely [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12002.8s)]
*  Like they just can't they can't scope it. It's hard. It's crazy that it all comes from antibiotics. Oh [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12006.84s)]
*  Yeah [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12012.92s)]
*  antibiotics [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12014.44s)]
*  Fuck my life up way more than [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12015.84s)]
*  Anything else I've ever done to myself [[03:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12018.52s)]
*  Yeah, but you're not supposed to do them the way you did them, right? You're not supposed to take antibiotics for a year [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12021.28s)]
*  well, so it was like [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12026.2s)]
*  If you get staff and you don't treat it you die spreads and you die [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12028.56s)]
*  Yeah, so it was like I got caught in this like cycle where it was like I got staff [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12032.24s)]
*  I took antibiotics and then I'll be good for two days got staff took antibiotics got staff took antibiotics got staff took [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12036.16s)]
*  So it was just like I'd have like three days of training and then I would just get staff again because [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12043.22s)]
*  Once my stomach started to get affected and my immune system wasn't as strong [[03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12048.22s)]
*  my stomach was trying to my body was trying to fix my stomach and [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12053.46s)]
*  Then I would get staff because my immune system wasn't as strong [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12056.859999999999s)]
*  So then I take antibiotics and then that would destroy my stomach make my immune system weaker and then I get staff again [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12060.46s)]
*  So I just got caught in the cycle and I'm sitting there like I'm not a pussy [[03:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12066.22s)]
*  I'm not gonna stop training [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12069.78s)]
*  So it's just me training the whole time regardless of what was going on [[03:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12070.9s)]
*  Like I would not train when I had to staff [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12074.26s)]
*  But I wasn't gonna like take time off and like try to deal with my stomach [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12076.18s)]
*  I was just like fucking got a key next to him mental toughness can sometimes fuck you up [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12080.44s)]
*  Yeah, give you ever thought about trying like a long fast [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12086.14s)]
*  I mean, I've been forced into like two-week fasts like like like two weeks [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12091.14s)]
*  Yeah, like yeah like pretty much like not eating hardly anything [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12096.26s)]
*  I was actually before I fought Roberto Jim as the one time I called the arm bar [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12100.14s)]
*  I was in the hospital like two days before that getting IVs because I just hadn't eaten in like a week and a half two [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12103.460000000001s)]
*  Weeks was I couldn't eat anything [[03:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12108.54s)]
*  That's crazy [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12111.42s)]
*  So obviously then that's not gonna cure it. No [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12113.5s)]
*  And the problem is is like everything is trial and error. So it's a go try this for eight weeks [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12118.62s)]
*  Fucking eight weeks is a long times and you can try it and you can't like do everything at one time [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12123.06s)]
*  Because then you don't know like like you said like I'm sure I just threw everything at it [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12128.1s)]
*  You know, I know what's actually making me feel good. So it's like you have to add one thing and take away one thing at a time [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12132.94s)]
*  What about your diet? Has anything helped in that we're on? [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12137.82s)]
*  Oh, I couldn't eat I couldn't even eat red meat for a long time [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12140.66s)]
*  Like everyone's was suggesting carnivore, but my stomach just wouldn't digest it [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12143.94s)]
*  like fast food screws me up [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12148.66s)]
*  Steaks sometimes still mess me up spicy food. I can't do like light chicken and rice eggs [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12152.58s)]
*  land crazy fucking disaster crazy [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12158.86s)]
*  You're still able to operate at such a high level with such a giant fucking problem that would really end most people's careers [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12162.02s)]
*  It is what it is [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12168.18s)]
*  Everybody's got their I know but I just can't imagine that with all the resources of the world that someone hasn't reached out just a deli [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12170.02s)]
*  solution [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12176.38s)]
*  Tummyache man, you know, I mean, isn't it kind of crazy that you think that no one [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12178.779999999999s)]
*  There's not one guy out there in Australia or some shit [[03:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12182.939999999999s)]
*  Let's figure it out. I mean that same issue. Yeah. Well, I mean there was one the first time I came on this show [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12186.099999999999s)]
*  A ton of people reached out. I finally found that guy [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12191.619999999999s)]
*  Who like first of all when you go to a normal GI doctor like the guy in California [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12195.82s)]
*  Did test that none of the other GI doctors even know exists and I'm like, I don't know how that's like if you ask me [[03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12202.339999999998s)]
*  Question in jujitsu. It's like XYZ [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12207.46s)]
*  Whereas like you go to one doctor and there's no idea what the other tests were that I got ran on me by another doctor [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12210.14s)]
*  Which is just so insane [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12215.939999999999s)]
*  So there's one guy actually ran tests and he was like, oh all these things are wrong with you [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12217.419999999998s)]
*  And now it's a question of how can we treat them? [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12221.699999999999s)]
*  But like most of the doctors I went to like all the best doctors in the US [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12223.539999999999s)]
*  Just did like an endoscopy like some basic blood work and they're like, oh, you're fine. Like I'm definitely not fine [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12226.82s)]
*  So this other doctor that said this is what's wrong with you. This is how what was his solution? [[03:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12232.779999999999s)]
*  Well, it's just a bunch of things like I mean I could sit here and list for five minutes of things that are wrong with [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12238.26s)]
*  me, but [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12243.78s)]
*  It was like, you know, we're gonna do a lot of holistic stuff like over-the-counter [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12245.38s)]
*  Stuff like like binders to like deal with like mold poisoning talk toxic [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12250.58s)]
*  like [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12256.14s)]
*  issues [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12257.9s)]
*  And then a lot of like probiotics anti like prescription antifungals [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12258.94s)]
*  Like just a combination of stuff like glue to shields like you just drink it and like coats the lining of your esophagus in your [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12263.06s)]
*  In your stomach because my big issue is with a small intestine burr the the food and bile back up into the stomach [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12268.66s)]
*  And it just sits there because it's something there's the small intestines or so that's amazing. Yes [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12276.38s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like you eat food you get full fast and the food just sits in your stomach and just like rots in your [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12281.22s)]
*  Stomach it doesn't filter down [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12287.279999999999s)]
*  It's great fun times [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12290.38s)]
*  It's basically like being seasick 24 7 and what is your thoughts on competing again? [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12293.06s)]
*  Well right now we're just trying to open up this school [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12299.019999999999s)]
*  So I've been trying to open up this damn school for like two years up in North Austin [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12300.939999999999s)]
*  So once I get we're like right at the tail end of getting that open [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12305.38s)]
*  So once that once we get that open and up and running then I'll I'll jump back in if I'm healthy [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12308.5s)]
*  And there's nothing you can do differently than what you're doing now [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12314.34s)]
*  I mean I haven't I do follow-ups with the guy like so for example, it keeps evolving [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12317.06s)]
*  So like they they got that fungal issue they think issue they think under control [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12321.78s)]
*  but [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12327.22s)]
*  Because the fungal the fungal issue in the small intestines now is resolved or mostly resolved they think [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12328.619999999999s)]
*  The lining of the intestines is so inflamed like a scar basically that you have mast cells underneath your [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12335.42s)]
*  underneath your intestinal wall [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12343.14s)]
*  So they're like they're like garbage bags [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12344.66s)]
*  So when the when food or stomach acid leaks through the intestinal wall and hits the mast cells [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12347.220000000001s)]
*  They shoot histamines back up to try to prevent it from leaking into your bloodstream [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12352.58s)]
*  So every time I eat food [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12357.42s)]
*  These my I just get like this like adrenaline like adrenal response because if they just shoot histamines back up into my intestine [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12359.74s)]
*  From under my intestinal walls back into my intestines and it just sends my body into like a state of shock [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12368.62s)]
*  So like when it was really bad [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr-DqSmJEXI&t=12374.380000000001s)]
