# Joe Rogan Experience #1966 - Big Jay  Oakerson & Ari Shaffir
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6.0s)]
*  And we're up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah, the NXIVM cult is the one that I still haven't watched that documentary. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=13.0s)]
*  I've been watching this doc- I've got a bit about the place that I used- that I bought before I bought the mothership. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=16.0s)]
*  Because it's about a place that was owned by a cult. So I've been watching the documentary on the cult. It's called Holy Hell. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=23.0s)]
*  It's so fucking crazy. I've been watching it- I've watched it three or four times to try to like find the angles for the bit. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=29.0s)]
*  Because the guy who ran it was a gay porn star who was also a hypnotist. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=35.0s)]
*  It's such a powerful combination. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=39.0s)]
*  All he wore was Speedos and eyeliner. And this dude ran this cult for 20 fucking years. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=42.0s)]
*  And they kicked him out and sent him to Hawaii. And now he's running in Hawaii. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=48.0s)]
*  At the end of the documentary, the guy goes to visit the guy in Hawaii. Now he's old and fucked up looking. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=52.0s)]
*  He's had a bunch of plastic surgery, like fake cheeks and his lips are done and everything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=57.0s)]
*  He looks like a monster. And he's still got these people falling around and open the doors for him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=61.0s)]
*  And he sits down and he talks like a guru. A complete con artist. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=66.0s)]
*  Did they show you his porns? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=71.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=72.0s)]
*  How was he? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=73.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, they just block out where the dick is going in the ass. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=74.0s)]
*  He's pounding this guy from behind. And then he's doing like a push-up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=76.0s)]
*  He's doing like a plank. And this guy is underneath him. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=81.0s)]
*  And the guy's holding onto his hips and he's just mouth fucking this guy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=84.0s)]
*  While his legs are completely suspended in the air. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=89.0s)]
*  Oh, he's just doing a workout. Military. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's basically doing a workout. So he's got like in a push-up position like this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=96.0s)]
*  And both of his legs are up there like that, pointed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=99.0s)]
*  And he's going like this and just humping this guy's mouth. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=102.0s)]
*  I mean, this is something that the cult members had found out while he was, you know, that's him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=105.0s)]
*  But see, when he got older he started looking creepy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=112.0s)]
*  You gotta realize this guy started this cult in 1981. He was an extra in Rosemary's Baby. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=115.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=121.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was like his claim to fame. He was just a bad actor. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=122.0s)]
*  He's got some young bucks with him. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=124.0s)]
*  Oh, he had all young bucks. And young, beautiful women too. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=125.0s)]
*  Like that's how he attracted the heterosexual men. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=128.0s)]
*  He had a bunch of young, beautiful women. But he told them never to have relationships together. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=131.0s)]
*  And then he fucked all the guys. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=135.0s)]
*  The move with the NXIVM guy did, because you can get a really good cult going, but you're... [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=136.0s)]
*  Everyone's not going to get the... even Charles Manson. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=143.0s)]
*  They always made it out to these young, pretty hippie girls. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=145.0s)]
*  When you see the pictures, they're all pretty rough. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=148.0s)]
*  The Manson ones? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=151.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then the NXIVM cult, it's the same thing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=152.0s)]
*  It's like they tell you all the people that were involved and like, except for like one girl, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=155.0s)]
*  like most of them were pretty homely. So you're like, yeah, I guess if you're... [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=159.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=163.0s)]
*  If your cult leader status is to bang a bunch of like, they're okays. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=164.0s)]
*  Well, this is like headshots after they've left the cult and realized it was over. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=168.0s)]
*  That girl's the actress. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=172.0s)]
*  What about Walsh? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=173.0s)]
*  She's the actress. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=174.0s)]
*  Which one? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=175.0s)]

*  I recognize her. But she's like secretary. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=177.0s)]
*  Yes, she was like, yes, exactly. I think she got out of fucking him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=179.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=183.0s)]
*  Because she would recruit the girls and brand them and stuff. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=184.0s)]
*  That girl's pretty. That girl's pretty. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=186.0s)]

*  Yeah, like those like... [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=200.0s)]
*  Could you imagine being trapped on one of those shows where you got to get a paycheck every week [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=201.0s)]
*  and the paycheck is wonderful. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=205.0s)]
*  Oh, no, dynasty of the lame. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=207.0s)]
*  You're probably making like a hundred grand a week. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=208.0s)]
*  So it's like... [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=210.0s)]
*  Catherine Oxenberg's daughter. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=211.0s)]

*  And you're like, this sucks. I didn't get into acting to do this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=216.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=217.0s)]
*  But is it a good career if you're like, take Lorenzo Lamas. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=218.0s)]

*  I don't know. It would really depend on how smart he is. I've never heard him talk. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=278.0s)]
*  Or what he did with his money, I guess. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=281.0s)]
*  Right. But also like how smart is he? Like are you stimulated there? Are you just happy to get attention? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=282.0s)]
*  I bet he's just happy to get attention. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=288.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=289.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=293.0s)]

*  But you know, saying with the Nexium guy and like the intelligence of them, it's weird like... [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=295.0s)]
*  Coffee? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=298.0s)]
*  Because the different states in life, like that guy made himself like very wealthy in that cult, the Nexium guy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=299.0s)]
*  Oh, he made himself wealthy by... [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=305.0s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. Because it's a Ponzi scheme. On top of the sex thing, it was most... first of all, it was a money thing, first and foremost. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=307.0s)]
*  Sex was bonus. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=314.0s)]
*  It was one of those schemes to do like, you know, they'd be like, put like, get five more people to join and... [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=315.0s)]
*  Oh, pyramid scheme. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=322.0s)]
*  Pyramid scheme. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=323.0s)]
*  Pyramid scheme for sure. And then once they were in and believed their life was getting better from that, he'd be like, hey girls, there's a little side project I got going on called like, you know, fuck me when I tell you to. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=324.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=335.0s)]
*  And... [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=336.0s)]
*  But weren't they like getting branded or something? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=337.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It gets greedy. Those things always go down because... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=339.0s)]
*  The guy has too much power and he keeps going. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=344.0s)]
*  Well, it's not enough to just be like, hey, I'm fucking three chicks. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=346.0s)]
*  Dude, it's Negan in the Walking Dead. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=349.0s)]
*  You can fuck three chicks and still you want to bank... the guy who worships you... [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=351.0s)]
*  His wife. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=355.0s)]
*  You want to see if you can get his wife too and it's crazy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=356.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=359.0s)]
*  And they always wind up doing it too. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=360.0s)]
*  They get it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=361.0s)]
*  Because the guy has to comply, they don't know what to do. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=362.0s)]
*  Like David Koresh, like he had a deal where he could fuck everyone's wife. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=364.0s)]
*  The people that get out of it, like sitting there and like, just seeing a guy... [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=368.0s)]
*  Just seeing it, I don't know how they stay together, like a guy and his wife sitting on a couch while the guy is hysterically crying like, I can't believe I sat in that room and waited for him to fuck you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=372.0s)]
*  I can believe it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=380.0s)]
*  That they stay together? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=384.0s)]
*  I can believe it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=385.0s)]
*  It's just tough. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=386.0s)]
*  There's guys like that out there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=387.0s)]
*  They're like, the girl can do anything. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=388.0s)]
*  She can shit in his face. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=389.0s)]
*  No, but they're like, no, don't do that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=390.0s)]
*  I don't do that to you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=393.0s)]
*  There's certain people. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=395.0s)]
*  And they have to complain about it the whole time? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=396.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's always been humans like that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=397.0s)]
*  There's like a spectrum of humans. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=399.0s)]
*  There's always been humans that you could just kind of like push around. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=401.0s)]
*  Walk over? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=403.0s)]
*  Do anything to, yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=404.0s)]
*  Well, the other one I just watched, I said, because this guy had no status in life. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=406.0s)]
*  It was an older guy who moved into his... [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=409.0s)]
*  Like, I think it was his daughter. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=413.0s)]
*  His daughter would always talk about how great her dad was and he was super involved in like SEAL team shit and with Gorbachev and all these past political dealings. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=415.0s)]
*  But he's in jail now because the government railroaded him. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=425.0s)]
*  This is what you would tell all of her dorm mates, or housemates in college. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=428.0s)]
*  But he rules. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=432.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=433.0s)]
*  And she's like, I'm going to go to jail. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=434.0s)]
*  And she's like, can he come live here with us for a while? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=435.0s)]
*  And then over the course of the next few years, like he just turns his daughter's house of friends into a sex cult. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=438.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=444.0s)]
*  Yeah, I heard about that one too. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=445.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=447.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=448.0s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of con men out there. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=449.0s)]
*  Also, what we were talking about before the podcast. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=453.0s)]
*  There's a lot of con men out there and con women. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=454.0s)]
*  There's a lot of con artists. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=456.0s)]
*  Do they con themselves or do they think some part of them is doing a good thing? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=457.0s)]
*  No. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=460.0s)]
*  I mean, I think the Nexium guy is like, I am teaching them life skills and building them up. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=461.0s)]
*  Yeah, I bet they lie to themselves. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=464.0s)]
*  I bet they say, yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=465.0s)]
*  But there's a little bit of that in there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=466.0s)]
*  Like, with this guy, what's fascinating about this holy hell thing, in the beginning, the cult was amazing. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=467.0s)]
*  Like, it just, as it got older, the guy started fucking everybody. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=472.0s)]
*  He started fucking all the men. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=477.0s)]
*  That's one of the things that he did as he got older. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=478.0s)]
*  Like, heterosexual men started fucking them and hypnotizing them. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=479.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, he started telling people to get plastic surgery so he could see what it looked like. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=482.0s)]
*  Like, he wanted to get his cheeks done so he had his followers get the cheeks done. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=488.0s)]
*  What happened with him is he was beautiful when he was young. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=492.0s)]
*  That's the guy who made the documentary. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=496.0s)]
*  That's Will Allen. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=498.0s)]
*  He's the guy who made it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=499.0s)]
*  Also pretty. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=500.0s)]
*  But if he got you also, all the people were good looking. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=501.0s)]
*  Can't really put his ass on the line. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=504.0s)]
*  The picture of him up there with his arms up in the air and everyone's got their hands up, that's him older, but still fucking ripped and jacked. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=505.0s)]
*  But when he was young, in the beginning of the documentary, he was a beautiful man. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=513.0s)]
*  Like, perfect features and this amazing body and he was a ballet dancer. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=517.0s)]
*  And he put on this fake accent. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=521.0s)]
*  What accent? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=523.0s)]
*  Like he was a guru. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=524.0s)]
*  Like, I am here to tell you, you are just life. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=527.0s)]
*  Life is beautiful. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=530.0s)]
*  You know, that kind of shit. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=531.0s)]
*  I'm sure the guy, I mean, he's a fucking actor, right? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=532.0s)]
*  Do you think right away he knows, I can never get you to get out, you're not going to be part of my cult? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=535.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=538.0s)]
*  And he just gets the weakest people. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=539.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you stumbled in there first of all. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=540.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'd take me. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=542.0s)]
*  He'd be like, you're not our type. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=543.0s)]
*  No. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=544.0s)]
*  You've got to be good looking. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=545.0s)]
*  I'll prove it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=546.0s)]
*  You're not that good looking. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=547.0s)]
*  I love you, Jack. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=548.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=549.0s)]
*  You're not the best looking guy. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=550.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=551.0s)]
*  On Gay Island, I would have trouble there. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=552.0s)]
*  There would be a problem. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=553.0s)]
*  And then guys like you or I or any of us, we'd be like, what are you doing? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=554.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=559.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=560.0s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=561.0s)]
*  How do you guys make money? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=562.0s)]
*  Who's making money? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=563.0s)]
*  Where's the money going? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=564.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have a question early on. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=565.0s)]
*  Their talent is finding people who are lost and don't ask questions. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=567.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=571.0s)]
*  Or like I'm sure it's the idea of like, when you tell me you hear those things, like where's [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=572.0s)]
*  the point where you have to go, hey, wait, wait, wait. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=575.0s)]
*  That doesn't make sense to me. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=578.0s)]
*  They all come from yoga classes. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=579.0s)]
*  I mean all his guys, his people. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=581.0s)]
*  He would teach yoga classes in LA. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=583.0s)]
*  And that's how he'd find them. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=585.0s)]
*  If you go to yoga, I mean there's a lot of people in yoga. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=587.0s)]
*  There's a spectrum. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=589.0s)]
*  But there's a certain percentage of guaranteed lost people in yoga classes. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=590.0s)]
*  CrossFit had that too. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=595.0s)]
*  When I was doing CrossFit, like how much they, and another thing, that's why it wasn't like [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=596.0s)]
*  buying into the, they said, before I took CrossFit, they were like, you know, some people [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=601.0s)]
*  go, ah, it's cultish, dude, it's weird. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=605.0s)]
*  And I go, I don't even know what that means. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=606.0s)]
*  I walk in and I do the thing that's on the board that says to do at the time I can do [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=608.0s)]
*  it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=612.0s)]
*  And then I go home. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=613.0s)]
*  But I then did realize after being there for like a year, I'm like, these guys are [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=614.0s)]
*  having barbecues every weekend. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=618.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=619.0s)]
*  And they really do. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=620.0s)]
*  They start hanging. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=621.0s)]
*  And then people, the owner of the CrossFit gym, like there was two guys who owned it, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=622.0s)]
*  both married guys. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=628.0s)]
*  I think both of them started fucking girls in the class and like had, at least one of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=629.0s)]
*  them did for sure. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=634.0s)]
*  And the family broke up. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=635.0s)]
*  And he was very publicly with this like much younger girl from class. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=636.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=639.0s)]
*  There's going to be a segment of the class that wants the approval of the teacher. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=640.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=643.0s)]
*  Like real bad. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=644.0s)]
*  This guy, they would call him the teacher. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=645.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=646.0s)]
*  He had all these different, well here's the thing. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=647.0s)]
*  His name was Jaime Gomez. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=649.0s)]
*  So he had to change it right away. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=651.0s)]
*  You can't fly with that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=654.0s)]
*  Jaime Gomez fixes Toyotas. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=656.0s)]
*  Jaime Gomez is on the Canelo Alvarez undercar. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=659.0s)]
*  He doesn't bring you the answers from the universe. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=663.0s)]
*  That's him when he was already older and looking creepy. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=665.0s)]
*  If you go to like, go to his name, Jaime Gomez Rosemary's baby. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=667.0s)]
*  I don't think he called him, I think he called himself Michelle by back then. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=672.0s)]
*  He changed his name three times, four times. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=676.0s)]
*  Four times. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=679.0s)]
*  So he changes his name, that's him right there. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=680.0s)]
*  Like look at that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=682.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=683.0s)]
*  Like, which beautiful man. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=684.0s)]
*  The one in the white. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=685.0s)]
*  The guy with the white. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=686.0s)]
*  That's him in Rosemary's baby. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=687.0s)]
*  So, you know, so hypnotic, right? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=689.0s)]
*  Just something about people with beautiful features. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=691.0s)]
*  They can talk more people into things, right? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=693.0s)]
*  Perfect skin. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=695.0s)]
*  So this guy is ripped, he's walking around in a Speedo. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=696.0s)]
*  And he's saying all these things that in the beginning make everybody happy. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=699.0s)]
*  And he does this thing where he puts them in a meditative state and he touches their forehead [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=703.0s)]
*  and he tells them that when he touches their forehead they're going to experience orgasms [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=708.0s)]
*  and feel the universe. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=712.0s)]
*  What? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=713.0s)]
*  And these people have, they're legitimately tripping balls. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=714.0s)]
*  Because it's the power of suggestion and hypnosis, so he's hypnotizing these people. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=717.0s)]
*  And then he's putting, like in the beginning of the cult, it's amazing. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=722.0s)]
*  Like no one seems to have a problem in the beginning. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=726.0s)]
*  That's the thing about these things. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=728.0s)]
*  When you watch the beginning of Wild Wild Country, same shit. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=730.0s)]
*  The beginning looks amazing. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=733.0s)]
*  You're almost like, I want to join. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=734.0s)]
*  That's my friend Todd's answer to me. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=736.0s)]
*  He goes, dude, I want to shut it off after episode one. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=738.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. Let's get out there. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=741.0s)]
*  He's like, I want to go find them. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=743.0s)]
*  I want to join. It looks like they're having a good time. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=744.0s)]
*  Because most people live these fucking miserable lives doing a job they don't like to do. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=747.0s)]
*  And if someone will tell you, like you've got a community. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=752.0s)]
*  We eat together, we pray together, they all meditate together, they all splash around the water. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=755.0s)]
*  It looks like they're having a great fucking time. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=759.0s)]
*  But as the guy gets older, he gets creepier. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=762.0s)]
*  And the cult awareness network goes after him. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=766.0s)]
*  So he has to leave LA in the middle of the night, and he moves to Texas. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=769.0s)]
*  And so he sets up shop in Texas. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=773.0s)]
*  How are they not going to find him in Texas? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=775.0s)]
*  Changed his name again. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=777.0s)]
*  This is the 90s, bro. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=778.0s)]
*  This is the 90s, right? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=782.0s)]
*  He starts the cult in like 81. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=783.0s)]
*  So in the early 90s, there's these weirdos splashing around in Barton Springs, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=785.0s)]
*  holding hands with this guy who wears Speedos and an eyeliner. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=790.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=794.0s)]
*  And that's where they got him. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=795.0s)]
*  So he changes his name from Michelle to Andreas. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=796.0s)]
*  And so Andreas, now he's getting older. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=799.0s)]
*  He starts getting weird. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=802.0s)]
*  And one of the things he starts doing is fucking with his face. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=803.0s)]
*  He starts like shoving cheek things in and pulling things back and lips. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=805.0s)]
*  He looks fucking weird. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=809.0s)]
*  And he's just hanging on to like his good looks. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=811.0s)]
*  And it throws them off because it doesn't fly with his message. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=817.0s)]
*  Your body is a vessel. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=820.0s)]
*  Your body is just a vessel. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=822.0s)]
*  I know you're getting cut up. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=823.0s)]
*  You are God. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=824.0s)]
*  We are all God. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=825.0s)]
*  But now all of a sudden he's getting facial surgery. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=826.0s)]
*  And they're like, huh. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=829.0s)]
*  And so then a guy leaves. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=830.0s)]
*  He was more gay than leader. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=831.0s)]
*  Got one out of a three. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=833.0s)]
*  He's like, well, I've got to get the face fixed. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=835.0s)]
*  More gay than guru. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=837.0s)]
*  He had to get the face done. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=839.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=841.0s)]
*  It's a fascinating documentary, man. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=842.0s)]
*  I love all those things. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=844.0s)]
*  I love when you watch one of these things. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=845.0s)]
*  That one, the dude who fucked the whole family in Utah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=846.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=850.0s)]
*  That was great. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=851.0s)]
*  But you're watching. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=852.0s)]
*  You're just like, how do I not know about this? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=853.0s)]
*  Dude, I think there's certain people that, I mean, I think this is why cults work. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=854.0s)]
*  I think this is why some people become religious zealots and suicide bombers. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=858.0s)]
*  There's certain people that are just fucking really gullible, man. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=862.0s)]
*  You can get them. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=866.0s)]
*  Well, not one of them ever. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=868.0s)]
*  Most of them when they're interviewed afterwards, when they're out, they always say that same [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=869.0s)]
*  line of like, I know what cults were. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=874.0s)]
*  And in fact, when they would explain to people what was going on, they'd be like, I know what you're thinking. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=877.0s)]
*  This isn't a cult. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=882.0s)]
*  It's just a bunch of people living together, dressing the same, doing whatever. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=884.0s)]
*  They talk about it in the documentary. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=887.0s)]
*  They explain a cult while they keep telling you, no, it's not that. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=889.0s)]
*  We just all eat under the same tray. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=892.0s)]
*  We don't eat proteins. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=894.0s)]
*  In the documentary, they were saying, well, they were choking around that everybody thinks it's a cult. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=895.0s)]
*  And they're like, well, if we're in a cult, at least we're in a good one. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=900.0s)]
*  And it was for a long time until one guy leaves the cult and sends out a mass email. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=904.0s)]
*  It's like, hey, man, this guy's been hypnotizing me and fucking me for the past 10 years. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=909.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=913.0s)]
*  He found out he was being hypnotized. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=914.0s)]
*  Oh, I mean, he's doing hypnotherapy on them. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=915.0s)]
*  Remember in Boston? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=917.0s)]
*  Remember in Boston, the hypnotist? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=919.0s)]
*  Frank Santos. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=921.0s)]
*  Yeah. And we saw a door guy pass out. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=922.0s)]
*  He tried to do the whole room and a door guy off to the left was just gone and somebody pointed out to him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=924.0s)]
*  That guy would be, that door guy would be like a candidate. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=928.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=931.0s)]
*  Well, when we used to do stitches, when Greg Simmons and I were coming up in Boston, Frank Santos was the fucking man. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=932.0s)]
*  And we would all go watch because it was a comedy hypnotism show. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=938.0s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=942.0s)]
*  And you would put people under. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=943.0s)]
*  And some people you couldn't put under. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=944.0s)]
*  Some people would just in front. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=945.0s)]
*  Because you're doing it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=947.0s)]
*  It's not like you could get hypnotized if you wanted to in a relaxed setting. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=948.0s)]
*  I had it done once. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=952.0s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=953.0s)]
*  And you, yeah. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=954.0s)]
*  My friend Vinny Shorman, he hypnotizes fighters and he gets to like get to the root of like whatever their conflict is. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=955.0s)]
*  Whatever their conflict in their mind is and try to sort things out, make them perform better. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=960.0s)]
*  It's not what you're thinking. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=964.0s)]
*  That's why I always don't believe in it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=965.0s)]
*  It's because it's not what I'm, they're not like, you know, when your eyes are open, like walk that way. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=967.0s)]
*  Maybe not you. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=971.0s)]
*  Here's my concern. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=972.0s)]
*  Maybe some people you can do that too. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=973.0s)]
*  This is what I think. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=976.0s)]
*  I think what I experienced was like a different state of mind. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=977.0s)]
*  It seemed like, I'm like, wow, this is like a drug. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=981.0s)]
*  Like I'm on a drug. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=984.0s)]
*  I mean, this is very strange. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=985.0s)]
*  But it was very pleasant and it was very, it was very, I was present and pleasant. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=986.0s)]
*  It was like I was right there and I was like looking at things from a different angle. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=992.0s)]
*  It's almost like I had removed some layers of clothing that was like my conditioning in life. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=996.0s)]
*  I got to look at things. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1002.0s)]
*  Like this is very much like a psychedelic drug. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1003.0s)]
*  Someone described to me once or I heard, actually I think it was on Howard Stern also a hypnotist that came on that does their thing, said, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1005.0s)]
*  this is essentially in a level hypnotizing. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1012.0s)]
*  They're listening to this while driving in a car and they're just like not even thinking. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1015.0s)]
*  They're just kind of like, but it's still a state of hypnosis when you're just kind of driving and not thinking. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1018.0s)]
*  You're not hitting cars. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1024.0s)]
*  You're not in danger of crashing. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1025.0s)]
*  You're just like on this complete, present autopilot. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1026.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1030.0s)]
*  Doesn't that weird you out when you find yourself doing that? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1031.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1033.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1034.0s)]
*  Like I'm doing everything right. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1035.0s)]
*  I'm on the right road. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1036.0s)]
*  I'm in the right lane. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1037.0s)]
*  I forgot if the last three lights were green. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1038.0s)]
*  Yeah, but how did I? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1039.0s)]
*  Just baby dragging behind you. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1040.0s)]
*  How am I just zoning out while I'm driving? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1041.0s)]
*  You're like those last lights were green, right? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1043.0s)]
*  I'm not crazy. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1045.0s)]
*  Dude, it's so frustrating watching people text and drive and you watch them weave into the room. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1046.0s)]
*  You're like, pull your fucking phone down when you drive. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1049.0s)]
*  You can see it ahead. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1052.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1053.0s)]
*  That's a text for sure. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1054.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1055.0s)]
*  I always want to pull up to them. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1056.0s)]
*  Just look at them. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1057.0s)]
*  Look at them texting. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1058.0s)]
*  Look at them texting. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1059.0s)]
*  It's fucking jackass. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1060.0s)]
*  You know what I do when they're texting under red light and they're looking down, I'll just like honk next to them. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1061.0s)]
*  And so they just start going before it's all still red. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1065.0s)]
*  Look up. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1068.0s)]
*  Well, you don't have to do that now with CarPlay. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1069.0s)]
*  CarPlay is the shit. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1072.0s)]
*  You just speak your text? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1073.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1074.0s)]
*  I do it all the time. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1075.0s)]
*  I take care of so much shit when I'm on my way to work. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1076.0s)]
*  I can say, text Big J. Go fuck yourself. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1079.0s)]
*  Bam. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1082.0s)]
*  And it says, go fuck yourself. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1083.0s)]
*  Send it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1084.0s)]
*  And I go, yes, send it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1085.0s)]
*  Send. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1086.0s)]
*  I don't know what this is. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1087.0s)]
*  In my car, one time me and Dan Soder were driving somewhere and I was like, hey, Siri, you already got to say. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1088.0s)]
*  And it was, it was like, hey, Siri. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1096.0s)]
*  And it was like, what could it what would you like me to do? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1099.0s)]
*  And Soder just goes, suck my dick. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1102.0s)]
*  Joe. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1105.0s)]
*  And then the car goes, OK, I have no idea why I went, OK, texting, suck my dick to Anthony Cumea. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1106.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, that's hilarious. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1115.0s)]
*  I've never texted Anthony Cumea ever. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1117.0s)]
*  Hey, suck my dick, by the way. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1121.0s)]
*  If you have like a shitty microphone in your car, it'll fuck up. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1123.0s)]
*  Mine does that when it's like call so and so and they're like calling this other person. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1128.0s)]
*  You're like, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1131.0s)]
*  Mine, you know, I wear those little AirPods and sometimes I pick up the wrong ones. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1133.0s)]
*  I have ones that I have for the sauna and then ones for real world. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1137.0s)]
*  And the ones for the sauna, they get cooked. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1140.0s)]
*  They go bad. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1143.0s)]
*  They go bad. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1144.0s)]
*  So like the microphone's bad. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1145.0s)]
*  I'm talking to people like, where the fuck are you? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1146.0s)]
*  I'm like, all right, this mic's bad. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1148.0s)]
*  It's cooked. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1149.0s)]
*  It's over. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1150.0s)]
*  It's wet in it and shit and it gets fucked up. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1151.0s)]
*  But they still play music like you can still listen to audio books on them. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1153.0s)]
*  They know that never dies. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1157.0s)]
*  But the microphone's gone. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1158.0s)]
*  And so if I do that, like, hey, Siri, call Ari Shafir. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1160.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, texting Greg could be anybody. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1163.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't know what the fuck you're saying. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1165.0s)]
*  Aaron Snaffer. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1167.0s)]
*  It'll play a book for you. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1168.0s)]
*  I like you'll just keep guessing wrong, though. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1170.0s)]
*  It never goes. I don't get it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1172.0s)]
*  You don't understand. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1173.0s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1174.0s)]
*  One day it's going to talk to you like, hey, Jay, is that really what you want to say to your friend? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1175.0s)]
*  Why do you reconsider it? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1180.0s)]
*  You put self-check on it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1181.0s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1182.0s)]
*  Suck my dick, really? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1183.0s)]
*  To Anthony Kumia? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1184.0s)]
*  Are you ready to burn that bridge? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1185.0s)]
*  Do you think perhaps that Anthony Kumia is gay and are you gay? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1187.0s)]
*  Is that what you're trying to say with the text? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1191.0s)]
*  Can I get some context? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1193.0s)]
*  This is more about you than him? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1194.0s)]
*  What if you opt in for AI to give you advice? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1195.0s)]
*  That would be interesting. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1201.0s)]
*  Like, what if you opt in for that? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1202.0s)]
*  Like, high mathematical probability advice? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1204.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. If you opt in. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1207.0s)]
*  So if you say, text Anthony Kumia, suck my dick, and it's like, big Jay, what are we doing? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1208.0s)]
*  I need some context here, first of all. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1214.0s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1216.0s)]
*  Are you saying suck my dick because that's what you would like him to do? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1217.0s)]
*  And are you gay? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1220.0s)]
*  Or are you being insulting? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1221.0s)]
*  Is this impossibly homophobic? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1223.0s)]
*  Is this known as a classic projection? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1225.0s)]
*  Yeah. Is this what you want? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1227.0s)]
*  Do you really want to put that energy out there in the world? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1229.0s)]
*  The voice AI is going to be a problem. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1231.0s)]
*  Does it sound like you? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1235.0s)]
*  Does it sound like you? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1236.0s)]
*  That's going to be it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1237.0s)]
*  Because we made that joke when Soder left the bonfire, like, they gave us that program, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1238.0s)]
*  and they go, look, and you just type whatever, and Soder's voice will say, anything. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1242.0s)]
*  Anything. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1247.0s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1248.0s)]
*  Anything you want. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1249.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1250.0s)]
*  There's full podcasts of me having podcasts of people that I never talked to, like Steve Jobs. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1251.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1255.0s)]
*  There's a whole conversation with me and Steve Jobs, apparently. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1256.0s)]
*  That people just did on AI. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1258.0s)]
*  I think they did it all on AI. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1259.0s)]
*  They can do anything. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1260.0s)]
*  Now, it's over. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1261.0s)]
*  Like, it's over. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1262.0s)]
*  Like, any idea of what is or is not the truth is going to become a real problem. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1263.0s)]
*  Do we have a date on it? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1268.0s)]
*  Because I feel like I heard about it one day, chat GPS. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1269.0s)]
*  It just keeps going. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1272.0s)]
*  I mean, it's four right now. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1273.0s)]
*  It's going to get to five, and it's going to... [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1274.0s)]
*  What, level? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1276.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1277.0s)]
*  It's like different levels. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1278.0s)]
*  Like, early VR versus now is like miles different. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1279.0s)]
*  Nobody's getting nauseous anymore. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1282.0s)]
*  Fuck, I just had a question. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1283.0s)]
*  I can't remember what it was. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1284.0s)]
*  No, I feel like it's... [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1285.0s)]
*  What were we just talking about? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1286.0s)]
*  It hasn't changed as much. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1287.0s)]
*  AI. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1288.0s)]
*  Chat GPT going forward. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1289.0s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1290.0s)]
*  AI making decisions for you. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1291.0s)]
*  I'm not going to remember. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1292.0s)]
*  We're giving you suggestions. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1293.0s)]
*  I'm not going to remember. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1294.0s)]
*  But it has something to do with it. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1295.0s)]
*  The voice podcast that looked like you? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1298.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, using my voice. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1301.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1302.0s)]
*  This is what it was. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1303.0s)]
*  That fucking TikTok ban. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1304.0s)]
*  Like, what is this actual law? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1306.0s)]
*  Oh, that bill has nothing to do with TikTok, yeah. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1308.0s)]
*  Yeah, it has nothing to do with TikTok. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1310.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1311.0s)]
*  It's all about having power to restrict access to... [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1312.0s)]
*  What's the deal with TikTok? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1316.0s)]
*  Let's pull it up. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1317.0s)]
*  Let's figure out what it is. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1318.0s)]
*  Why did TikTok become like a fucking evil? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1319.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, they nailed it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1320.0s)]
*  Adam Curry doesn't think they are. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1322.0s)]
*  Adam Curry's perspective when I talked to him, and Adam Curry's brilliant. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1324.0s)]
*  He said he thinks that they're eating tech in America's lunch, and they're trying to [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1327.0s)]
*  block them out because it's a Chinese-owned company. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1332.0s)]
*  And because they're saying that China's scooping up all the data, guess what? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1334.0s)]
*  He goes, that's exactly what these other companies are doing. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1337.0s)]
*  They're all scooping up your data. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1340.0s)]
*  The idea that your data is going to China is a problem. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1342.0s)]
*  What does that mean it goes to China? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1344.0s)]
*  It's because China represents competition, and they developed an app that's the most [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1345.0s)]
*  addictive app ever. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1350.0s)]
*  That's just Adam Curry's... [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1351.0s)]
*  Is it Adam Curry, MTV original VJ? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1354.0s)]
*  Yeah, that guy's shit. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1356.0s)]
*  He's a huge tech guy. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1357.0s)]
*  Do you know, he's the fucking original podcaster. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1358.0s)]
*  He's the pod father. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1360.0s)]
*  He's number one. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1361.0s)]
*  Yeah, a couple things he was ground level on. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1362.0s)]
*  He's super deep in on the internet, man. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1365.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems the same. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1368.0s)]
*  It seems it's just an app that they're making money off ads. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1369.0s)]
*  I will say what I've never seen before, because Christine, my girlfriend, is like... [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1371.0s)]
*  She's on it nonstop. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1375.0s)]
*  And I really like that she stops herself now, but the fact that you're in a position where [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1376.0s)]
*  you have to stop yourself and she can't wait for me to go to the bathroom or whatever so [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1380.0s)]
*  she can just start seeing more of them. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1384.0s)]
*  And I'm genuinely afraid to try, but almost like the same way I want to try crack once, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1386.0s)]
*  like see what all the hubbub's about. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1393.0s)]
*  I want to go on and be like, I'm not into watching bite-sized videos or whatever. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1394.0s)]
*  It's not my thing. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1399.0s)]
*  What it does is it finds what you're into. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1400.0s)]
*  And one of the ways I know that is my 12-year-old and my 14-year-old have fucking completely [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1403.0s)]
*  different feeds. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1408.0s)]
*  They talk about it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1409.0s)]
*  Like, my 12-year-old is into weird facts and strange things. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1410.0s)]
*  All kinds of stuff that the 14-year-old's not into. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1414.0s)]
*  The 14-year-old's into dress-up videos. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1417.0s)]
*  It's like people are into different shit, and that's what it'll find your thing. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1419.0s)]
*  It's really good at that, but it's also super invasive. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1422.0s)]
*  But then the question is, how much do we know, other than what we found out from Twitter, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1426.0s)]
*  how much do we know about what these other companies are doing? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1430.0s)]
*  And you just sign up for someone's app. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1433.0s)]
*  How about when you're talking about something and then you see a Google ad for it? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1435.0s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1439.0s)]
*  We all know by now. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1441.0s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1442.0s)]
*  You can turn that off. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1444.0s)]
*  That's actually a function. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1445.0s)]
*  If you go into Facebook on your phone, all of them, you put turn microphone off. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1447.0s)]
*  It's an option. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1452.0s)]
*  So it doesn't do that. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1453.0s)]
*  If you turn the microphone off, though, the app doesn't do almost anything. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1454.0s)]
*  It's just annoying. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1458.0s)]
*  It tastes like a passive. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1459.0s)]
*  It makes you almost keep it on. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1460.0s)]
*  That's the only reason I have it on. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1462.0s)]
*  It hobbles it. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1463.0s)]
*  It hobbles it so it can listen to you constantly. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1464.0s)]
*  That's too far. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1466.0s)]
*  Following shopping habits or something, it's like maybe that's way too far. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1467.0s)]
*  What about like an Alexa helps you solve a crime because it was recording or something? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1471.0s)]
*  I hate that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1475.0s)]
*  If we didn't know, if this whole thing with Edward Snowden didn't come down, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1476.0s)]
*  and that was a long time ago, if you really stop and think about it, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1482.0s)]
*  we would have no fucking idea that there was a government full-scale surveillance program [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1486.0s)]
*  that was on the American people, like on everybody. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1494.0s)]
*  They could spy on anybody. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1497.0s)]
*  They don't have to have warrants anymore. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1498.0s)]
*  They can do whatever they want. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1500.0s)]
*  They can get all your emails, all your voicemails. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1502.0s)]
*  That is wild shit. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1504.0s)]
*  And we found out about it because a guy told everybody and then had to hide in Russia. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1506.0s)]
*  Damn, it's crazy. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1511.0s)]
*  Clear AI scrapped 30 billion images from Facebook and other social media sites [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1512.0s)]
*  and gave them to cops. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1516.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1518.0s)]
*  Puts them into a perpetual police lineup. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1519.0s)]
*  Oh, so no more of that. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1522.0s)]
*  They're not in the system. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1523.0s)]
*  They're not in the system. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1524.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1525.0s)]
*  30 billion images from Facebook and social media sites and gave them to police. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1526.0s)]
*  So now they have your name and your face. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1531.0s)]
*  So if you have a fake ID, if you get pulled over, they know exactly who you are, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1534.0s)]
*  and they can run that through some fucking computer that has a database. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1540.0s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1544.0s)]
*  Your social media, everything you've ever done. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1545.0s)]
*  That's so much deeper than DNA evidence because they would say that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1547.0s)]
*  If someone didn't have their DNA in the city, you couldn't find them. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1550.0s)]
*  It was their first time, like, crime, and they weren't in it now. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1554.0s)]
*  You could be like, dude, you buy a shovel recently. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1557.0s)]
*  You're in the system if you have a phone. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1559.0s)]
*  What is this TikTok law? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1561.0s)]
*  Because people are freaking out about it. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1562.0s)]
*  People are telling me that I have to look into it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1564.0s)]
*  Confusion is calling it the TikTok law. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1566.0s)]
*  The restrict act. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1568.0s)]
*  TikTok is not listed in there at all. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1569.0s)]
*  But that's like the don't say gay bill. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1572.0s)]
*  It never really says don't say gay in any of it. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1575.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was a misleading one. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1578.0s)]
*  It's very misleading. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1579.0s)]
*  But that's also kind of how it's being sold to people as like, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1580.0s)]
*  this is what's going to stop the bad TikTok stuff. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1582.0s)]
*  But it's like, hey, TikTok is not mentioned in here, so maybe it won't do that at all. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1584.0s)]
*  So what does it say? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1590.0s)]
*  So this is what instead of like just going after TikTok, they're making this sweeping act. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1591.0s)]
*  The restrict act is described as a systematic framework for addressing technology based threats to the security and safety of Americans. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1597.0s)]
*  That sounds ominous. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1605.0s)]
*  It grants the Secretary of Commerce the authority to review transactions by certain foreign entities [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1606.0s)]
*  who offer information and communications technologies, products and services in order to identify, investigate and mitigate undue and unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States or its citizens. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1614.0s)]
*  This is this includes but not limited to impact the country's critical infrastructure and digital economy, sabotage or subversion of ICTS in the United States. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1629.0s)]
*  Boy, that could be interpreted a lot of ways. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1641.0s)]
*  In which way? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1643.0s)]
*  Interference and manipulation of federal elections, which could mean you're just skeptical or you're gullible and you bought into some conspiracy theories and you're talking about them. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1644.0s)]
*  And instead of just being able to just talk like a nonsense person, you you get jacked. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1656.0s)]
*  So it's kind of like, yes, subverting the press. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1661.0s)]
*  Under mining the democratic process to steer policy and regulatory decisions in favor of the strategic objectives of a foreign adversary to the detriment of the national security of the United States. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1663.0s)]
*  Like, man, this is all so open to interpretation. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1675.0s)]
*  Like, think of those things impact the country's critical infrastructure and digital economy. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1680.0s)]
*  That's easy to do. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1685.0s)]
*  You can impact it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1686.0s)]
*  What? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1687.0s)]
*  What if you impacted in a positive way? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1688.0s)]
*  Like, what are you saying? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1690.0s)]
*  Impact it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1691.0s)]
*  The digital economy. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1692.0s)]
*  Like, how do they what have you done? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1693.0s)]
*  Do you promote a certain coin and it blows up? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1695.0s)]
*  Then you just impacted digital economy. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1698.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you if someone like think about like these Bitcoin guys, like if Elon posts a Dogecoin image, immediately Dogecoin goes up, right? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1700.0s)]
*  Doesn't that impact the digital economy? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1712.0s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1715.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1716.0s)]
*  So what if what if he says the crypto is bullshit because he believes it? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1717.0s)]
*  Well, doesn't that impact the digital economy? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1720.0s)]
*  Yeah, they could arrest them. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1723.0s)]
*  And are they talking about the digital economy that exists now? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1724.0s)]
*  Or are they talking about a centralized digital currency? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1727.0s)]
*  Was is which is what China does? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1730.0s)]
*  Is that what they're saying? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1732.0s)]
*  They want to do. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1733.0s)]
*  Are they saying that Elon Musk will be illegal for him to? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1734.0s)]
*  I don't know what they're saying. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1736.0s)]
*  The problem is the way that's I mean, obviously, I'm not a lawyer, but the way that's written scroll back down so I can read that the way that's written. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1738.0s)]
*  Yeah, impact to the country's critical infrastructure and digital economy and digital economy is included in there. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1745.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1752.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1754.0s)]
*  I never made money digitally. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1755.0s)]
*  Yeah, but look at this. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1757.0s)]
*  So this thing information, communications, technologies, products or services. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1759.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1765.0s)]
*  So this is this is ICTS sabotage or subversion of ICTS in the United States. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1766.0s)]
*  What's ICTS again? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1774.0s)]
*  So it's information, communications, technologies, products or services. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1775.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1779.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1780.0s)]
*  So in order to identify, investigate and mitigate undoing unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1781.0s)]
*  So if you did something that's so subversion. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1787.0s)]
*  So they're so imagine if you said, I think these people are full of shit and I think what they're trying to do is gain control of the United States. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1790.0s)]
*  And I think we should resist that. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1798.0s)]
*  That would fall. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1799.0s)]
*  And they're selling it as Tick Tock is doing this. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1801.0s)]
*  Tick Tock is subverting our elections or they're not even selling it that way. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1804.0s)]
*  So we have to be careful. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1808.0s)]
*  No, they're not even selling it that way. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1809.0s)]
*  So these countries are the foreign adversaries that may do bad stuff. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1811.0s)]
*  So they're like, it's a risk that they're going to do something bad with this. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1817.0s)]
*  Yeah, like they've listed using a VPN as a way to subvert that, which would be what? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1820.0s)]
*  And you get a gigantic fine. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1824.0s)]
*  Oh, 20 years in prison. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1826.0s)]
*  What to use a VPN here? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1827.0s)]
*  How do you still imagine? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1829.0s)]
*  How do you still? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1830.0s)]
*  Imagine if everybody says VPNs. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1831.0s)]
*  I'm almost sure you should get a VPN potentially criminalizing the use of a VPN service or side loading to access services blocked from doing business in the United States under the act. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1835.0s)]
*  Due to the text stating that no person may cause or aid a bad council command, induce procure permit or approve of the doing of any act that violates the orders issued under the act. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1846.0s)]
*  What? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1859.0s)]
*  So confused. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1860.0s)]
*  They're trying to gain more power. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1861.0s)]
*  This is creepy. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1863.0s)]
*  This is not good. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1864.0s)]
*  And I just got to hope that people wise up and don't pass this. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1866.0s)]
*  Does it seem like this is something that they're passing? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1869.0s)]
*  I don't know that it's gotten that far. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1872.0s)]
*  I know it's been proposed. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1874.0s)]
*  Do you think there's an order to it where it's like first we bill China as going after Hong Kong and Taiwan. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1875.0s)]
*  Now we see them as the enemy. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1881.0s)]
*  Now a business associated with them. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1882.0s)]
*  We can get rid of that now. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1884.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, man. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1885.0s)]
*  I mean, the problem is like tick tock zombifies people. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1886.0s)]
*  So like if you take it away, they're going to revolt. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1889.0s)]
*  Yeah, they want. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1892.0s)]
*  I don't think you have to take it away. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1893.0s)]
*  But I think that act has nothing to do with tick tock. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1895.0s)]
*  If people have like legitimate concerns that people are abusing and overusing tick tock, that's a conversation people should have. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1899.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1906.0s)]
*  But if this this is not that it's not because of that. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1907.0s)]
*  This is something that was used in the two about what they're getting. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1912.0s)]
*  All that stuff seemed very vague to me. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1913.0s)]
*  Obviously, I'm an idiot. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1915.0s)]
*  But all that stuff seems very vague when they're reading out like what they can get you for. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1916.0s)]
*  And that last thing about acts that are listed as impermissible under the act or whatever the fuck the wording was like, what the fuck is you covering all the bases? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1921.0s)]
*  It seems like it's so open to interpretation. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1930.0s)]
*  Now, imagine if something like that existed during the pandemic. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1934.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1938.0s)]
*  The beginning of pandemic where people go, you know, I don't know if these fucking masks work. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1939.0s)]
*  You know, you would immediately get that's against the public health. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1942.0s)]
*  That's against that. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1946.0s)]
*  That's right. That's exactly what they're saying. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1947.0s)]
*  Now we know they don't work. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1949.0s)]
*  So then it was we think that you can still get sick even if you get vaccinated. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1950.0s)]
*  That immediately you would get banned from things. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1955.0s)]
*  I don't think you get in place. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1957.0s)]
*  This guy got been gone. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1959.0s)]
*  A meme guy got found guilty for posting memes. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1960.0s)]
*  I don't know the exact details of his court. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1962.0s)]
*  He got found guilty. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1964.0s)]
*  Yeah, they found him guilty. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1965.0s)]
*  And then what? What does that mean? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1966.0s)]
*  Do you know the memes guy? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1967.0s)]
*  It was a very subtle parody of Hillary Clinton. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1968.0s)]
*  He was like trying to say with this thing like to Hillary voters, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1973.0s)]
*  they could just stay home and text your vote into this number. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1978.0s)]
*  Wasn't that it? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1980.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1981.0s)]
*  But it's parody. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1982.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1983.0s)]
*  They took it seriously. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1984.0s)]
*  Or somebody said, can you believe this is happening? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1985.0s)]
*  They found the dude who did it and they fucking arrested him. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1986.0s)]
*  What? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1989.0s)]
*  He tweeted that out. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1990.0s)]
*  Avoid the line. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1991.0s)]
*  Avoid the line. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1992.0s)]
*  Vote from home. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1993.0s)]
*  Text Hillary to 59925. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1994.0s)]
*  Vote for Hillary and be a part of history. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1996.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1998.0s)]
*  I mean, amazing. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=1999.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2000.0s)]
*  He was convicted today by a federal jury in Brooklyn of charge of conspiracy against the [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2001.0s)]
*  rights. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2007.0s)]
*  It's the context. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2008.0s)]
*  You took away the context of the parody. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2009.0s)]
*  Totally. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2010.0s)]
*  That's just subverting. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2011.0s)]
*  If you believe that was true, don't vote anyway, man. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2012.0s)]
*  You shouldn't get a vote. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2016.0s)]
*  You shouldn't be able to vote if you get duped by that. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2018.0s)]
*  Was there a line? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2022.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2023.0s)]
*  Why would anybody wait in line? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2024.0s)]
*  We're worried about old people, right? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2025.0s)]
*  But at a certain point, Dom, should you really still be voting? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2027.0s)]
*  If you can't drive without murdering a bunch of people at a fair, you cannot vote. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2030.0s)]
*  There's this recent conversation that Biden had with Don Lemon. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2035.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2039.0s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2040.0s)]
*  No. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2041.0s)]
*  There's this recent conversation where he's like, he asked him if he's been vaccinated. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2042.0s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2046.0s)]
*  He has Biden who's vaccinated? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2047.0s)]
*  Now, again, I don't know if this is real. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2050.0s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2052.0s)]
*  I didn't watch it when it came out. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2053.0s)]
*  And with AI now- [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2055.0s)]
*  You don't know if it's real anymore? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2056.0s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck is real. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2057.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2058.0s)]
*  I love the idea that we're not going to believe anything in pictures. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2059.0s)]
*  It's only going to be a real life. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2061.0s)]
*  That's all we can accept. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2062.0s)]
*  But this is like a video of Biden stammering. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2063.0s)]
*  We can't find what he's talking about, and he's kind of drifting and talking about different [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2065.0s)]
*  things, and none of it makes any sense to anybody. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2069.0s)]
*  And how long goes it from? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2072.0s)]
*  Now it works. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2074.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2075.0s)]
*  You got the vaccination? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2076.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2077.0s)]
*  Are you okay? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2078.0s)]
*  I mean, you see, now it works. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2079.0s)]
*  Or the mom and dad. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2082.0s)]
*  Or the neighbor. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2085.0s)]
*  Or when you go to church. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2087.0s)]
*  No, I really mean it. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2089.0s)]
*  There are trust hidden in the lockers. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2091.0s)]
*  Think of the people. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2093.0s)]
*  If your kid wanted to find out whether or not there were, there's a man on the moon [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2095.0s)]
*  or whatever, you know, something, or whether those aliens are here or not, who are the [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2101.0s)]
*  people that you talk to beyond the kids who love talking about it? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2107.0s)]
*  I do feel sympathy. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2110.0s)]
*  I feel like when I smoke too much pop before a show, and I go on a tangent in the middle [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2111.0s)]
*  of a joke and don't know where I'm going. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2115.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2117.0s)]
*  That's how he sounds. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2118.0s)]
*  Those are fun. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2119.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm not saying, no, listen, for real though. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2120.0s)]
*  But wait, you were there. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2124.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2126.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2127.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2128.0s)]
*  Like at that point in time, should you still be voting? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2129.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2131.0s)]
*  Like if it wasn't the president. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2132.0s)]
*  I mean, if you can show, like, should we, I don't want to restrict anybody's right to [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2134.0s)]
*  vote, right? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2137.0s)]
*  Nobody does. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2138.0s)]
*  But if you're like some fucking crazy crackpot QAnon person and you've got an uncle that [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2139.0s)]
*  can't read anymore and you take him in and vote, we're going to fucking vote, we're going [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2144.0s)]
*  to migrate Taylor Green. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2148.0s)]
*  You know, you like start writing things in and like. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2149.0s)]
*  Also, if you can't vote till you're 18, maybe you have to stop when you're like 80. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2152.0s)]
*  Yeah, 80. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2157.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2158.0s)]
*  These laws aren't going to affect you. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2159.0s)]
*  They're going to affect us. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2161.0s)]
*  I mean, stop being in line. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2162.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2164.0s)]
*  Every day's a gift, bitch. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2165.0s)]
*  Just live it out. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2166.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2167.0s)]
*  The video was edited just a little bit apparently. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2168.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2169.0s)]
*  Oh, how much was it edited? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2170.0s)]
*  That's all you need. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2171.0s)]
*  You're trying to find out. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2172.0s)]
*  That's all you need. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2173.0s)]
*  You can't believe any of it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2174.0s)]
*  Amazing, though. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2175.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2176.0s)]
*  It looks so seamless. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2177.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2178.0s)]
*  He was telling, he went into a story. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2179.0s)]
*  He was answering his question, but then he went into a story and it took out that part, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2180.0s)]
*  I guess. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2182.0s)]
*  Oh, what cunts. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2183.0s)]
*  Just make him look rambling. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2184.0s)]
*  He pumpers around plenty, though. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2185.52s)]
*  He pumpers around plenty. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2187.24s)]
*  At some point, too. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2188.24s)]
*  Let's say you have the dad in a family who's leading it, then he becomes a little older [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2189.24s)]
*  and he starts going senile. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2192.0s)]
*  At some point, all the kids are like, we don't have to listen to him anymore, right? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2193.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2196.0s)]
*  You got to take care of him now. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2197.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2198.0s)]
*  You have to take care of dad or else he drives a lawn mower on the highway. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2200.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2203.0s)]
*  You have to take care of dad. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2204.0s)]
*  The other chicks are taking over at this point. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2205.0s)]
*  I have friends that have dads that are compromised. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2206.0s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2209.0s)]
*  It's like you can't leave them alone. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2210.72s)]
*  They don't know where they're going. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2212.2s)]
*  They'll just get in the car and drive. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2213.2s)]
*  They'll go someplace and forget how to get home. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2215.2s)]
*  And they don't want to get all the keys. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2217.4s)]
*  Well, they don't want to stop living their life. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2219.0s)]
*  And then sometimes you have to put them in a place where there's going to be medical [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2221.48s)]
*  supervisors watching over them because they don't know what's going on. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2225.88s)]
*  How awful is it? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2230.6800000000003s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  Bruce Willis knows it's coming. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2232.6800000000003s)]
*  He's not even there yet. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2234.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's like what? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2236.28s)]
*  It's incurable what he's got. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2238.88s)]
*  He's pretty fucked up. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2239.88s)]
*  He's got something called aphasia. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2241.08s)]
*  And then there's also some other diagnosis that he got recently, some form of dementia. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2242.92s)]
*  No. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2247.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, some neurodegenerative. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2248.6400000000003s)]
*  Bruce fucking Willis? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2249.92s)]
*  It won't get better. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2252.04s)]
*  And he's aware that over the next probably year, I guess, or so, he's going to become [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2253.12s)]
*  not aware of what's going on around him. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2258.56s)]
*  God, what causes that? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2259.92s)]
*  It's something with a... [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2262.0s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2263.0s)]
*  Would you just go into senility or would you handle it? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2264.0s)]
*  I would try mushrooms. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2266.4s)]
*  Because the neurodegenerative process of any kind of a disease like that, I would imagine [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2267.8s)]
*  when you talk about... [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2274.6s)]
*  There's a thing that mushrooms can do. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2276.72s)]
*  Change your neural pathway? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2279.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2280.12s)]
*  Lion's mane and... [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2281.12s)]
*  Golden t-shirts. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2282.12s)]
*  And psilocybin. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2283.12s)]
*  They apparently can help to grow neurons, which is very, very unusual. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2284.12s)]
*  There's something about it. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2291.48s)]
*  Psychedelic drugs actually help neurons in the brain sprout new dentrites, which look [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2292.48s)]
*  like branches on a tree, to increase communication between cells. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2298.52s)]
*  These drugs can increase neural outgrowth. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2303.12s)]
*  They can increase the branching of neurons. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2305.7999999999997s)]
*  They can increase your synapses. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2307.92s)]
*  I would imagine if they can do that, that there's probably some benefit if someone's [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2310.56s)]
*  got something wrong with their mind. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2315.88s)]
*  It seems like it's feeding the mind. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2318.44s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2320.64s)]
*  It's worth a try. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2321.64s)]
*  May as well. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2322.64s)]
*  Dude, that's the greatest theory of all time, is Terrence McKenna's stoned ape theory. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2323.64s)]
*  That just evolved them? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2327.36s)]
*  You think that's how people became people? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2328.36s)]
*  We were primates and we stumbled upon mushrooms and we started eating them and then we became [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2330.92s)]
*  better hunters. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2335.64s)]
*  We got smarter. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2337.08s)]
*  If it does that, doesn't that make sense? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2338.08s)]
*  If you're a monkey and you're eating mushrooms all the time, you probably figure out things. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2340.44s)]
*  I like to imagine it happen instantly, where the mushrooms, the monkeys eat it, and then [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2345.24s)]
*  just suddenly they're like, what? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2349.36s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2351.16s)]
*  There's a video on that. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2352.16s)]
*  You just got back? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2353.16s)]
*  Yeah, what the fuck? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2354.16s)]
*  There's a video. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2355.16s)]
*  There's dude Bob Seska. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2356.16s)]
*  He made a video about that. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2357.16s)]
*  Nobody ever reads tons and tons of mushrooms though. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2359.12s)]
*  Seems like they're evolving. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2361.28s)]
*  Yeah, true. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2362.28s)]

*  Here it goes. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2439.2s)]
*  Bob Seska. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2440.2s)]
*  I actually had him make this back in like, man, I want to say like the 90s. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2441.2s)]
*  It might have been like 2000 or something like that. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2448.56s)]
*  Or 2001. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2451.56s)]

*  Did you get it? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2455.0s)]
*  It's the stone dap theory. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2457.0s)]
*  Go full screen. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2459.2000000000003s)]
*  It's made a long time ago. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2460.2000000000003s)]
*  My name is Steve. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2477.88s)]
*  How dope is that? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2507.88s)]
*  Damn, that's cool. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2518.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay I fucked up. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2523.2400000000002s)]
*  I fucked up. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2524.2400000000002s)]
*  That's not Bob Seska. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2525.2400000000002s)]
*  That's not the one he made for me. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  That's a different one. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2527.2400000000002s)]
*  But that one's awesome. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2528.2400000000002s)]
*  There's, who did that? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2529.2400000000002s)]
*  Can you find out who made that? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2530.2400000000002s)]
*  That's possible? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2531.2400000000002s)]
*  That was on Comedy Central. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2532.2400000000002s)]
*  It's funny, it's on Comedy Central and then the video underneath of it said like, you [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  Why the stone dap theory is bad. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2538.4s)]
*  It was on Comedy Central, first of all, relax. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2540.6000000000004s)]
*  The Bob Seska one now I remember was different. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2544.96s)]
*  It had like aliens and laser beams. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2547.04s)]
*  That one was cool. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2549.4s)]
*  Yeah, do you remember that one? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2550.4s)]
*  No, this one was cool. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2551.4s)]
*  Well that one was dope as fuck. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2552.4s)]
*  That was not the one that I had anything to do with. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2553.4s)]
*  But that's Terrence McKenna's theory. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2556.36s)]
*  He thinks that they just started eating mushrooms and figuring things out. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2557.84s)]
*  It's backed by climate science. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2562.0s)]
*  That was at the time, there's a giant jump in human brain size over a period of like [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2564.4399999999996s)]
*  two million years, the human brain doubles, which is bananas, apparently. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2569.52s)]
*  And so what it coincides with tip tank, trip tank, trip tank, stone dap theory. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2573.4799999999996s)]
*  But is that just the website that has it hosted? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2580.9599999999996s)]
*  It was a show on. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2583.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, that was the show called trip tank. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2584.9599999999996s)]
*  That fucking thing is awesome. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2588.24s)]
*  So he thinks that this time, this period of two million years, it coincides with these [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2590.6s)]
*  rainforest receding into grasslands. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2596.44s)]
*  And so the food sources change because then there's cows shitting in the grass and then [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2599.0s)]
*  they're looking for different things to eat and they flip over cow patties and find like [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2603.16s)]
*  bugs and shit to eat. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2606.44s)]
*  They've always done that. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2608.08s)]
*  And they're just like, this is a vegetable. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2609.08s)]
*  They ate the mushrooms too. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2610.08s)]
*  They tried them. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2611.52s)]
*  And when they ate them, they realized it makes them see better. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2612.52s)]
*  It increases visual acuity and low doses. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2615.08s)]
*  And it also makes you horny. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2617.56s)]
*  It produces synesthesia, which helps cultivate language. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2618.8s)]
*  Dennis McKenna has the best descriptive of it because he's Terrence's brother, this [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2626.28s)]
*  legit scientist, the genius. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2631.1600000000003s)]
*  And the way he breaks it down, he talks about the way psilocybin interacts with the brain [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2633.04s)]
*  is really perfectly aligned with something that would make the brain grow if primates [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2637.96s)]
*  just kept eating it and evolved into what we are now. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2643.1200000000003s)]
*  We might be a combination of like animal and mushroom. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2647.0s)]
*  They say that from another planet. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2651.28s)]
*  Joe, you can't eat them. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2653.6s)]
*  I can't. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2654.6s)]
*  That's what I was going to say. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2655.6s)]
*  They're so for some, you're saying all these beautiful things it does. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2656.6s)]
*  It makes your brain grow. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2659.44s)]
*  What happens to you? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2660.64s)]
*  It's the connective tissue of language. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2661.64s)]
*  And if I eat them up, there's a scroll, like the texture and taste, nothing to do with [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2662.64s)]
*  all the magic of them. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2666.28s)]
*  Get candies. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2667.28s)]
*  No, I will. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2668.28s)]
*  That's what I'll do like generally. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2669.28s)]
*  But like it is funny that they eat them actually. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2670.28s)]
*  I'll throw them right back up on pure text. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2672.28s)]
*  Nothing to do with the poison in them or anything. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2675.48s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2677.44s)]
*  It's dusty. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2678.44s)]
*  I like them. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2679.44s)]
*  They're a good taste. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2680.44s)]
*  If I get chicken gristle in my mouth, I go gag over a trash can for five minutes. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2681.44s)]
*  I like just the straight mushroom because you know what you're getting too. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2686.68s)]
*  You're not fucking around with some ground up pills that some hippie made. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2690.8s)]
*  That's why I never understand like edibles to me. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2694.88s)]
*  Was it .1 or 1? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2697.76s)]
*  I had a bit about that. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2699.2s)]
*  When someone's made like a batch of like weed brownies or something, you go, well, what [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2700.2s)]
*  What if all the weeds and how do you fucking possibly know that? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2704.44s)]
*  Yeah, they don't. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2707.36s)]

*  I was on a reality show. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2798.2400000000002s)]
*  I thought there were cameras watching me and I'm like, from fucking weed stuff? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2799.2400000000002s)]
*  You ever see the video when Joey Diaz doses Owen Benjamin on the show with it? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2802.84s)]
*  Owen loses it, dude. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2807.2400000000002s)]
*  It was epic. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2809.2400000000002s)]

*  Is that what sent him into the woods? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2814.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2817.2400000000002s)]
*  Maybe, maybe. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2818.2400000000002s)]
*  Those are strong doses. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2819.2400000000002s)]
*  Look, there's a real thing with that. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2821.2s)]
*  Alex Berenson wrote a book called Tell Your Children. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2823.2s)]
*  And it's all about instances of psychotic breaks and schizophrenic breaks from people [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2826.2s)]
*  that are heavy marijuana users. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2831.7599999999998s)]
*  There's like a something that happens to some people where maybe they have a tendency to [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2833.9199999999996s)]
*  schizophrenia or maybe a tendency. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2838.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it's that, yeah, genetic predisposition or something. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2840.7999999999997s)]
*  And then a high dose of weed just pushes them over the edge. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2841.7999999999997s)]
*  And I've seen it happen. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2846.3399999999997s)]
*  I know people that have lost their shit. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2848.52s)]
*  They're not the same guy anymore. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2850.52s)]
*  And they don't come back? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2851.52s)]
*  They're not coming back. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2852.52s)]
*  They're not coming back. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2853.52s)]
*  Because most of them, they keep smoking it. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2854.52s)]
*  I know one guy who came back. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2856.52s)]
*  One guy came back. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2857.52s)]
*  One guy was like, I'm just watching the FBIs on my, I'm like, dude, you're a fucking middle act. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2858.52s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2863.52s)]
*  But he came back. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2864.52s)]
*  He came back. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2865.52s)]
*  He just stopped smoking weed for a long time. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2866.52s)]
*  And he was one day like, wow, that was pretty crazy shit. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2868.52s)]
*  I can't give any more details. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2871.52s)]
*  But it was, he's all right. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2872.52s)]
*  But I know another guy who came back, too. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2876.16s)]
*  You ever talk to Shane Moss about his like? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2879.16s)]
*  That's who I was thinking of. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2881.16s)]
*  I think 30 days, he did what every day? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2882.16s)]
*  Mushrooms. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2885.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2886.16s)]
*  And then he like covered himself with some mud that wouldn't let the mushrooms breathe out of him. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2887.16s)]
*  And he went to another place. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2891.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2894.16s)]
*  I saw him way later. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2895.16s)]
*  And it was like, dude, I know this sounds crazy, but mathematicians are coming up to me telling me that I figured it out. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2897.16s)]
*  I know, realistically, I know. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2902.7999999999997s)]
*  But I'm telling you, these mathematicians are telling me I have all the answers. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2904.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2907.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2908.7999999999997s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2909.7999999999997s)]
*  He's back now, but like. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2910.7999999999997s)]
*  Talking to somebody who's disconnected is. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2911.7999999999997s)]
*  Odd. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2913.7999999999997s)]
*  It's also trying. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2914.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, it's very like, it's funny for a second. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2915.7999999999997s)]
*  Not funny, but it's almost like amusing for a second how like out of it they are. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  And then it's terrifying that that could happen to someone's brain. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2922.7999999999997s)]
*  Didn't Huberman just post something? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2924.7999999999997s)]
*  Someone told me that, oh, Tulsi Gabbard told me this. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2926.7999999999997s)]
*  Huberman just posted something about marijuana in high doses with kids is leading to an alarming number of like mental illness problems. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2930.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2941.44s)]
*  I can see that. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2942.44s)]
*  They're not done developing? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2943.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2944.44s)]
*  I don't remember what he wrote. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2945.44s)]
*  I didn't read it. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2946.44s)]
*  I was just, I had a couple of cocktails. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2947.44s)]
*  I'm listening to a conversation. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2948.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2949.44s)]
*  Did you guys smoke or do whatever when you were like still growing? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2950.44s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2954.44s)]
*  You didn't for sure, right? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2955.44s)]
*  No. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2956.44s)]
*  I did not. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2957.44s)]
*  I mean, I did. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2958.44s)]
*  Like over the, from age, you know, from teenage years to 30 years old, I probably smoked pot five times. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2960.08s)]
*  No, but I mean like 12, I've been teen. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2967.08s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2970.08s)]
*  No, I didn't do anything. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2971.08s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2972.08s)]
*  That was the years that I was martial arts. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2973.08s)]
*  So I very rarely did anything. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2975.08s)]
*  I mean, if I had a beer, I felt guilty. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2977.08s)]
*  It was my dad smoked pot and I thought that's why he didn't show up a lot. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2979.08s)]
*  So, and so I didn't smoke pot until I was in my 20s. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2983.08s)]
*  And then drinking, I just, I had one of those like tried a sip young and thought it was [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2986.72s)]
*  so gross that I was like, I couldn't imagine. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2992.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2995.22s)]
*  And then also when you're young, you watch people get drunk and it's like that rookie [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=2996.22s)]

*  Yeah, they give it to them too. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3337.08s)]
*  They're like, okay. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3339.08s)]
*  They give it to them. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3340.08s)]
*  I mean, and for the cop, the cop's got to deal with that. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3341.08s)]
*  I know, it's funny when... [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3345.08s)]
*  Man, I forget what it was. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3347.08s)]
*  I was watching years ago. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3349.08s)]
*  It was a guy that was trying to do that, suicide by cop. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3350.08s)]
*  And they had... [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3353.08s)]
*  It wasn't even anymore like... [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3354.08s)]
*  In America, they had a sniper guy. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3357.08s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3360.08s)]
*  Like a roof, like a rooftop away across the street or something. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3361.08s)]
*  And he was describing like when the guy was holding the gun and he kept like... [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3366.08s)]
*  He just noticed that he mimicked emotion more than once. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3370.08s)]
*  Like kind of naturally, he kept doing the same thing with the gun. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3372.08s)]
*  And like the fourth time he raised the gun up, he shoots the gun out of his hand. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3375.08s)]
*  No. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3379.08s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3380.08s)]
*  And then the guy just goes and lays down on the ground. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3381.08s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3382.08s)]
*  Pretty wild. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3383.08s)]
*  Oh, I saw that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3384.08s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3385.08s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3386.08s)]
*  Damn. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3387.08s)]
*  But it's because his face... [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3388.08s)]
*  He wanted to die, but when that guy shot out of his hands, he just realized how he's like, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3389.08s)]
*  holy shit. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3391.08s)]
*  What the fuck just happened? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3392.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3393.08s)]
*  You don't even know what you're asking for. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3394.08s)]
*  That kind of a skill is... [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3396.08s)]
*  What a shot. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3398.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3399.08s)]

*  He's lucky in every way, shape, and... [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3415.08s)]
*  That guy should play the lottery right after that. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3416.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3418.08s)]

*  You should be dead. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3421.08s)]
*  You shouldn't have any fingers. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3422.08s)]
*  If it was Dog the Bounty Hunter arresting him, he would have let him get some lottery tickets. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3424.08s)]
*  He would have let him do everything. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3427.08s)]
*  He would have let him do everything. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3428.08s)]
*  He would have let him stop on the way home. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3429.08s)]
*  Is that what he does with you, Will? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3430.08s)]
*  He would hold their cigarette for them while they smoke, handcuffed. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3431.08s)]
*  Oh, would he really? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3434.08s)]
*  Talk to them about God. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3435.08s)]
*  He'd let them look at his wife's big fat titties. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3436.08s)]
*  Big fat ones. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3439.08s)]
*  Rest in peace with those big fat titties. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3440.08s)]
*  Oh, she's dead? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3442.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's already moved on to another chick. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3443.08s)]
*  What do you want him to do, wait? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3445.08s)]
*  Is Dog the Bounty Hunter? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3446.08s)]

*  Every day is a risk. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3458.08s)]
*  I can't believe for the, let's say, class of people they were, that there's not a loose [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3459.08s)]

*  In America somewhere? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3540.08s)]
*  With the cameras conveniently knowing where he was. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3541.08s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3544.08s)]
*  What are the odds that they know where he is? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3545.08s)]
*  Missouri. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3547.08s)]
*  Just exactly in the middle of a city. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3548.08s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3550.08s)]
*  He's knocking on doors. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3551.08s)]
*  He goes, do you know this guy? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3552.08s)]
*  He goes, yeah, everyone does. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3553.08s)]
*  He's on the news. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3554.08s)]
*  Yeah, that was a scary case. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3555.08s)]
*  Which one was that? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3560.08s)]
*  They got pulled over by the cops. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3562.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3564.08s)]
*  And they had been in some sort of a domestic squabble. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3565.08s)]
*  Again, domestic fights, right? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3567.08s)]
*  Squabble's a great word. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3568.08s)]
*  I don't know what the details were of it, but the cops let them go. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3569.08s)]
*  Well, in the rarest of situations... [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3574.08s)]
*  And then they did what? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3576.08s)]
*  I'm saying, but in the rarest of situations, they... [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3577.08s)]
*  I don't think this happens a lot, but the girl was crying and telling her story, and then the guy was telling his side of the story behind the cops. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3580.08s)]
*  And the cops were definitely more on his world of like... [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3589.08s)]
*  It's chicks, right? [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3592.08s)]
*  I mean, we're in small spaces. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3593.08s)]
*  You know how they act. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3594.08s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3595.08s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3596.08s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to sandbag the cops and say, but they're just like... [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3597.08s)]
*  For whatever's going on, she was hyper emotional and screaming and crying, and he was kind of like, eh, just bickering about whatever. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3600.08s)]
*  And then they just let him go. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3608.08s)]
*  And then what'd they do? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3610.08s)]
*  Probably a sociopath, right? [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3611.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3613.08s)]
*  Yeah, he probably figured out how to con the cops, and he killed her. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3614.08s)]
*  He killed her right afterwards. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3617.08s)]
*  Yeah, he killed her, and then either he killed himself... [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3618.08s)]
*  In the woods. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3621.08s)]
*  It's hard to know, because I think the alligators got to him. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3622.08s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3625.08s)]
*  I think when they found his body, he had been consumed. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3626.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he was alligators. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3630.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3631.08s)]
*  Pieces of him. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3632.08s)]
*  I think some things had consumed him. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3633.08s)]
*  It might be pigs, too. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3634.08s)]
*  There's a lot of wild pigs out there. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3635.08s)]
*  But the pigs will eat everything. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3636.08s)]
*  They'll eat your bones, man. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3638.08s)]
*  They'll eat everything. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3640.08s)]
*  If you leave a body where pigs are, that's the thing about Snatch. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3641.08s)]
*  We had a forensic psychologist on... [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3645.08s)]
*  It will be Snatch? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3646.08s)]
*  Kill Tony yesterday. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3647.08s)]
*  We asked him if that was a good way to kill people, and he said, yeah. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3648.08s)]
*  The remains were described as skeletal. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3650.08s)]
*  Were confirmed using dental records. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3652.08s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3654.08s)]
*  Oh, Brian Laundrie. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3655.08s)]
*  That's a different one. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3656.08s)]
*  No, that's the guy. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3657.08s)]
*  Oh, that's the Brian Laundrie. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3658.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3660.08s)]
*  That's the guy. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3661.08s)]
*  So he was consumed. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3662.08s)]
*  So it probably wasn't pigs. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3663.08s)]
*  It was probably rats. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3665.08s)]
*  He was found... [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3666.08s)]
*  No, gators would swallow you whole. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3667.08s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3669.08s)]
*  He was found, dare I say, through no help of Dog the Bounty Hunter. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3670.08s)]
*  Remember, they couldn't find him? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3673.08s)]
*  There was a national manhunt on for him. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3674.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3676.08s)]
*  And he was just out in the woods, or so. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3677.08s)]
*  We're not the woods. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3678.08s)]
*  The Everglades are so crazy. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3679.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3680.08s)]
*  Do you know the Everglades? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3681.08s)]
*  99% of all the mammals are missing. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3682.08s)]
*  Really? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3684.08s)]
*  99%. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3685.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3686.08s)]
*  Dude, I went... [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3687.08s)]
*  You know how when you're driving on the highway, you'll stop at a green belt or some hike [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3688.08s)]
*  or something? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3691.08s)]
*  So I did that at a rest stop in Florida, though, driving across the state. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3692.08s)]
*  And to go into the woods, you have to open up a giant gate that's like 20 feet high, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3696.08s)]
*  then a barrier, like the Berlin Wall, then another 20-foot high fence. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3700.08s)]
*  And you go in, and there's like a path and a sign, and it said, like, don't do this alone. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3704.08s)]
*  There's fucking Panthers everywhere. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3709.08s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3711.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3712.08s)]
*  So you have to be with somebody, and then I just turn around and left. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3713.08s)]
*  So they're probably thriving, but they need stuff to eat. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3714.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3718.08s)]
*  And the problem is everything's been killed by pythons. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3719.08s)]
*  Pythons. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3722.08s)]
*  There's a half a million pythons that are in the Everglades right now. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3723.08s)]
*  And there's also people who've spotted Nile crocodiles. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3728.08s)]
*  They don't think that Nile crocodiles are a breeding pair. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3731.08s)]
*  They think somebody might have had one and let it loose. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3734.08s)]
*  And if that's the case, it survived. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3736.08s)]
*  But if they have a shoot on site, like if you see Nile crocodiles, star-popped, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3739.08s)]
*  they get 20 feet long, and they eat fucking zebras. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3744.08s)]
*  Damn. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3747.08s)]
*  I mean, those things are giant. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3748.08s)]
*  Well, they show those things that are walking across golf courses and stuff. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3749.08s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3751.08s)]
*  These are way scarier, because crocodiles will eat you. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3752.08s)]
*  Alligators will leave you the fuck alone for the most part. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3754.08s)]
*  They could eat you. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3756.08s)]
*  They might eat you if you're swimming. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3757.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3758.08s)]
*  But crocodiles will go after you. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3759.08s)]
*  Like, they eat people. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3760.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3762.08s)]
*  Like, crocodiles in Africa, the Nile crocodiles that we're talking about, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3763.08s)]
*  my friend Jim Schakey, he's a professional hunter, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3766.08s)]
*  they sent him to Africa to kill these crocodiles, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3769.08s)]
*  because they were killing so many villagers. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3773.08s)]
*  Everyone in the villagers was, like, missing a hand. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3775.08s)]
*  Is that the one where the boat turns over? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3777.08s)]
*  Is that those crocodiles in the boat, and they just keep pulling the boat down? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3778.08s)]
*  That was the guy in a kayak. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3781.08s)]
*  Yeah, that was in some magazine. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3783.08s)]
*  He's just going along, and then it flips it over. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3785.08s)]
*  Yeah, the crocodile swam up to the kayak, flipped it over, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3789.08s)]
*  and pulled him out of the kayak and swallowed him whole. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3792.08s)]
*  But what else? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3794.08s)]
*  Legs were still in there, he was pulling it out, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3795.08s)]
*  the kayak just keeps sinking, like, has been chewed alive. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3796.08s)]
*  Bro, they are monsters. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3799.08s)]
*  They are monsters. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3802.08s)]
*  And here's the crazy thing. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3803.08s)]
*  The pythons are such monsters that they're eating the alligators. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3804.08s)]
*  D'oh. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3807.08s)]
*  Pythons, they found a dead python with a 12-foot alligator inside of its body. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3808.08s)]
*  Oh, I just saw that. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3813.08s)]
*  It's bananas. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3814.08s)]
*  Yeah, they, I mean... [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3815.08s)]
*  That thing thought it could eat... [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3816.08s)]
*  I don't know how big the alligator was. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3817.08s)]
*  I might have exaggerated the size of the alligator. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3818.08s)]
*  It's a good place to get rid of a body, the glades. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3819.08s)]
*  That's where those... [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3821.08s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3822.08s)]
*  No one's walking by it. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3823.08s)]
*  No one's walking by it. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3824.08s)]
*  No one's walking by it. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3825.08s)]
*  That's where those kids from that bully movie, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3826.08s)]
*  like, there was a true story of that, like, they dumped in the Everglades, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3828.08s)]
*  and the only reason they got caught is because they were young, dumb teenagers [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3830.08s)]
*  who just kept telling people. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3833.08s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3835.08s)]
*  They just kept telling people. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3836.08s)]
*  Like, one person would go, he goes, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3837.08s)]
*  all right, don't tell anybody else, but like, we all killed the bully yesterday. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3838.08s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3841.08s)]
*  Of course they did. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3842.08s)]
*  And they couldn't stop telling. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3843.08s)]
*  That's my favorite. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3844.08s)]
*  That movie is made by that Larry Clark guy who makes all of the... [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3846.08s)]
*  Gummo? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3850.08s)]
*  Yes, like Gummo, like those kind of Harmony Corrine type guys. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3851.08s)]
*  They make all those, like, shitty kid movies. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3854.08s)]
*  And so the movie's made to be... [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3858.08s)]
*  It's very sexually explicit. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3860.08s)]
*  It's a very attractive cast. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3862.08s)]
*  And then when you look into the story at all, and they show it, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3864.08s)]
*  it's like a fat Samoan guy. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3867.08s)]
*  Everyone's like a Florida pig that they thought they were gonna be. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3869.08s)]
*  I'm like, what are all these sexy kids fucking and killing each other for? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3872.08s)]
*  Nah! [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3876.08s)]
*  And they're just outcast, awful-looking people. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3877.08s)]
*  Yeah, the ones who are out there have no other options. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3880.08s)]
*  This is my friend group. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3882.08s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3883.08s)]
*  Michael Pitt was a character in that, that handsome little son of a bitch. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3884.08s)]
*  Bijou Phillips, Rachel Miner. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3887.08s)]
*  That's always weird when they have a movie [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3889.08s)]
*  and you see what the real person looked like, and then you see them. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3891.08s)]
*  Like, when... what's her face? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3894.08s)]
*  Catherine Zeta-Jones played Giselle de Blanco. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3896.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3900.08s)]
*  Giselle de Blanco, you know, the cocaine queen, that crazy bitch from... [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3901.08s)]
*  The godmother or whatever they call you. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3906.08s)]
*  Yeah, she was terrifying. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3907.08s)]
*  She was in those cocaine cowboys documentaries. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3908.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3910.08s)]
*  When then you see Catherine Zeta-Jones, perfect, hot as the fucking sun, playing her. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3911.08s)]
*  How about they couldn't... [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3916.08s)]
*  They do that scream where it just switches right at the end of Blow. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3917.08s)]
*  They couldn't, with movie makeup, and all the time in the world, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3921.08s)]
*  they couldn't make Johnny Depp as ugly as George Young. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3925.08s)]
*  They just couldn't do it. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3929.08s)]
*  He's too perfect. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3931.08s)]
*  He shines through everything. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3932.08s)]
*  He's too perfect. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3933.08s)]
*  So, somebody saw that in movie theaters, and they went to that picture of him. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3934.08s)]
*  Somebody went, throw mama from the train. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3937.08s)]
*  And they didn't realize he does absolutely look like throw mama from the train. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3939.08s)]
*  Mama Fratelli. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3943.08s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3944.08s)]
*  That's great. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3945.08s)]
*  Yeah, dude, he was really crazy. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3946.08s)]
*  And again, he was gorgeous Johnny Depp the whole movie. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3947.08s)]
*  Remember when they got that hot lady to play Monster? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3950.08s)]
*  What's her name? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3953.08s)]
*  Charlize Theron. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3954.08s)]
*  Do you think the rest of Hollywood is like, can you just hire one of the ugly ones? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3955.08s)]
*  They never have to. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3958.08s)]
*  No one fights for the ugly people to get their roles. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3959.08s)]
*  Why are you hiring pretties to play our roles? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3962.08s)]
*  She has to get gross to do this. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3964.08s)]
*  Who is it put on the movie for the Dark Knight? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3966.08s)]
*  Not the Dark Knight, the Batman. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3969.08s)]
*  The new Batman? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3971.08s)]
*  Was it Colin Farrell? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3972.08s)]
*  That handsome fella? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3974.08s)]
*  He was the penguin? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3975.08s)]
*  Oh, the penguin, yeah. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3976.08s)]
*  Yeah, see what they did with him? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3977.08s)]
*  What did he do? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3978.08s)]
*  He doesn't look any... [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3979.08s)]
*  Well, that's a good one. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3980.08s)]
*  But Charlize Theron actually turned herself ugly for that movie. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3981.08s)]
*  She's hot as fuck. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3984.08s)]
*  So hot. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3986.08s)]
*  She's hot as fuck. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3987.08s)]
*  I've seen her in real life. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3988.08s)]
*  She's fucking hot. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3989.08s)]
*  And she decided to gain like 100 pounds or whatever the fuck it is and shave her eyebrows off. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3990.08s)]
*  And make herself look like shit. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3995.08s)]
*  What did I ask you to look up? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3997.08s)]
*  Yeah, this guy. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=3999.08s)]
*  So he played the penguin. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4000.08s)]
*  He's a handsome fella. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4001.08s)]
*  And they put some crazy shit on him and got rid of his hair and made his face prosthetic. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4002.08s)]
*  Give him like a fat face. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4008.08s)]
*  Like that's him in the penguin. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4010.08s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't look anything like himself. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4011.08s)]
*  But that's just prosthetics. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4013.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4014.08s)]
*  Charlize Theron just did it. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4015.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4016.08s)]
*  Big difference. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4017.08s)]
*  Big difference. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4018.08s)]
*  Those people that do that, like for a movie... [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4019.08s)]
*  Like the machinist when he got became like an anorexic. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4020.08s)]
*  Damn. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4023.08s)]
*  Killing Tom Hanks. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4024.08s)]
*  He has like, does he have like bad diabetes and shit from doing that? [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4025.08s)]
*  From what? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4028.08s)]
*  I think from like jumping up and down weights for characters. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4029.08s)]
*  Really? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4030.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4031.08s)]
*  I heard he got AIDS in Philadelphia. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4032.08s)]
*  No, that's not true, Ari. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4033.08s)]
*  Not the movie, just in the city. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4034.08s)]
*  That place is teeming with AIDS. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4037.08s)]
*  Yeah, he had a bad cheesesteak. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4039.08s)]
*  It was influential. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4041.08s)]
*  What is... [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4043.08s)]
*  Well, we're just Googling. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4044.08s)]
*  Oh, whether or not Tom Hanks really is a... has diabetes. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4046.08s)]
*  That doesn't make sense. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4050.08s)]
*  It would say kidney problems, maybe. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4052.08s)]
*  Maybe it's a... [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4054.08s)]
*  But I think his health has been like... [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4055.08s)]
*  Family history of diabetes. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4057.08s)]
*  Oh, he has a family history of diabetes. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4058.08s)]
*  So he's always had it. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4059.08s)]
*  Did he go up and down for roles a lot? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4061.08s)]
*  He would be thinner, yeah, for sure. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4063.08s)]
*  I mean, especially when he was a little older, when he did like Castaway and had to get like gaunt. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4065.08s)]
*  Well, I know McConaughey. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4069.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4070.08s)]
*  And then he's been like, have you... yeah. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4071.08s)]
*  When McConaughey did Dallas Buyers Club, he got fucked up. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4072.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4076.08s)]
*  That hurt him. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4077.08s)]
*  Yeah, that hurt him. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4078.08s)]
*  He had a hard time like recovering from that. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4079.08s)]
*  Like you're basically on Death's Door. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4082.08s)]
*  You know, you're letting your body eat itself. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4084.08s)]
*  That's what happens. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4086.08s)]
*  People don't realize how scary that is. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4087.08s)]
*  Like for a person to do that for a movie. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4090.08s)]
*  For a movie. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4092.08s)]
*  It's so inconsequential, really. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4093.08s)]
*  So crazy. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4094.08s)]
*  Just to entertain people for two hours. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4095.08s)]
*  Like what Homeboy did with the Machinists, Christian Bale. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4097.08s)]
*  He got to Death's Door, man. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4100.08s)]
*  You ever see that? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4102.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4103.08s)]
*  That was a wild one. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4104.08s)]
*  He looked so bad. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4105.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4106.08s)]
*  It was even worse than McConaughey did in Dallas Buyers Club. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4107.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4110.08s)]
*  It was scenes where he would take his shirt off and he was all spindly like that. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4111.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4113.08s)]
*  But he came and played Batman like six months later. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4114.08s)]
*  He got on the sauce. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4116.08s)]
*  Well, I mean, that was after American Psycho where he was like jacked. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4117.08s)]
*  Jacked, yeah. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4122.08s)]
*  But it's just that image of him in the Machinists. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4123.08s)]
*  Like that, with his arms are splayed by a bird. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4126.08s)]
*  He was so anorexic. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4129.08s)]
*  Yeah, that one. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4130.08s)]
*  Like dude, he looks like he's on Death's Door. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4131.08s)]
*  Like that looks like a person who's been starved in a concentration camp. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4133.08s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4136.08s)]
*  He must have been so proud of himself when he was doing that suck-in thing. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4137.08s)]
*  He was like, I made that. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4139.08s)]
*  It's very crazy to do. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4140.08s)]
*  But he seems to be okay with it. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4141.08s)]
*  But like I said, I know McConaughey really got hurt from Dallas Buyers Club. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4143.08s)]
*  He had a really hard time getting back from that. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4147.08s)]
*  Damn. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4149.08s)]
*  It's not a joke, man. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4150.08s)]
*  Your body's eating itself. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4151.08s)]
*  Like to do that for a movie. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4153.08s)]
*  So it's one thing to get fat. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4154.08s)]
*  Like Mark Wahlberg got fat for a movie recently. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4156.08s)]
*  Really? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4159.08s)]
*  Yeah, he just ate like fucking 30,000 cowers a day and he gained 30 pounds. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4160.08s)]
*  Big gut. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4162.08s)]
*  But then he lost it again. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4163.08s)]
*  So that's an old sketch. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4165.08s)]
*  That's not good for you. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4166.08s)]
*  But it's still probably better for you than almost dying of starvation. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4168.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's not that bad. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4172.08s)]
*  Like I'd rather be that. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4173.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4175.08s)]
*  And that you could fucking with this. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4176.08s)]
*  I mean, he's obviously a very disciplined guy. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4178.08s)]
*  He's going to lose the weight and get back. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4179.08s)]
*  Also, he's not that bad. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4181.08s)]
*  But it's not as dangerous. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4182.08s)]
*  Does he have a third nipple? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4183.08s)]
*  It's not good, though. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4184.08s)]
*  Does he? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4185.08s)]
*  I think he has a third nipple. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4186.08s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4187.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4188.08s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4189.08s)]
*  That's a third nipple. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4190.08s)]
*  No, I think it's a third nipple. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4191.08s)]
*  It's got an aerial. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4192.08s)]
*  When it's got the little white in the middle. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4193.08s)]
*  Come on. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4195.08s)]
*  It's a third nipple. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4196.08s)]
*  This is a conspiracy theory. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4197.08s)]
*  I had a friend in high school. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4198.08s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4199.08s)]
*  This is a conspiracy theory that is unfounded. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4200.08s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4201.08s)]
*  I bet looked it up. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4202.08s)]
*  I bet someone has said that before. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4203.08s)]
*  Unfounded conspiracy theories. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4204.08s)]
*  We've had the proof. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4205.08s)]
*  We cannot have those. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4206.08s)]
*  We saw the proof. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4207.08s)]
*  This is what the original. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4208.08s)]
*  Now, does Donnie have the same third nipple? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4209.08s)]
*  Is this a thing in the family? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4212.08s)]
*  Is that what Wahlbergers is made of? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4213.08s)]
*  That's a third nipple for sure. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4215.08s)]
*  It's got a third nipple. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4216.08s)]
*  It is a third nipple. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4217.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4218.08s)]
*  You already know this. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4219.08s)]
*  Good sign. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4220.08s)]
*  Martin Wahlberg's third nipple. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4221.08s)]
*  You knew. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4222.08s)]
*  No, I saw it. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4223.08s)]
*  You just saw it. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4224.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4225.08s)]
*  Would you assume that a vain man would get that removed or maybe that's the best one [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4226.08s)]
*  to suck on? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4229.08s)]
*  Ooh. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4230.08s)]
*  The most sensitive. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4231.08s)]
*  Maybe that little one is wild. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4232.08s)]
*  It's the god nipple. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4234.08s)]
*  Oh, like a clit nipple. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4235.08s)]
*  It tells the future. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4236.08s)]
*  Yeah, that one's the one. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4237.08s)]
*  Just rub it. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4238.08s)]
*  It's like when the teacher put his thumb on their head and made them go to X-ray. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4239.08s)]
*  Just tweak that one nipple. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4244.08s)]
*  I wonder if a third one has nipple reaction, like the tightening of the areole and the [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4248.08s)]
*  loosening up. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4252.08s)]
*  Sucks together. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4253.08s)]
*  Why is there never a full nipple? [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4254.08s)]
*  It's always just like left over. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4256.08s)]
*  Right, like an extra finger is not like the biggest finger. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4258.08s)]
*  The Danny DeVito nipple. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4260.08s)]
*  If you have two thumbs. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4261.08s)]
*  How would you know which one it is? [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4263.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4265.08s)]
*  Wait, yeah, maybe like, no, no, this is the fake nipple. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4266.08s)]
*  This was my second. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4269.08s)]
*  You know, if you lose a pinky, you lose like the majority of the power in your hand. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4270.08s)]
*  No. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4274.08s)]
*  Like a large amount. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4275.08s)]
*  I think it's something like 50 percent of the strength of your hand. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4276.08s)]
*  Imagine how strong it'd be if you had all index fingers, all index in this finger. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4278.08s)]
*  Like this is a bitch ass finger. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4284.08s)]
*  Yeah, pinky doesn't do much. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4285.08s)]
*  This little finger. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4286.08s)]
*  And it takes away 50 percent of your power. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4287.08s)]
*  This little finger works out all the fucking time. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4288.08s)]
*  It's still weak as fuck. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4289.08s)]
*  Look at this little bitch. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4290.08s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4291.08s)]
*  It's only good for making you look gay while you drink tea. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4292.08s)]
*  But these fingers are strong as fuck. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4294.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4296.08s)]
*  And that's like imagine if you had a hand of only these fingers. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4297.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4300.08s)]
*  Like what is this pinky doing? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4301.08s)]
*  How close are we to that? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4302.08s)]
*  Like is it, am I using that very often? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4303.08s)]
*  Do I need a dainty? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4305.08s)]
*  I can do dainty shit with these. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4306.08s)]
*  Why do I have a dainty little bitch ass finger? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4307.08s)]
*  It makes the base of my wiener feel thick. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4309.08s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4311.08s)]
*  Use. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4312.08s)]
*  Use. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4313.08s)]
*  There you go. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4314.08s)]
*  I tried to flip a bracelet. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4315.08s)]
*  That's it. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4316.08s)]
*  For guys who jerk off like this. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4317.08s)]
*  For propagation of the, yeah. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4318.08s)]
*  The taper down effect. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4319.08s)]
*  Gentle. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4320.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4321.08s)]
*  If you're a gentleman, you jerk off like you're drinking tea. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4322.08s)]
*  You pinky out. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4323.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4324.08s)]
*  Remember when this was the worst social thing you could do by accident? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4325.08s)]
*  Have a pinky out. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4326.08s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4327.08s)]
*  You're frantic. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4328.08s)]
*  You're frantic. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4329.08s)]
*  You're frantic. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4330.08s)]
*  You're frantic. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4331.08s)]
*  You're frantic. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4332.08s)]
*  You're frantic. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4333.08s)]
*  I'm like, oh no. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4334.08s)]
*  Your friends will mock you. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4335.08s)]
*  We saw that. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4336.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4337.08s)]
*  I think that might be just us. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4338.08s)]
*  That might be a comedian's thing. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4339.08s)]
*  That's how you're supposed to do it. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4340.26s)]
*  If regular guys are drinking coffee, I bet they do this all the time. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4341.64s)]
*  They don't even think about it. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4345.44s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4346.64s)]
*  They don't think someone's going to jump all over them and mock them. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4347.64s)]
*  Why would that be a problem? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4350.08s)]
*  The comedian, Pete Dominic, told me a story years ago in Vegas about, I don't know if [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4351.44s)]
*  it was somebody finding out that somebody else in the school jerked off different than [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4357.28s)]
*  everybody or him. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4361.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4362.18s)]
*  You know the rumor, those bullshit rumors that go around every school. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4364.18s)]
*  Some girl had a dog eat her pussy and someone jerked off in school or something. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4367.820000000001s)]
*  This was whatever got caught jerking off in school, whoever the kid was. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4373.12s)]
*  When everyone was making fun of them, they're like, ah, you see Steve was jerking off in [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4376.820000000001s)]
*  school. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4381.06s)]
*  He said one kid was like, yeah, Steve, you were jerking off. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4382.06s)]
*  That's when everyone just goes, hang on, Steve. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4386.46s)]
*  Wait. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4388.9400000000005s)]
*  What? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4389.9400000000005s)]
*  He was doing what? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4390.9400000000005s)]
*  Knuckles up saying you're doing, you fucking weirdo. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4391.94s)]
*  That's how you find out. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4394.54s)]
*  He goes, oh, you guys are jerking off. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4396.339999999999s)]
*  He was on top one second, on the bottom the next second. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4398.54s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4402.94s)]
*  Isn't that funny that we'll judge someone on the method they use to jerk off? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4403.94s)]
*  Yeah, like you're out of the group. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4409.54s)]
*  How weird is that? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4411.179999999999s)]
*  How weird is that this bothers you? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4412.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because you don't jerk off with anybody. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4413.86s)]
*  Why should it even matter? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4415.7s)]
*  It seems hyper aggressive. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4416.7s)]
*  I've seen it in pornography and it bothers me. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4418.419999999999s)]
*  I say, he's doing it wrong, which isn't true. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4422.46s)]
*  But if it works, I was a kid. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4425.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4428.179999999999s)]
*  To get you there, I'm like, nah, you don't even know the sweet, pure pleasure of going [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4429.179999999999s)]
*  the other way. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4432.62s)]
*  It's like a guy who's got an unorthodox pitch. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4433.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4435.54s)]
*  Also, though, he might like his pressure low. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4436.54s)]
*  Because again, we're talking about the pinky finger versus the ring finger. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4440.179999999999s)]
*  No, it would just lay off. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4443.7s)]
*  How low are we talking about? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4444.94s)]
*  I feel like if you're doing it this way, you're more fucking a hole that's empty on the other [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4446.74s)]
*  side where you can fuck the full pussy of your fist the other direction. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4451.38s)]
*  You could also just be rubbing the dick against your hand, no pressure, for slower. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4455.34s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4460.14s)]
*  Is it crazy to enjoy what you're doing? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4461.14s)]
*  No, what you're doing is crazy. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4462.62s)]
*  Like you're cradling it. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4463.62s)]
*  Yeah, you're cradling it. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4464.62s)]
*  That's what Rock the Cradle of Love was about. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4465.62s)]
*  I've heard stories of guys who's like their jerk off is to have their... [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4467.900000000001s)]
*  Slow down. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4472.54s)]
*  Fuck their own thigh in bed, basically. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4473.54s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4474.54s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4475.54s)]
*  That was me when I was little. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4476.54s)]
*  I would just rub it against my jeans. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4477.54s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4478.54s)]
*  Is that a restrict act they're going to get us for spreading bad information? [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4480.42s)]
*  That's bad information. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4483.18s)]
*  Why did they take away that? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4484.18s)]
*  Imagine if that fucking act passes through and they go through old podcasts. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4485.18s)]
*  Everybody's going to jail. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4488.3s)]
*  Oh boy, I'm fucked. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4489.3s)]
*  Everyone's going to jail. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4490.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4491.3s)]
*  If you said anything negative about a candidate. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4492.3s)]
*  Anything negative about the government. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4494.78s)]
*  Because it's still up, so it's still doing the thing. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4495.78s)]
*  Yeah, the whole thing is spooky, man. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4498.22s)]
*  It's spooky that they just keep wanting more and more control. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4500.1s)]
*  It's just like we were talking about with cult leaders. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4502.94s)]
*  It starts off, they're kind of okay, and then after a while they go crazy, and then they [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4505.14s)]
*  push it to see how far they can do it. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4509.42s)]
*  I think that's a pattern with human beings. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4511.1s)]
*  I think that's a pattern in the government. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4513.34s)]
*  I think that's a pattern in cults. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4515.02s)]
*  Comedy centuries do that when they were like, hey, this material, we own the material forever, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4516.62s)]
*  not just the recording. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4519.66s)]
*  And then you'd have to go, no. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4520.66s)]
*  And they're like, okay. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4521.66s)]
*  Well, we had to ask. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4522.66s)]
*  Yeah, try. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4523.66s)]
*  Yeah, and it's like, why even try? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4524.66s)]
*  Well, the problem is you're an artist. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4526.14s)]
*  And when you mix art with business, stuff gets very slippery. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4529.66s)]
*  I hate it. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4533.26s)]
*  I don't know how to do any of it. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4534.26s)]
*  Business. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4538.1s)]
*  Yeah, you're pretty much useless with that. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4539.1s)]
*  Yeah, but it's also one of the reasons why you're so fucking funny. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4543.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4546.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4547.860000000001s)]
*  I think it all goes together, man. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4548.860000000001s)]
*  I don't think those people that are really good at crunching numbers are the funniest [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4550.900000000001s)]
*  folks. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4554.62s)]
*  You should have seen this. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4555.62s)]
*  It was like, Jay, I need your notes on this edit. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4556.62s)]
*  And he's like, okay, well, I've got to see my daughter tomorrow. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4557.62s)]
*  So I'm like, Jay, put it on and watch it now. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4561.62s)]
*  I did not want to watch it. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4567.38s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4568.38s)]
*  I didn't want to do anything. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4569.38s)]
*  I did not want to watch it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4570.38s)]
*  Sometimes on the edits, it doesn't matter now. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4572.38s)]
*  It's out now and I've seen it and I'm very happy with it. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4574.58s)]
*  But sometimes I go, we need your notes on the edits. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4577.46s)]
*  And I'd go, and then I'd go to click the email to watch it again. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4580.099999999999s)]
*  And I would see Ari's copious notes, his wonderful notes. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4584.34s)]
*  And I would go, I'm almost one at random. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4588.58s)]
*  I go, I don't know how I feel about his third note, but I pretty much agree with all. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4591.58s)]
*  I was going to call you guys, but it's all pretty much that. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4594.74s)]
*  Yeah, let a friend edit it. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4597.58s)]
*  That's a good move. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4598.74s)]
*  He did eventually. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4599.74s)]
*  Someone who's a good editor, let a friend edit it. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4600.74s)]
*  Yeah, we got Carter to edit it. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4602.94s)]
*  Not a bad idea. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4604.139999999999s)]
*  He was right on everything you say. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4605.139999999999s)]
*  When he'd go, I don't know about this. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4607.26s)]
*  And I go, sure, you know better than I do. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4608.74s)]
*  Like, let's do it. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4611.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4612.139999999999s)]
*  Well, we set the club up so that he could film there all the time. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4613.139999999999s)]
*  We set the club up so there's three angles in every room. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4616.179999999999s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of specials. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4618.9s)]
*  Yeah, that's the goal. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4620.139999999999s)]
*  The goal is to let people, like, look, everybody knows now, and Ari, you're a great testament [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4621.46s)]
*  to that. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4626.5s)]
*  You need one fucking banging special on YouTube, and then you're off to the races. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4627.5s)]
*  People can see it. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4631.3s)]
*  It's legit. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4632.3s)]
*  Everyone hears everybody on podcasts. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4633.3s)]
*  Matt Edgar says this. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4634.3s)]
*  You introduce a friend on a podcast, say, hey, he's a really funny guy, really funny [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4635.3s)]
*  guy. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4637.62s)]
*  And then you're at home going, can you prove that? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4638.62s)]
*  Is there any proof of that out there? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4640.660000000001s)]
*  Well, at a certain point, they trust you. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4641.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, I've never lied once. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4644.06s)]
*  Like, I've had a lot of people that I really, I like them, but they're just not that funny. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4645.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4649.26s)]
*  I can't help you. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4650.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4652.14s)]
*  You know, it's like, whatever it is. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4653.14s)]
*  But when you put out a thing, it's not fun. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4655.42s)]
*  The thing about doing comedy as long as I have is seeing somebody who's seeing somebody, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4656.42s)]
*  especially when you like them and like a friend, you're like, oh, I don't know if you have [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4661.02s)]
*  like the basic. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4663.9800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4664.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, because even people- [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4665.9800000000005s)]
*  Basic what? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4667.3s)]
*  Like, habit? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4668.3s)]
*  Well, it's a good example. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4669.3s)]
*  I've been doing comedy longer than Louis and Dave from Skanks. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4670.3s)]
*  And like, when I was, you know, whatever, eight years in and they were just starting, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4676.18s)]
*  I'd watch them. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4684.06s)]
*  When they were eight years in, I'd watch them and they were funny on stage, but it wasn't [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4685.06s)]
*  like they, I saw it with like their lack of experience, wasn't it? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4691.22s)]
*  But I could see right away, I'm like, nah, but you guys have like- [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4694.740000000001s)]
*  You know what you're doing. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4697.06s)]
*  I wasn't worried about them. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4698.06s)]
*  I was like, you guys are going to be fine. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4699.06s)]
*  Like, you're a very funny guy. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4700.06s)]
*  I don't know what level they go to necessarily, but I was like, you'll be around comedy. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4701.34s)]
*  You're not a lunatic. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4706.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4707.38s)]
*  And then there's some people where you're like, damn, I love this guy. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4708.38s)]
*  Then you watch them and you go, oh, zero chance. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4709.38s)]
*  He's such a nice person. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4711.98s)]
*  There's a bunch of those. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4713.46s)]
*  Oh, this hurts. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4715.0599999999995s)]
*  It's unfortunate, you know, because sometimes you become friends with them before you see [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4716.0599999999995s)]
*  their set. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4719.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4720.139999999999s)]
*  And then you see them and they want to come on your podcast or they want to, you know, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4721.139999999999s)]
*  hey, you know, I know you're doing a show in Minneapolis. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4726.139999999999s)]
*  I'm actually from there. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4729.3s)]
*  I'd love to open for you. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4730.3s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4731.3s)]
*  We got a problem. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4732.3s)]
*  I just booked somebody. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4733.820000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4734.820000000001s)]
*  You kind of have to have a real conversation with them. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4735.820000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, it's going to keep coming up. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4736.820000000001s)]
*  But you got to kind of figure out a way to say it in a way that's. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4737.820000000001s)]
*  Fortunately, I haven't had to do that to too many people. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4740.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not that person. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4743.820000000001s)]
*  It's not even. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4746.820000000001s)]
*  Just take it. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4747.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'll absolutely take it. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4748.820000000001s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4750.820000000001s)]
*  I never asked someone if I could go with them on the road. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4751.820000000001s)]
*  I never did. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4753.820000000001s)]
*  And all the guys that I took on the road with me, I asked, you know, again, I'm not going [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4754.820000000001s)]

*  He was a dude that I knew at the club that was just starting out and I knew he had potential. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4761.34s)]
*  Like we I would see his late night sets and every now and then he hit a spark and I'd [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4766.34s)]
*  be like, ah, it was just like you were figuring it out. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4771.34s)]
*  And then I took you to Denver one time. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4775.34s)]
*  You've never murdered. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4778.34s)]
*  That was my first road thing. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4779.34s)]
*  Murdered. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4780.34s)]
*  The first time Ari was ever in front of the camera. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4781.34s)]
*  And then I took you to Denver one time. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4784.34s)]
*  You fucking murdered. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4786.34s)]
*  That was my first road thing. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4787.34s)]
*  Murdered. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4788.34s)]
*  And Ari was ever in front of 350 people who were so happy to see a show. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4789.860000000001s)]
*  It was like, what the fuck is comedy? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4793.860000000001s)]
*  Murdered. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4796.860000000001s)]
*  He murdered. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4797.860000000001s)]
*  That's a high bar set. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4798.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4801.860000000001s)]
*  Everybody shows up at ComedyWorks. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4802.860000000001s)]
*  It's my first show. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4803.860000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, they won't be as good as this. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4804.860000000001s)]
*  Well, you had been running with weights on, right? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4806.34s)]
*  Because you're in those late night spots where if you're a beginner and you're going on after [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4809.06s)]
*  like five killers in a row, the audience just leaves. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4813.34s)]
*  Big chunks of them leave and you get this like dead sort of. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4818.06s)]
*  All of my New York chops are. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4821.860000000001s)]
*  I followed David Tell to ComedySeller for 10 years, 12 years straight. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4824.34s)]
*  Every night. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4830.3s)]
*  Look what it did. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4831.3s)]
*  That's the only way. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4832.3s)]
*  But it's funny you almost say the same thing. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4833.3s)]
*  It was like, a tell asked me if I wanted to go on the road with him and start doing stuff. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4834.38s)]
*  And then he would call me to. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4839.700000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4840.9800000000005s)]
*  I would feel weird to go, hey, can I do whatever with you? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4841.9800000000005s)]
*  I would never ask anybody. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4844.620000000001s)]
*  No fucking way. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4845.9400000000005s)]
*  You can't ask. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4847.0199999999995s)]
*  Someone will ask you. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4848.5s)]
*  If you ask, it becomes a thing. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4849.5s)]
*  And now someone's not hiring you because they want to. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4851.46s)]
*  They're hiring you because you asked. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4854.299999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's not like we don't know you're a professional comedian. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4856.339999999999s)]
*  You know, if you ever need anybody is a funny one. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4859.82s)]
*  But I mean, how many people can you take on the road? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4862.74s)]
*  I can't find a comic. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4864.74s)]
*  What do you mean if I ever need one? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4865.74s)]
*  Also work that John Carden is a comic from here in Austin who he was in Phoenix before [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4866.74s)]

*  Did we have two shows? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4918.379999999999s)]
*  Maybe two in one night. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4919.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because we waited in a, no, it was another place. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4920.379999999999s)]
*  We waited in a turned out bus in between shows. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4922.179999999999s)]
*  It was dope. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4924.82s)]
*  They were like robust people. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4925.82s)]
*  Like I was impressed with them. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4928.179999999999s)]
*  Like everyone had character. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4929.66s)]
*  It was very interesting. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4930.86s)]
*  Anchorage is wild. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4932.26s)]
*  Anchorage is wild. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4933.26s)]
*  Like the level of character that the average guy has in Anchorage is above normal because [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4934.26s)]
*  they're around fucking moose and bears and it's frozen half the year. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4939.46s)]
*  They all carry candles in their car? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4944.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4946.58s)]
*  Because if it goes off they've got to light that and keep alive. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4947.58s)]
*  Blankets and candles. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4948.58s)]
*  You keep blankets and candles in your car. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4949.58s)]
*  Those, I used to go up to that. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4951.22s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4952.22s)]
*  That was one of the first places. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4953.22s)]
*  No way. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4954.22s)]
*  Fuck, dude. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4955.22s)]
*  That was one of the first places that Chilkooch Charlie's out there that would headline [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4956.22s)]
*  me every year. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4959.42s)]
*  So before I was almost going anywhere in like the lower 48, I was like a regular there. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4960.42s)]
*  Every year I would go they would have me. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4966.26s)]
*  I loved that place. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4967.26s)]
*  I love Alaska. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4968.26s)]
*  The chaos of that particular place, Chilkooch Charlie's, was insane. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4969.26s)]
*  It was like a powder keg that never went off. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4972.660000000001s)]
*  It was a hip hop room, an electronic dance club upstairs. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4976.740000000001s)]
*  Downstairs like a honky tonk band. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4982.02s)]
*  And then they have another room that might have like a pretty big actual like metal band. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4984.94s)]
*  I think Godsmack had played there at one point. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4989.339999999999s)]
*  It's like a couple hundred people. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4991.54s)]
*  And it was, it looked like a log cabin from outside. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4993.139999999999s)]
*  Like very unassuming. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4995.58s)]
*  One of my favorite guys I ever interviewed on the show is this guy John Reeves who owns [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=4996.58s)]
*  a place called the Boneyard in Alaska. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5000.9s)]
*  And this place in Alaska is this one spot that for whatever reason has tons and tons [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5004.0199999999995s)]
*  of bones. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5010.78s)]
*  Giant woolly mammoth tusks. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5011.78s)]
*  They've found animals from that area that weren't even supposed to be living there. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5014.18s)]
*  These different fucking lions and cats and bears and all these, I mean insane amounts. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5018.3s)]
*  And it's a small area. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5024.62s)]
*  It's just a few acres. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5026.08s)]
*  And he's got other areas on his, he has an enormous property. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5027.54s)]
*  He's like a mining guy. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5030.9400000000005s)]
*  He's very wealthy but like down to earth. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5033.38s)]
*  Like a regular dude. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5037.02s)]
*  Smokes cigarettes on the podcast. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5038.26s)]
*  He's a fun fucking dude. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5039.780000000001s)]
*  So he tells a story about how they dumped a bunch of fossils in the East River because [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5041.82s)]
*  they didn't have any storage from them. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5046.259999999999s)]
*  Fossils that came from his land. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5048.58s)]
*  And so he was trying to get it back and he got all these, this paperwork that shows where [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5050.98s)]
*  it was dumped. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5055.54s)]
*  So then he gives it out to the internet on the podcast. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5056.54s)]
*  So then these guys start swimming around in the fucking river, in the East River. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5059.0s)]
*  And one of them finds a step bison jawbone. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5063.3s)]
*  So it's proof that some of that stuff did get into the East River. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5067.38s)]
*  At least that piece did. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5072.02s)]
*  So this guy finds it diving, looking around the bottom of the East River in that fucking [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5073.58s)]
*  toxic river. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5077.78s)]
*  It's his. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5078.78s)]
*  And they pull out this thing. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5079.78s)]
*  So he pulls out this thing. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5081.86s)]
*  Ew his lips are exposed in that shit. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5082.86s)]
*  Yeah man. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5085.78s)]
*  His lips. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5086.78s)]
*  Well he had the scuba thing on before. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5087.78s)]
*  See he's got the thing that goes on his mouth. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5088.9400000000005s)]
*  He took it off when he got out of the water. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5092.0s)]
*  But that's a step bison jawbone. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5093.34s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5096.46s)]
*  I'm not assuming by the way. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5097.46s)]
*  I would be like. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5098.46s)]
*  Well that's a piece of it. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5099.46s)]
*  This isn't money. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5100.46s)]
*  It looks like when you see the full version that lady has it in her hand. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5101.46s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5106.14s)]
*  Go back. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5107.14s)]
*  See the full version? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5108.14s)]
*  That lady has it in her hand. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5109.14s)]
*  That's what it looks like when it's fully connected. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5110.14s)]
*  So that was a deceased bison's jawbone. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5111.58s)]
*  So they have a shit ton of those out in this bone yard. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5115.36s)]
*  And this is something that they found in the East River. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5118.82s)]
*  So what his story, it seems at least to be proved correct. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5122.58s)]
*  That someone at one point in time dumped a bunch of these priceless fossils into the [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5127.38s)]
*  East River. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5133.5s)]
*  Because they didn't have any storage. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5134.5s)]
*  In like the 1930s was it? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5135.5s)]
*  Was it something like that? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5136.5s)]
*  It was like the 1930s or something. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5137.5s)]
*  I remember that was much later. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5138.5s)]
*  For some reason because U-Haul Bill was up. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5139.5s)]
*  Marshall's here. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5142.5s)]
*  I think back then they didn't even understand. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5143.5s)]
*  We got a bunch of these. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5145.5s)]
*  Fucking dump them. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5146.5s)]
*  Dump them. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5147.5s)]
*  They didn't understand how crazy it was what they had. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5148.5s)]
*  One of the times I was in Alaska they took me and Dave Smith actually to the animal preserve [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5149.5s)]
*  area out there by the glaciers. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5155.299999999999s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, being a person who really mostly saw wild animals only in a zoo [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5156.82s)]
*  before, the animals there, while majestic, are pretty worse for the wear. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5162.78s)]
*  Like when you see a moose it's not like a beautiful, it is. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5168.7s)]
*  But when you get up to them there's scabs. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5173.339999999999s)]
*  Like they've been in a fight or something. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5175.339999999999s)]
*  They were nursing an eagle back to health. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5178.58s)]
*  Real wilderness animals are like fucking, they're living a life. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5180.38s)]
*  They don't live long either man. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5184.38s)]
*  Yeah, their shit's around all the time. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5185.38s)]
*  Did you see that video of these two dirt bike riders and one of them fucks up and rides [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5186.38s)]
*  his dirt bike past a bear's den and doesn't realize it until the bear comes charging out [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5193.26s)]
*  of the den at him? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5199.78s)]
*  No. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5201.42s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5202.42s)]
*  Let me find it, Jamie. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5203.42s)]
*  You got it? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5204.42s)]
*  You got it. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5205.42s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5206.42s)]
*  What Jamie? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5207.42s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5208.42s)]
*  10 bucks an hour. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5209.42s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5210.42s)]
*  Bro. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5211.42s)]
*  Are you fucking kidding me? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5212.42s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5214.22s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5215.22s)]
*  Oh he crashed him right there. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5216.22s)]
*  Yeah, look at this. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5218.74s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5220.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5222.9800000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5223.9800000000005s)]
*  That guy revved his engine and that's probably what scared it off. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5224.9800000000005s)]
*  The buddy's video statement. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5228.62s)]
*  Dude, that is death. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5229.9400000000005s)]
*  That is death. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5231.82s)]
*  Oh, did you know how fucking terrifying that was? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5232.82s)]
*  When they show that like people have been hit by like tiger claws. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5235.54s)]
*  I saw a video the other day, it was like family was attacked by, maybe it was a panther or [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5237.9800000000005s)]
*  something or a puma or something like that. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5242.86s)]
*  It looks like when you see the hits, it almost looks like they're playful playing with you. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5246.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's so powerful. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5250.46s)]
*  But this from a tiger would just rip your face entirely off. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5251.46s)]
*  It's clean off. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5254.46s)]
*  It's like Tyson trying to pity-peddy. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5255.46s)]
*  You don't understand. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5256.46s)]
*  You literally don't have any weapons. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5257.46s)]
*  They have weapons on every hand and their face is a weapon and their bite strength is [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5261.179999999999s)]
*  so superior to yours you couldn't even imagine it and they're so much stronger pound for [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5266.74s)]
*  pound than we are. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5272.42s)]
*  And you're just playing defense? [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5273.42s)]
*  You're not trying to win, you're trying to survive. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5274.42s)]
*  Did you ever have a regular house cat that you have a situation with? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5275.42s)]
*  It starts like swinging at you. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5280.58s)]
*  I had a house cat that was feral and I had to get him fixed because he was pissing in [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5282.740000000001s)]
*  my house. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5286.54s)]
*  It was one of those things. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5287.54s)]
*  He was just spraying all over my house. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5288.54s)]
*  He was feral. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5289.900000000001s)]
*  I got him when he was a kitten. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5290.900000000001s)]
*  So like a friend, she found a bunch of them underneath the apartment building and her [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5292.22s)]
*  and her boyfriend gave them out to people and I took one of them. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5296.46s)]
*  So I had this kitten and I had to literally I had to stay with it for several days alone [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5299.02s)]
*  in one of the bedrooms in my house to get it to be comfortable enough with me that it [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5305.1s)]
*  would let me touch it. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5308.46s)]
*  I would go near it and it would hiss at me. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5309.46s)]
*  Climb the fucking drapes. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5312.540000000001s)]
*  It was wild. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5313.540000000001s)]
*  Why did you take it home? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5314.540000000001s)]
*  Because I was committed to this. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5315.540000000001s)]
*  I was like I'm going to make this work out. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5316.540000000001s)]
*  And so these cats, when they start pissing in the house, you have to get them fixed because [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5319.620000000001s)]
*  now they're going to do that all the time. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5325.860000000001s)]
*  I had to get them right when he first started doing it. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5327.5s)]
*  I saw him do it. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5329.42s)]
*  He lifted up his ass and he sprayed all over my bathroom like you little motherfucker. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5330.42s)]
*  So I call my veterinarian and he says, how feral? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5335.06s)]
*  I go he's fucking crazy feral. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5338.14s)]
*  I go I'm the only one who can pet him. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5340.58s)]
*  And he's like oh my God. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5342.14s)]
*  He's my friend. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5343.62s)]
*  He's Dr. Craig. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5344.62s)]
*  He was the shit. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5345.62s)]
*  And so he goes you're going to have to capture it. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5347.5s)]
*  So I got it in the bathroom and it's hissing at me and jumping on the counters like it [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5349.58s)]
*  knows I'm doing something. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5354.14s)]
*  And so I throw a blanket over this fucking thing. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5355.9s)]
*  And I wrap him up in a blanket and I put him in a hamper and I take him to the doctor. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5358.62s)]
*  And I'm like good luck. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5364.94s)]
*  You can have the hamper in the back. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5365.94s)]
*  Good luck. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5369.259999999999s)]
*  He calls me when the operation's over because it was right down the street from my house. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5370.259999999999s)]
*  How did you do it? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5374.9s)]
*  I go how did you do it? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5375.9s)]
*  He's like we managed. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5377.299999999999s)]
*  It was not easy. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5378.299999999999s)]
*  He's like Jesus fucking Christ. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5379.299999999999s)]
*  I go I know. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5381.299999999999s)]
*  He was a fun guy. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5382.299999999999s)]
*  He would say Jesus fucking Christ. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5383.299999999999s)]
*  I go yeah he's feral. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5385.82s)]
*  But I could pick him up. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5388.62s)]
*  I could pick him up and he would purr. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5389.62s)]
*  Like purr louder than any cat ever purred. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5392.46s)]
*  Like so happy that he was okay. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5394.58s)]
*  He was safe. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5396.34s)]
*  Like programmed in his mind when he was a bitty bitty tiny baby was like the world is [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5397.62s)]
*  a scary place for a feral cat. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5402.179999999999s)]
*  The world is a scary place for that. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5404.66s)]
*  You still have the cat? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5406.139999999999s)]
*  No he's dead now. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5407.139999999999s)]
*  But became completely domesticated. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5408.139999999999s)]
*  Not really. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5409.94s)]
*  So there's no shit. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5410.94s)]

*  Really? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5412.94s)]
*  Yeah it was it. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5413.94s)]
*  No one else could touch him. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5415.74s)]
*  I could go up to him and go come on man come on. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5417.139999999999s)]
*  And I'd pick him up and he'd be alright. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5419.099999999999s)]

*  But it's fun. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5511.14s)]
*  I never had that kind of feeling with an animal before. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5512.14s)]
*  It's totally different. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5514.18s)]
*  But imagine asking a six month old child to figure that out. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5515.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5518.18s)]
*  But they can't get onto the table. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5519.18s)]
*  That's the thing is that the dogs can move. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5521.18s)]
*  Incredibly agile for a six month old. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5523.1s)]
*  Yeah they're fucking awesome. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5526.54s)]
*  I'm trying to fucking cook. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5527.54s)]
*  He's on the grill. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5529.54s)]
*  Literally on the grill and he's jumping up trying to get it. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5530.54s)]
*  But wouldn't you? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5533.18s)]
*  Everybody loves you. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5534.94s)]
*  You're a puppy. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5535.94s)]
*  Wouldn't you think that that's yours? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5536.94s)]
*  I'm going to get that food. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5537.94s)]
*  That fucking hot dog smells delicious. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5538.94s)]
*  It smells like something I like. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5539.94s)]
*  Imagine what a hot dog smells like to a dog. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5540.94s)]
*  Hot dog smells good to you. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5543.94s)]
*  Imagine what it smells like to a dog. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5544.94s)]
*  It must be unstoppable. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5546.5s)]
*  Because dog food doesn't smell good. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5548.0199999999995s)]
*  Does not. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5550.14s)]
*  And they get one with nuts. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5551.14s)]
*  It's grotesque. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5552.14s)]
*  But I'll tell you what I bought. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5553.14s)]
*  So they started opening dispensaries now in New York. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5554.14s)]
*  When I was in line they got CBD dog treats. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5557.580000000001s)]
*  And I mean it's so fun. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5563.06s)]
*  Taking them away now a little bit more because it's addictive to me how fun it is. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5567.42s)]
*  Because you can give her this thing. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5572.02s)]
*  If you give her a whole biscuit, which is by the way the servings, you give them a, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5574.14s)]
*  she's like a dog treat. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5577.18s)]
*  Looks like a little bone or whatever. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5578.18s)]
*  She eats, she takes it like a ritual. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5580.42s)]
*  She takes it over to a certain spot and like chomps on it, drops some of it, picks it up. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5581.900000000001s)]
*  And then you're almost like, she doesn't seem like anything. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5586.46s)]
*  And then 15 minutes later she starts aimlessly walking around the living room. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5589.22s)]
*  And then it's just a drop out into sleep wherever she's at and just like down. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5593.54s)]
*  And like if you try to wake her up, like hey Dawkins. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5598.22s)]
*  She really does like the one eye, like the bloodshot eye. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5601.9400000000005s)]
*  What's gonna happen? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5604.22s)]
*  What? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5605.22s)]
*  And I'm like man that shit. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5606.22s)]
*  I've never seen something work so much. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5608.22s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5610.860000000001s)]
*  I wonder if it's, how it affects them. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5612.02s)]
*  They're just chill. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5614.900000000001s)]
*  And by the way, she stopped falling asleep. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5616.54s)]
*  So that's why I said I was pulling them away. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5618.74s)]
*  Because she's not falling asleep. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5620.58s)]
*  She's getting used to, she's staying awake, but she's being loopy. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5622.78s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5625.5s)]
*  She's like just looking at you weird. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5626.94s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5628.58s)]
*  I think dogs can definitely get high. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5629.58s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5631.54s)]
*  You know how I know? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5632.54s)]
*  Because, do you remember my dog Lucy? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5633.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5634.54s)]
*  She was the dog that I had, there was a rescue dog. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5635.54s)]
*  Some friends of mine, they found this dog that was eaten out of garbage cans and they [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5638.66s)]
*  said she's so sweet, but she's covered in mange. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5642.5s)]
*  So I said, oh, okay. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5646.1s)]
*  You even go hunting for your dogs. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5647.9s)]
*  I just went, no! [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5649.14s)]
*  It's like somebody called me up with a terrible sob story. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5650.14s)]
*  They know I'm a pussy. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5652.9s)]
*  And so I had to, I see this dog and she's so sweet. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5654.26s)]
*  And she has mange all over her body. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5657.26s)]
*  And so I took her in. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5659.1s)]
*  And just feeding her, like within a short amount of time, the mange like completely [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5660.66s)]
*  went away. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5665.9s)]
*  And she was a great dog. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5666.9s)]
*  But one day, Joey Diaz and I were doing bong hits in my office. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5668.58s)]
*  And the dog was under the desk. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5673.14s)]
*  And I didn't think about it. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5675.219999999999s)]
*  We were just, there's actually a photo on the internet of Joey with a sleeveless shirt [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5677.259999999999s)]
*  on, holding a big handful of weed. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5682.179999999999s)]
*  It's from that day. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5685.42s)]
*  See if you can find that picture, because it's a famous picture. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5686.42s)]
*  That's the picture. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5690.139999999999s)]
*  So that's me and Joey. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5691.139999999999s)]
*  That's me and Joey in my office doing bong hits. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5695.259999999999s)]
*  You know, I bought like an ounce of weed. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5699.62s)]
*  So look at that. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5701.179999999999s)]
*  That was back when I was buying weed from the dispensary in Irvine. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5702.5s)]
*  Or in, oh fuck. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5707.38s)]
*  When there's like two of them? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5709.06s)]
*  What was the, it was a bad neighborhood. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5710.34s)]
*  I'm trying to remember the neighborhood. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5713.06s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5714.18s)]
*  I forgot. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5715.18s)]
*  I'll remember, I'll remember. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5716.38s)]
*  But so that was the day. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5717.54s)]
*  So we'd got there and gotten just fucking barbecued. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5719.58s)]
*  And the dog was underneath the desk. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5722.9400000000005s)]
*  And then she was so sketched out afterwards. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5725.26s)]
*  I was like, you okay? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5728.06s)]
*  But she had all this trauma from when she was young and she was homeless and eating [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5729.14s)]
*  out of garbage cans and shit with names. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5733.18s)]
*  She's on joints again. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5734.820000000001s)]
*  Back on the shit. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5735.820000000001s)]
*  It all came back. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5736.820000000001s)]
*  But I guess dogs like that are probably terrified they're going to go back to that life. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5737.820000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5741.14s)]
*  You start getting paranoid. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5742.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5743.14s)]
*  You're terrified you're going to be on the streets again. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5744.14s)]
*  Why do you bring the friend over? [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5745.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5746.14s)]
*  Well it's got to be to take me away. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5747.14s)]
*  But imagine a dog not having any idea why all of a sudden it's like hyper freaked out [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5748.14s)]
*  about everything. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5752.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5753.540000000001s)]
*  The senses in general I've never witnessed before. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5754.540000000001s)]
*  I'm blown away by like she like friends of ours who have dogs that she like is with a [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5756.7s)]
*  lot if we're like like Justin's house. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5761.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5764.86s)]
*  He's got a dog they play all the time. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5765.86s)]
*  If we're blocks away but in the area of town like Justin she perks up like the dog. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5766.86s)]
*  I don't know what it is like. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5773.94s)]
*  It seems like an impossibility but she tends to seem like recognize the car just like being [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5775.38s)]
*  down in the car. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5780.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5781.46s)]
*  I know it's not seeing like from smell or some she's like pops up like we're near that [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5782.46s)]
*  dog. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5785.139999999999s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5786.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5787.58s)]
*  Well I mean I don't know how else she could possibly fit you know I mean she's like down [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5788.58s)]
*  it'd be a pretty crazy coincidence. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5791.62s)]
*  Weird connection with people. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5794.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5795.3s)]
*  It's very weird. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5796.3s)]
*  Bandit led us to Sal's front door from the elevator after six months gone when she wasn't [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5797.3s)]
*  even she was six months old to a year old and then remember where Sal lived. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5802.3s)]
*  Dude my dog cuddles with me when I watch TV sometimes like he lies next to me and he puts [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5806.38s)]
*  his head on my chest. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=5811.820000000001s)]

*  So it's not crazy. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6619.700000000001s)]
*  The wait time for the doors to close. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6621.860000000001s)]
*  Everything just added up and the whole documentary came around to like, ah, she was just a whack [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6623.620000000001s)]
*  job, jumped in a shh. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6627.1s)]
*  Yeah, I know that. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6628.1s)]
*  She got off her meds. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6629.1s)]
*  Her family knew that she was medicated. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6630.1s)]
*  She decided to go to downtown LA and stay in this wacky hotel. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6632.3s)]
*  I think that's how I jumped off of her vise. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6635.5s)]
*  While they're doing all of that research and trying to figure out the investigation, when [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6637.38s)]
*  they came with that answer, her family was like, yeah, that adds up. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6642.9800000000005s)]
*  She'd probably get naked and jump into a pool. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6647.02s)]
*  She's done that kind of stuff before. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6648.820000000001s)]

*  They were like, oh, right. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6653.3s)]
*  Yeah, that does. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6654.3s)]

*  It was awesome. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6694.46s)]
*  Look at your hair, you sexy bitch. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6695.46s)]
*  I know. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6697.46s)]
*  It's poor Ari. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6698.46s)]
*  Ari thought, it just grew out and I've been on the road so much I haven't been able to [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6699.46s)]
*  get it done. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6704.02s)]
*  Again, red. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6705.02s)]
*  And Ari didn't know that. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6706.02s)]
*  And when he showed up in the town today, he red streets the side of his hair. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6707.02s)]
*  I did this in the morning of the flight. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6710.02s)]
*  That's like a solidarity, funny sign. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6711.02s)]
*  Blended with him. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6712.02s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6713.02s)]
*  And I don't have it. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6714.02s)]
*  Oh. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6715.02s)]
*  Well, I like it, Ari. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6716.02s)]
*  I'm not such a fan. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6717.02s)]
*  No? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6718.02s)]
*  How come? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6719.02s)]
*  I think you started shaving your whole head, bro. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6720.660000000001s)]
*  Off. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6724.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6725.06s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6726.06s)]
*  Shave that nonsense on the side anyway. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6727.06s)]
*  I got a bad toupee. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6728.06s)]
*  It doesn't look that bad. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6729.06s)]
*  You gotta let it go. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6730.06s)]
*  But yeah, when David Lucas made fun of you, you hated it since. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6731.06s)]
*  It's not how I normally wear this hair. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6734.860000000001s)]
*  David Lucas is so funny roasting. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6737.34s)]
*  When Tony goes after each other. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6739.38s)]
*  Oh my God, they go after each other. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6741.3s)]
*  It's as hard as I ever laugh. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6743.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6744.780000000001s)]
*  Because someone has to be really killing, but they'll do it for like five minutes. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6745.780000000001s)]
*  For five minutes, you're just holding your side where they go back and forth at each [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6750.94s)]
*  other off the cuff. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6753.62s)]
*  They're great. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6754.62s)]
*  Man, they must be sitting around all, I know Tony does. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6755.62s)]
*  I bet all day Monday, he's sitting around smoking pot, trying to think of things he [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6759.0599999999995s)]
*  could say to David Lucas. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6763.78s)]
*  And then also come up with some, yeah, for sure. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6765.459999999999s)]
*  I guarantee he's doing that little psycho. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6769.419999999999s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6771.98s)]
*  Every week, they probably both do it. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6772.98s)]
*  They probably sit around and think of what kind of mean shit they're going to say to [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6774.299999999999s)]
*  each other. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6776.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6777.78s)]
*  Instinctually, when I see David now, like if I'm doing Kill Tony and I see he's going [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6779.58s)]
*  to go on, I start right away just looking at everything on him just to be like, all [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6784.259999999999s)]
*  right, what can I have something? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6787.139999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to say something about my hair or my wallet chain or something. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6788.139999999999s)]
*  He's the best at that. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6793.219999999999s)]
*  Him and Tony are the fucking perfect combination. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6794.9s)]
*  He smokes a vape the way Mooney used to drink like champagnes. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6796.74s)]
*  He's just like, he's always too good to talk about you. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6799.259999999999s)]
*  He's casual. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6803.74s)]
*  Mooney was the king of casual with that little tiny bottle of champagne. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6805.98s)]
*  Oh bitch, please. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6809.78s)]
*  And he would take a sip of the champagne. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6810.78s)]
*  He would hit punch lines and take a sip of the champagne. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6812.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6815.66s)]
*  Paul Mooney. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6816.66s)]
*  That was hilarious. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6817.66s)]
*  Paul Mooney, man. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6818.66s)]
*  That was the funniest realization I've ever had of like I should have known all along [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6819.66s)]
*  on Paul Mooney being gay was that standing outside of Caroline's and I'm just like facing [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6825.459999999999s)]
*  away from the building and someone said, they were like, oh, this time there's a story, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6830.78s)]
*  something that happened with him. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6834.98s)]
*  His boyfriend or something was mad at him. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6836.62s)]
*  Paul Mooney's boyfriend. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6838.78s)]

*  Paul Mooney's gay? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6841.78s)]
*  And then they turned me around and it's his head shot. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6844.78s)]
*  He's got little circle glasses, a hat that has fringes on it and it's tied around his [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6847.7s)]
*  chin. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6852.0599999999995s)]
*  I was like, oh, yup, there it is. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6853.0599999999995s)]
*  He's gay the whole time. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6857.379999999999s)]
*  It was wild seeing him on stage before. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6859.0599999999995s)]
*  You like look at him. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6860.54s)]
*  My brother was like, how come it only talks about the one thing and not at all about the [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6862.259999999999s)]
*  other thing? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6864.86s)]
*  It was nuts. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6865.86s)]
*  Yeah, he never really did. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6866.86s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6869.94s)]
*  Well, in the era that he came up, you got to remember he was one of Pryor's guys. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6870.94s)]
*  He was one of Pryor's writers. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6873.9s)]
*  He was a writer. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6877.86s)]
*  He was a great comic. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6880.62s)]
*  He really was. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6882.62s)]
*  But I don't think he ever got his due. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6884.219999999999s)]
*  No, white people didn't know him. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6886.62s)]
*  I didn't know he was until comedy. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6888.219999999999s)]
*  He was the guy at the comedy store that when he would go on stage, especially after something [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6891.14s)]
*  happened, he always had material on it. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6896.860000000001s)]
*  Really good material. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6900.06s)]
*  He always was like anytime some shit went down, Paul Mooney wrote something. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6901.06s)]
*  He had a bit about the Spirit Airlines crash. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6906.3s)]
*  No, it wasn't Spirit Airlines. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6908.34s)]
*  It was some janky airlines that crashed into the swamp. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6909.780000000001s)]
*  He was talking about this woman clutching her purse while the alligator's eating her. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6913.38s)]
*  It was such a funny bit, man. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6919.18s)]
*  It was right after it happened. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6923.06s)]
*  Right after it happened. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6925.62s)]
*  He set it up. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6926.62s)]
*  It was masterfully the way he set it up. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6927.62s)]
*  So, it was just laughing at these victims. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6930.26s)]
*  I love it. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6933.02s)]
*  It was so good. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6934.02s)]
*  It was so good. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6935.02s)]
*  It was right after the tragedy. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6936.18s)]
*  So you know, whatever you feel about tasteless jokes after tragedies, the fact that this [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6937.9800000000005s)]
*  guy went up and did that like a day later and it was funny as fuck. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6944.18s)]
*  It was really funny. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6949.740000000001s)]
*  Do you think he didn't get his due ultimately because of his personality or do you think [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6951.3s)]
*  his personality developed because of not getting his due? [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6955.740000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6958.5s)]
*  I've met him several times and even done shows with him at Caroline's years ago and he was [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6959.5s)]
*  never very nice at all. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6964.26s)]
*  Mooney has a crust that you have to get through to get his trust. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6965.740000000001s)]
*  Once you get his trust, he is very kind. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6969.740000000001s)]
*  You have to compliment him. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6971.46s)]
*  I saw him talk to an HBO guy in the back. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6972.74s)]
*  It wasn't just that man. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6974.74s)]
*  He had to respect you. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6975.74s)]
*  Mooney was like, he'd been around a long time. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6978.74s)]
*  He'd seen a lot of shit. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6982.46s)]
*  He was a part of Richard Pryor's golden age and now here he is in the year 2005 hanging [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6983.78s)]
*  out with me and Ari. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6989.22s)]
*  It was a long time. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6990.22s)]
*  He saw some guy from HBO and he's like, Paul, how you been? [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6992.22s)]
*  Just a fucking fake, like all of them. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6994.78s)]
*  He goes, how you been? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6996.9800000000005s)]
*  I was like, I've been good. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6997.9800000000005s)]
*  How about you? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6998.9800000000005s)]
*  Wasn't even playing pretend. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=6999.9800000000005s)]
*  He just kept going, we've got to do something. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7001.5s)]
*  I was like, do we? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7005.5s)]
*  He goes, yeah. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7006.5s)]
*  He goes, I've got to get your number. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7007.5s)]
*  I don't have a pen. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7010.5s)]
*  He goes, no, motherfucker, I don't. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7011.5s)]
*  Do you? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7012.5s)]
*  That sounds like Paul Mooney. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7013.5s)]
*  He didn't give a fuck, dude. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7016.5s)]
*  No, motherfucker, I don't. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7018.5s)]
*  When that guy liked you, it was a badge of honor. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7020.5s)]
*  He was laughing in the back of the room one time when I was on stage. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7024.5s)]
*  It was the nicest thing ever. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7027.5s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, thank you. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7030.02s)]
*  It was Patrice. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7032.02s)]
*  Patrice had that in New York. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7033.02s)]
*  He was going to hate you. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7034.02s)]
*  Everybody's worried that Paul Mooney was going to hate him. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7035.02s)]
*  But you can imagine, this guy was around in the 70s. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7037.02s)]
*  Here he is 35 years later watching us, young fucking snot-nosed idiots. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7040.02s)]
*  Did he have his money though? [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7045.02s)]
*  Was he wealthy? [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7047.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7048.02s)]
*  He's still wealthy. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7049.02s)]
*  He sold out the improv all the time back then. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7050.02s)]
*  He was still a great comic. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7052.02s)]
*  When he would go up, we would all watch him. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7054.02s)]
*  Three hours, too. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7056.02s)]
*  He would go on forever sometime. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7057.02s)]
*  He would go on for long sets if he wanted to. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7059.540000000001s)]
*  He would always go on late. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7061.540000000001s)]
*  It was nice. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7062.540000000001s)]
*  He was a great comic. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7065.540000000001s)]
*  I wonder what the writing process was with him and Prior. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7066.540000000001s)]
*  I wonder what that was like. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7071.540000000001s)]
*  I wonder how they did it back then. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7072.540000000001s)]
*  I bet they just sat there and wrote. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7077.540000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7079.540000000001s)]
*  Maybe they did a lot of drugs. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7080.540000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7081.540000000001s)]
*  Did you have to let your ears breathe? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7082.540000000001s)]
*  I got to go to the bathroom again. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7083.540000000001s)]
*  Go to the bathroom. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7084.540000000001s)]
*  Go to the bathroom. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7085.540000000001s)]
*  It's been neat a lot lately. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7087.06s)]
*  Yesterday, I totally overmodulated. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7089.06s)]
*  I over-hydrated. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7091.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, they gave us, when we were leaving the club yesterday, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7094.06s)]
*  they gave us liquid IV. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7096.06s)]
*  It's like eight bottles of water and one bottle of water. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7098.06s)]
*  I think it's like two. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7102.06s)]
*  Sure. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7103.06s)]
*  It's like two. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7104.06s)]
*  It hydrates you. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7105.06s)]
*  Peter Atiyah was explaining it to me. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7106.06s)]
*  There's an actual formula that it works with 16 ounces of water. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7108.06s)]
*  It doubles the hydration. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7113.06s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7115.06s)]
*  I'm too fucking stupid. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7116.580000000001s)]
*  I just drank it. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7117.580000000001s)]
*  It's filled with electrolytes and it tastes good. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7118.580000000001s)]
*  It's good for you. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7121.580000000001s)]
*  It's really good after workouts. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7122.580000000001s)]
*  After sauna. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7124.580000000001s)]

*  but Mike Tyson version of the gravity bong thing. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7131.580000000001s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7134.580000000001s)]

*  Really? [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7138.580000000001s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7139.580000000001s)]
*  I'm sure it is. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7140.580000000001s)]

*  Do you dab? [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7146.1s)]
*  I stopped. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7148.1s)]
*  More than anything else, the process is so like, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7149.1s)]
*  I never got into the ritual of it. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7154.1s)]
*  I feel like it's a lot to go through to have coughing that's violent. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7156.1s)]
*  Oh, and then there was, did you see, I went down. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7160.1s)]
*  I almost passed out on Legion of Skanks doing dabs. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7165.1s)]
*  No, I didn't see. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7167.1s)]
*  It's on YouTube. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7168.1s)]

*  How did you do? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7170.1s)]
*  Well, here's what it was. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7172.1s)]
*  Almost every time I would do the dab, part of like, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7174.620000000001s)]
*  pause it for a second, anytime I've done a dab, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7177.620000000001s)]
*  if it's a good dab, I would see it as like, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7181.620000000001s)]
*  I'd get that feeling where I'd cough and I'd almost be like, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7184.620000000001s)]
*  the room's gotta kind of like come together for a second. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7187.620000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7190.620000000001s)]
*  You get almost dizzy. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7191.620000000001s)]
*  But I thought that was kind of like the fun of the high of it. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7192.620000000001s)]
*  And on this one, I do that, that's happening. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7195.620000000001s)]
*  I'm on a podcast, so I'm trying not to cough violently. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7198.620000000001s)]
*  I'm keeping my coughs in. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7201.620000000001s)]
*  And while I'm doing that, my next inhale is Lewis just turns [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7204.14s)]
*  and hands me another dab, so I just do it all over again. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7209.14s)]
*  I didn't breathe. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7212.14s)]
*  And you see my head start going, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7213.14s)]
*  and my hand starts like shit. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7215.14s)]
*  It looks scary. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7216.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7217.14s)]
*  A lot of people that were going, [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7218.14s)]
*  you know, everyone diagnoses you after this happens, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7220.14s)]
*  of course, but I just almost passed out. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7222.14s)]
*  No. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7225.14s)]
*  Fuck the second one. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7226.14s)]
*  You remember this already? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7227.14s)]
*  No, look at Mullin. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7228.14s)]
*  Mullin can already tell something's up. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7229.14s)]
*  What was it like? [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7231.14s)]
*  What were you experiencing right here? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7232.660000000001s)]
*  I was aware still, weirdly. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7234.660000000001s)]
*  But what was it like? [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7237.660000000001s)]
*  What were you experiencing? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7238.660000000001s)]
*  Look at Dave realize. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7239.660000000001s)]
*  And he's like, no, wait, I was joking. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7240.660000000001s)]
*  And I'm fine immediately again. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7243.660000000001s)]
*  Did someone happen? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7245.660000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, I thought you were acting. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7248.660000000001s)]
*  I really thought you were doing a bit. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7253.660000000001s)]
*  I'm back. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7256.660000000001s)]
*  Wow, dude. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7257.660000000001s)]
*  I just realized. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7258.660000000001s)]
*  It was funny. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7259.660000000001s)]
*  Brazilians. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7260.660000000001s)]
*  When I was experiencing, I knew my head was going down, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7262.18s)]
*  but I just thought I was kind of going down and coughing. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7265.18s)]
*  And then I heard Lewis go, Jay? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7268.18s)]
*  And I was like, yes? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7271.18s)]
*  Why is the crowd behind you guys? [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7273.18s)]
*  They're going to be on camera. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7275.18s)]
*  What? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7277.18s)]
*  Instead of us facing them? [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7278.18s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7279.18s)]
*  Oh, but they project the show and all the stuff to the audience. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7280.18s)]
*  Oh. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7284.18s)]
*  So in front of us, they're seeing a screen of us [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7285.18s)]
*  and all of the stuff we do. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7289.18s)]
*  And meanwhile, you're right in front of them. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7291.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7293.700000000001s)]
*  That seems ridiculous. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7294.700000000001s)]
*  It's like watching a Twitch stream. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7295.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, don't do that. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7296.700000000001s)]
*  I never really thought of it that way. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7297.700000000001s)]
*  That sucks for the people that are there. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7298.700000000001s)]
*  Didn't we used to face the audience? [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7299.700000000001s)]
*  Or do they sit all around us? [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7300.700000000001s)]
*  Bro, you can figure that out. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7301.700000000001s)]
*  You guys can figure that out. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7302.700000000001s)]
*  Put cameras in a better spot. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7303.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, hearing. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7304.700000000001s)]
*  Facing the audience. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7305.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you can have cameras facing the audience if you want to. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7306.700000000001s)]
*  Well, Lewis, you've heard it here. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7308.700000000001s)]
*  Rogan says you're failing. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7310.700000000001s)]
*  Bobby's cursing this guy right now. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7311.700000000001s)]
*  The people talking should be facing the audience. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7312.700000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7315.700000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7316.700000000001s)]
*  It's done badly right now. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7317.700000000001s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7318.700000000001s)]
*  They're behind you. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7320.22s)]
*  Why are they there? [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7321.22s)]
*  What, are you a priest? [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7322.22s)]
*  Why are they there? [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7323.22s)]
*  They're behind you. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7324.22s)]
*  Let me give you Lewis's theory on that. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7325.22s)]
*  I know there actually is one. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7326.58s)]
*  And I don't heavily disagree with it. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7327.78s)]
*  The show is also for the majority of people taking it in or watching from home. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7330.74s)]
*  So the idea is saying to play to each other more than play. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7338.599999999999s)]
*  When you're staring at the crowd, you tend to go. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7343.98s)]
*  When we did face the audience, we would do a lot more trying the hand and not paying [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7346.900000000001s)]
*  attention to each other in a conversation. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7350.58s)]
*  On one hand, you know what kind of courage it takes to turn your back to your fucking [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7352.1s)]
*  crowd? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7356.26s)]
*  Yeah, you're not wrong. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7357.26s)]
*  Hundreds of people and you're talking mad shit and there's people behind you. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7358.26s)]
*  It is an added element of danger. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7362.14s)]
*  It's also in a club where sometimes through the cracks comes somebody who just came to [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7364.38s)]
*  the club and there happens to be a, because we're sold out pretty much for weeks in advance. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7369.42s)]
*  We've had like two weeks ago, thank God they tend to be pretty cool usually where they [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7376.58s)]
*  quietly leave but we'll end up calling it out anyway. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7378.98s)]
*  This is not for me. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7381.66s)]
*  Yeah, but there was a lady from Canada and her 17-year-old son. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7382.66s)]
*  Are we trying to get them high? [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7386.58s)]
*  Yeah, you were on that episode. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7388.9s)]
*  But she ended up being super cool but they had no idea what they were walking into. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7390.5s)]
*  We lucked out that she was a cool mom. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7394.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7396.139999999999s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7397.139999999999s)]
*  We were like, says hi, we've decided that you will smoke weed and he's like, can I? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7398.139999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine not knowing what you're doing? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7403.46s)]
*  You walk into a Legion of Skanks show. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7406.22s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7408.5s)]
*  It's actually, we've yelled at the club for that before like, hey, don't do that to people [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7409.5s)]
*  because then when they're upset with us, I still kind of feel for them like, well, if [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7412.5s)]
*  you didn't want to see something like this, you should have to watch this. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7416.7s)]
*  It's not their fault. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7419.66s)]
*  You should have to watch this. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7420.66s)]
*  It's not their fault. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7421.66s)]
*  They should have been warned going in there. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7422.66s)]
*  They should have been warned. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7423.66s)]
*  I'm happy you're selling it. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7424.66s)]
*  It's not that when it happens like they went over and it ended up being a good thing. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7425.66s)]
*  It is cool when they catch up though and then they're like, okay, I'll go with this. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7429.22s)]
*  But there is times when people leave and you're like, you can see their faces. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7431.94s)]
*  You're like, why would you have put them like, it's not a stand up show. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7434.259999999999s)]
*  It's not their thing. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7436.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a stand up show. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7437.9s)]
*  They came to watch a stand up show and you go, well, there's this other thing and without [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7439.0599999999995s)]
*  giving them enough like, it could go pretty haywire in there. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7443.74s)]
*  You're going to hear nutty shit. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7447.259999999999s)]
*  In one episode, he had to lube up a gun and Lewis had to shove it up Jay's ass. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7449.58s)]
*  Right there in front of everybody. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7453.98s)]
*  Imagine just a random coming in for a comedy show and you're like, what the fuck's going [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7454.98s)]
*  on? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7459.099999999999s)]
*  My daughter, when she was turned 19, she was almost like, can I come? [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7460.34s)]
*  And there's the... [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7466.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7467.18s)]
*  Well, she's my daughter. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7468.18s)]
*  And so for the most part, she gets what this comedy, do you know what I mean? [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7470.18s)]
*  And I was like, it's not so much the material that we're talking about that's going to get [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7473.5s)]
*  me. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7476.9800000000005s)]
*  Now, what happened with Lewis and Dave, which I fully understand too, they were coming to [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7477.9800000000005s)]
*  me a couple of times and they were like, hey, you got to stop letting her come to the show. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7482.5s)]
*  I'm like, she's an adult, dude. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7487.26s)]
*  She wants to come. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7488.58s)]
*  And my mom was like, you guys kind of have to get used to the idea that she's an adult. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7490.0599999999995s)]
*  And then what they said made me... [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7493.82s)]
*  They were like, yeah, but dude, we're seeing that four-year-old little girl over there [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7495.54s)]
*  that we've known since she was a kid. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7500.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7502.82s)]
*  And he's like, it's going to make me not tell a story that I want to tell because she's [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7503.82s)]
*  there. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7509.18s)]
*  And I go, fair enough. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7510.18s)]
*  And then as a little... [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7511.26s)]
*  She hates it. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7512.26s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7513.26s)]
*  Yeah, she wishes she could come. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7514.26s)]
*  But as a little cherry on top that made it easier to explain to her that we're going [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7515.26s)]
*  to take a break from her coming for a while was that night out of nowhere, Byron, who [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7519.860000000001s)]
*  ended up becoming the intern from the intern contest, sucked his own dick on stage. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7524.46s)]
*  And looking over at my 19-year-old daughter like this, I was like, oh, all right, point [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7529.14s)]
*  taking, guys. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7534.26s)]
*  I'll keep her out of here. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7535.26s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7536.26s)]
*  On stage? [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7537.26s)]
*  On stage. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7538.26s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7539.26s)]
*  By the way, he sucked... [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7540.26s)]
*  Is that legal? [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7541.26s)]
*  This is going to pressure you more. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7542.26s)]
*  That might get you in trouble. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7543.26s)]
*  Now, I'm going to go to the next one. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7544.26s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7545.3s)]
*  Performance art. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7546.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think in something like that. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7547.3s)]
*  It depends on where this is. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7548.3s)]
*  You might have just admitted to a crime. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7549.3s)]
*  It was in his mouth. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7550.3s)]
*  I understand that. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7551.3s)]
*  Legitimately, this might be a crime. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7552.3s)]
*  Are you allowed to blow yourself in front of people? [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7553.3s)]
*  Let's find out. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7554.3s)]
*  I feel like it's the same as masturbation. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7555.3s)]
*  Do you think it'd be worse than that? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7556.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7557.3s)]

*  Do you think it'd be worse than that, crime-wise? [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7573.34s)]
*  I don't know, because it's so weird. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7575.34s)]
*  Well, here's the crazy thing. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7577.34s)]
*  He sucked his own dick while it was soft. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7578.34s)]

*  That's impressive. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7582.34s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7583.34s)]
*  But it was funny. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7584.34s)]
*  He'd dangle it into his head or he'd come down on it. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7585.34s)]
*  How flexible is he? [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7586.34s)]
*  It's funny. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7587.34s)]
*  I was wearing it. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7588.34s)]
*  I said to Lewis, I wonder if you had any opinions or thoughts on G.G. Allen, which was a very [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7589.34s)]
*  similar stage show of just insanity. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7592.02s)]
*  Yeah, shitting on people and stuff. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7594.3s)]
*  I, he's such a, I've been watching these documentaries on him lately, where he's in short films, [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7596.3s)]
*  and people have made. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7602.9800000000005s)]
*  It's funny what I thought was cool when I was younger. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7603.9800000000005s)]
*  As an older performer, I like, and like, you have the picture out there of Jim Morrison, [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7607.14s)]
*  like his mug shot and stuff. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7613.26s)]
*  When I watched The Doors when I was younger, I thought it was the coolest thing because [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7614.780000000001s)]
*  like his defiance and he's like, you know, he might not even show up. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7619.58s)]
*  And the piano player's got to sing all the songs because he's drunk with Jefferson Airplane [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7623.9400000000005s)]
*  somewhere. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7628.700000000001s)]
*  And then when you're a adult performer, you're like, hey Jerkoff, show up and do your show. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7630.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7632.86s)]
*  Like there's no audience waiting. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7633.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7634.86s)]
*  Like there's a coolness to it, but like same thing, G.G. Allen, like I get you want to [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7635.86s)]
*  put on a big show, but I don't know if chucking shit at the people in the audience is like [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7639.26s)]
*  the way to handle it. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7643.0599999999995s)]
*  But meanwhile, some people are like, bro, I got pelted with G.G. shit. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7644.0599999999995s)]
*  Fuck yes! [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7649.0599999999995s)]
*  They probably smear it on their friend. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7650.0599999999995s)]
*  Fuck yeah! [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7653.0599999999995s)]

*  Pink eye forever. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7655.0599999999995s)]
*  Well they always tell you, all the documentaries go, well there was Kevin and Kevin was a sweetheart. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7656.42s)]
*  That was like a character because he's lost in it. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7661.900000000001s)]
*  I mean he was. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7665.5s)]
*  That was a character? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7667.14s)]
*  Just a piece of shit was his character. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7668.14s)]
*  I mean a deplorable piece of shit. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7670.3s)]
*  Did he have any hits? [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7672.54s)]
*  My mother didn't give a shit about me and blah blah blah. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7675.900000000001s)]
*  The man shat himself on stage and smeared it on his face in the name of punk. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7678.5s)]
*  How do you even shit yourself on set standing? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7681.900000000001s)]
*  No buddy, there's videos of this. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7683.900000000001s)]
*  He goes into the audience. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7686.74s)]
*  What's funny is, they love him. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7688.9s)]
*  Look at that picture, look at his tattoo. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7692.099999999999s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7693.66s)]
*  Life sucks, scum, fuck. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7694.66s)]
*  Life sucks, scum, fuck. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7696.259999999999s)]
*  Smearing shit on your face. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7698.78s)]
*  And then the other side says fuck something. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7699.78s)]
*  Fuck something. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7702.5s)]

*  No, that's what I'm saying. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7707.5s)]
*  But what's funny is they talk to his mom and stuff because his story is always like, my [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7710.5s)]
*  mom, the parents didn't give a shit about me and my dad was this and fuck you, that's [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7714.98s)]
*  why I'm angry. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7719.7s)]
*  And his mom's like, just shows pictures of him and his brother, they were both in the [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7720.7s)]
*  band as kids, just on horses. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7724.379999999999s)]
*  They were like, find a bunch of Massachusetts kids. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7728.86s)]
*  And what happened? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7731.78s)]
*  He started getting attention, drugs probably is the ultimate answer. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7733.58s)]
*  He probably got the drugs and was just like, started getting, but I mean like, believing [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7736.58s)]
*  it. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7739.98s)]

*  No, I'm going to get some coffee. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7741.98s)]
*  Or like unrelenting, like terrible shit. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7743.0199999999995s)]
*  All the stuff he's in trouble for, like beating up a woman publicly. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=7746.78s)]

*  You naughty girl. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8075.9400000000005s)]
*  Shit for me. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8076.9400000000005s)]
*  It's gotta be control over sexual. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8077.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8079.54s)]
*  Maybe it's a naughty thing. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8080.82s)]
*  It's so naughty. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8082.14s)]
*  Some boys are like... [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8083.14s)]
*  Shit is so wrong. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8084.14s)]
*  It's funny. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8085.14s)]
*  I can watch that and laugh at it and I don't get that disturbed by it. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8086.14s)]
*  No chance would I watch that in person. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8090.3s)]
*  In person I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8092.0199999999995s)]
*  It's too much. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8093.82s)]
*  Too many senses involved. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8094.82s)]
*  It's also a thing that's built into us to avoid plagues and disease. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8095.82s)]
*  You're supposed to get away from it. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8100.3s)]
*  You shouldn't touch it. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8102.3s)]
*  Get away from that. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8103.3s)]

*  Stuff that comes out of your body will kill people. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8107.3s)]
*  That's a toxic. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8108.3s)]

*  people are dead. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8113.02s)]

*  Is that enough? [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8115.02s)]
*  $5,000 for stinky poop that comes out of me. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8116.02s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8118.74s)]

*  She's gonna keep doing shit. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8122.3s)]
*  I was just like, I don't even think that that could go in the mail. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8123.3s)]
*  I was in question whether or not it was really a joke, reminding her that she went to sell [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8130.46s)]
*  her poop slime on her Sophia's website. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8134.54s)]
*  What is that? [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8137.06s)]
*  There is other... [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8138.820000000001s)]
*  Looks like she was selling it. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8139.820000000001s)]
*  She was selling her poop. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8142.820000000001s)]
*  What a great recycling situation. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8144.26s)]
*  I think that's really dangerous. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8146.26s)]
*  I don't know if that's... [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8147.26s)]
*  This seems like it's almost a joke. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8148.26s)]
*  That's fake. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8150.42s)]

*  She was a team... [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8154.42s)]
*  She was a David Tells underground. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8155.42s)]

*  Oh, really? [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8159.1s)]
*  I remember the underground. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8160.1s)]
*  I think she tried to do comedy for a second, as often will happen. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8161.3s)]
*  Didn't Stormy Daniels try to do comedy? [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8165.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8166.900000000001s)]
*  It's everyone's fallback plan. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8168.74s)]
*  It's the lowest level of anything else. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8170.139999999999s)]
*  Isn't that nice? [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8171.9s)]
*  More respect. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8172.9s)]
*  It's the lowest level of respect that they're like, I can fall back. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8173.9s)]
*  Isn't that better for us, though? [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8175.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8177.9s)]
*  A porn star can just do it. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8178.9s)]

*  No plastic surgery. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8187.62s)]
*  We will have to be honest. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8188.62s)]
*  Don't show it. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8191.9s)]
*  Don't show it, Jamie. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8192.9s)]
*  I'm out. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8193.9s)]
*  Because I can save for myself, though. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8194.9s)]
*  Well, I mean, if you had a video of you pooping, you would imagine, like, man, this has got [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8197.9s)]
*  to be worth a lot of money. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8202.9s)]
*  I can't just poop for $5,000. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8203.9s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8206.9s)]
*  What a moneymaker. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8207.9s)]
*  We're going through a recession. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8208.9s)]
*  A high level, like, well-known porn star who I know. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8210.9s)]
*  No, when we were interviewing her during... [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8215.9s)]
*  Maybe these were quarantine numbers, but during the quarantine, we interviewed her over Zoom, [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8217.9s)]
*  and she was saying that she's doing a lot of OnlyFans, like, private one-on-one stuff [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8222.9s)]
*  now because we're not filming movies or anything right now. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8226.9s)]
*  And I was like, really? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8228.9s)]
*  I go, has anyone asked you to shit on camera? [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8229.9s)]
*  She goes, no, not really. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8234.9s)]
*  She goes, but I mean, that would be like... [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8236.9s)]
*  She's like, that would be a lot. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8238.9s)]
*  I was like, really? [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8240.9s)]
*  I go, how much? [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8241.9s)]
*  She goes, I mean, to like shit? [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8243.9s)]
*  That would be like $500 at least. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8245.9s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8248.9s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8249.9s)]
*  I was almost like, go ahead, do it, I'll Venmo you right now. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8250.9s)]
*  No way that's possible. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8253.9s)]
*  $500? [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8255.9s)]
*  You got to do it anyway. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8256.9s)]
*  It's just where you're doing it. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8257.9s)]
*  It's a buyer's market. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8259.9s)]
*  It's a buyer's market. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8260.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8261.9s)]
*  Like, you're going to shit. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8262.9s)]
*  You're going to flush it for $0? [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8263.9s)]
*  I have a question. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8265.9s)]
*  If you went onto OnlyFans, can you just find people to follow, or do you just only find... [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8266.9s)]
*  Do people find people from their Instagram? [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8273.9s)]
*  Oh, do they suggest people to you? [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8275.9s)]
*  You mean? [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8277.9s)]
*  Yeah, how does someone... [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8278.9s)]
*  Because you can't search people, right? [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8280.9s)]
*  I think you can. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8281.9s)]
*  You can search people? [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8282.9s)]
*  Yeah, but I think finding people on OnlyFans would not be the allure to me. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8283.9s)]
*  The allure would be to find them in the wild. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8288.9s)]
*  And then find out they're OnlyFans. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8291.9s)]
*  And then you find out, oh, you can see this person naked. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8293.9s)]
*  For sure, but you got to think, a lot of these fitness girls that have huge OnlyFans followings, right? [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8295.9s)]
*  Most of those guys, they find out about them somehow. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8301.9s)]
*  Is there a message board out there to tell each other? [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8305.9s)]
*  Are they finding out about them on Instagram? [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8307.9s)]
*  Is it a Facebook thing? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8309.9s)]
*  It's social media. It's all social media, I think. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8311.9s)]
*  Join me on Instagram. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8314.9s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8315.9s)]
*  If a girl's got a great body, all she has to do is work out. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8316.9s)]
*  Just work out on camera and do different stuff every day, and you'll get millions of followers. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8319.9s)]
*  Put on makeup. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8324.9s)]
*  Millions and millions of followers. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8325.9s)]
*  The funniest thing... [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8327.9s)]
*  Look hot, do squats. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8328.9s)]
*  A very fun thing we do is to look at hot girl Instagrams. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8329.9s)]
*  Such a fun industry. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8333.9s)]
*  Just look at the comments under any picture. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8334.9s)]
*  It's like the guys who just... [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8336.9s)]
*  You're awesome. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8338.9s)]
*  But not just you're awesome, it's like they call her baby and stuff. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8339.9s)]
*  Oh, baby, glad to see you're wearing that red bathing suit again. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8342.9s)]
*  No idea that's creepy. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8346.9s)]
*  So sad. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8348.9s)]
*  Those girls live in a life of having to watch over their shoulder for like... [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8349.9s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is the amount of stalkers that must be after them. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8352.9s)]

*  Is that what it says? [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8676.9s)]
*  Baculum. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8677.9s)]
*  Yeah, Baculum is what the penis bones. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8678.9s)]
*  That's the technical name. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8680.9s)]
*  That's gotta be weird. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8683.9s)]
*  You're in your second coat of shellac on your walrus dick. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8684.9s)]
*  Walrus dick club. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8688.9s)]

*  They have a bone in their body. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8690.9s)]
*  But if you think about it, like if you've got a mate quick, [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8693.9s)]
*  predators are after you, you can't just, you've got a walrus? [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8696.9s)]
*  If you're a walrus, like your odds of escaping sharks suck already. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8699.9s)]
*  That's a whale's dick? [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8703.9s)]

*  It's got a violin end. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8712.9s)]
*  I would imagine that. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8713.9s)]
*  Where is that on their body where they can mount somebody? [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8714.9s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8717.9s)]
*  I think they probably have to go under. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8718.9s)]
*  And like bang it from underneath. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8720.9s)]
*  It's gotta be from behind. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8722.9s)]
*  Yeah, they have to go like underneath. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8723.9s)]
*  They have to go like, I would imagine they have to go like this. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8725.9s)]
*  Like here's the girl, and the male goes like this. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8727.9s)]
*  And gets under there. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8730.9s)]
*  And goes like that. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8732.9s)]
*  God, this is a video of whale's fucking. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8734.9s)]
*  Gets under her and they match it. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8736.9s)]
*  And then just like smash it up. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8737.9s)]
*  And slides in there for a little bit. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8738.9s)]
*  Is it one of those? [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8740.9s)]
*  We all would have seen a picture of an upside down whale fucking. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8741.9s)]
*  I've never seen that. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8744.9s)]
*  I've seen whales, they can go in the water and do all kinds of crazy shit. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8745.9s)]
*  Is it coming from behind like a refueling jet? [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8748.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8751.9s)]
*  I would say. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8752.9s)]
*  Underneath and upside down. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8753.9s)]
*  Underneath. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8754.9s)]
*  Do you, yeah, there must be video. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8756.9s)]
*  Maybe they know to both go down in the water and they do it together. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8758.9s)]
*  Is it spraying semen in the water and it just swirms through it? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8761.9s)]
*  No, no, no, that's how fish do it. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8763.9s)]
*  These are mammals. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8764.9s)]
*  So mammals have to breed. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8765.9s)]
*  And they give birth to the young. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8767.9s)]
*  Whereas fish just jizz eggs. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8769.9s)]
*  Don't worry Ari, these whales are all about the cream pie. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8771.9s)]
*  They're all about it. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8774.9s)]
*  They're naturally cream pie animals. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8776.9s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8778.9s)]
*  Yeah, oh that's what they do. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8779.9s)]
*  Upside down, you're right. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8780.9s)]
*  Okay, wow, look at that. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8781.9s)]
*  That's it. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8783.9s)]
*  She flips over and he's got to keep her in spot. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8784.9s)]
*  Oh, it's a scramble because they're both real horny and they can't stay in position because they don't have arms. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8787.9s)]
*  Because they don't have arms. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8793.9s)]
*  Wow, there he goes. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8794.9s)]
*  Oh, it's in. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8795.9s)]
*  It's in. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8796.9s)]
*  Cha-pow. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8797.9s)]
*  Oh, he's hitting from the side. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8798.9s)]
*  I pictured missionary. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8800.9s)]
*  Look at his giant whale dick. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8802.9s)]
*  Now they're married. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8803.9s)]
*  There you go. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8804.9s)]
*  Now they have babies. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8805.9s)]
*  And now they're the happy couple. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8806.9s)]
*  It's wild how smart those fucking things are. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8808.9s)]
*  Those things are smart as shit. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8811.9s)]
*  Ever see them save a walrus they were fucking with when they trained their kids? [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8813.9s)]
*  Yeah, they'll save it if they don't really want to eat it. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8817.9s)]
*  If it's not fully dead, put it back. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8819.9s)]
*  Yeah, if they don't want to eat it. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8820.9s)]
*  They also know how to use ice shelves. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8822.9s)]
*  So one of them will get up to an ice shelf and they'll tip it so that the thing slides to them. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8825.9s)]
*  So they get their massive body and then they're just sliding towards death. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8833.9s)]
*  They're just super intelligent. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8837.9s)]
*  I went whale watching once in South Africa and then you pay all this money and no whales. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8841.9s)]
*  They don't give you your money back. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8850.9s)]
*  Sorry, man, no whale. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8852.9s)]
*  If you want to see whales, Hawaii is a great place to see them. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8856.9s)]
*  You'll always see them there. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8859.9s)]
*  Whenever the time is that they're there for breeding or whatever it is, why they're there, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8861.9s)]
*  there's parts of the year. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8866.9s)]
*  I think it's around November, if I remember correct. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8867.9s)]
*  I've been there a few times where I've seen them. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8869.9s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8870.9s)]
*  You see them in the water splash and you can take a boat towards them. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8871.9s)]
*  When I was in South Africa, we went to Seal Island, which is that only place where the sharks breach. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8872.9s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8873.9s)]
*  To jump and grab the seals. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8874.9s)]
*  That was pretty wild. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8875.9s)]
*  Really? [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8876.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8877.9s)]
*  I haven't seen that. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8878.9s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8879.9s)]
*  Jimmy? [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8880.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's the only place where they ... because the seals are all up on this barge almost [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8881.9s)]
*  and they just jump out and grab them. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8882.9s)]
*  In Alaska? [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8883.9s)]
*  I love when they slide right out of the water. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8884.9s)]
*  The only place in the world where they can do that is the seal island. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8885.9s)]
*  That's a great place to go. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=8886.9s)]

*  You got a chance to do kill Tony there's another open mic on Sunday. It's like the way it's set up [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10106.04s)]
*  It's it's set up to foster new talent, too [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10112.080000000002s)]
*  It's not just set up to take care of existing talent [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10114.960000000001s)]
*  It's set up so that you create a nice comedy environment where people can go and see guys like Shane Gillis [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10118.320000000002s)]
*  He guys like you guys go up see guys like Greg Fitzsimmons, or you know [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10124.68s)]
*  Schultz was here last week. It was fucking amazing like it's they get to see these people coming [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10129.720000000001s)]

*  That's why she's the person the door for that reason to see better comics exactly because it's it's a massive part of the education [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10140.7s)]
*  So to do we wanted to make sure that that was like a big part of what we're doing [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10146.52s)]
*  Do there's a make sure swarm of employees [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10151.160000000002s)]
*  Just like all comics I assume or some level of it. Yeah, just taking care of everything [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10154.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and they get to punch out like if they have a set they can go punch out love that and come back [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10159.92s)]
*  Oh really? Yeah, if you have a set across town just punch out come back. That's awesome. Yeah, don't waste a night do a set [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10164.92s)]
*  Yeah, the whole idea is that it's like it's an environment for growing [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10170.84s)]
*  new people and for for like spreading comedy like a lot of comics particularly in the beginning they need like some [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10176.88s)]
*  Something that they can believe in and count on and you don't necessarily get that if someone's doing these pop-up shows here or there [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10185.88s)]
*  Like how am I included in this? How can I get included in this? [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10192.36s)]
*  The only way is you have to have open mics [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10195.76s)]
*  You have to have open mics see only way and then on top of open mics [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10198.84s)]
*  You have to have like little satellite rooms. There's got to be a way you can kind of branch out [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10202.88s)]
*  This guy's got a room here [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10207.119999999999s)]
*  He's got a room there and you make this you network with the other comics that are doing that and you put together a fucking act [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10208.279999999999s)]
*  But you want to know that there's like what is what's the scene like what what's the community like? [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10214.88s)]
*  How many good comics around here? [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10221.18s)]
*  How can I learn from these people because if you're stuck in a place where you're the funniest guy in town [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10222.779999999999s)]
*  You're in some weird spot in the middle of nowhere. You got to get out of there [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10227.06s)]
*  Yeah, right if you want to grow as a comic you're not gonna go to the top [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10230.9s)]
*  Yeah, you're not gonna grow in a vacuum [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10233.859999999999s)]
*  but do you think that's what I mean because it would used to be obviously they always they push you to the coast New York or [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10235.539999999999s)]
*  LA [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10241.18s)]
*  That's kind of like over now. Do you think it's as like here in Nashville is the same? [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10242.34s)]
*  Difference at this point as far as like what you try to know what's going on in Nashville [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10248.300000000001s)]
*  I mean Nashville's Zanies, which the great clubs been forever. It's one of the best in the country [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10252.74s)]
*  But I don't know what the scene is other than Zanies. I don't know much either. There's a lot of clubs here now [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10257.060000000001s)]
*  It's bigger here. It's a lot bigger. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of clubs here now. It's it's different [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10262.34s)]
*  There's a lot of like world-class comedians that moved here [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10266.7s)]
*  It's it's kind of different and it's just look like just want to make it a great place for everybody [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10269.34s)]
*  Fun for what we love to do that's what we loved the most about the store was the hang the camaraderie [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10274.78s)]
*  We're just always fucking around always laughing always having a fun hang. Yeah, and we also watch each other's sets [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10280.42s)]
*  I like that new thing we talked about a new bit [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10287.02s)]
*  It's fun [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10289.62s)]
*  but I was the best like New York was the best gym is the way I would put it for comedy because of the [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10290.38s)]
*  availability of stage time and [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10295.86s)]
*  Mm-hmm, you just kind of keep going up from like 3 p.m [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10297.5s)]
*  If you wanted to yeah until you know 2 o'clock in the morning [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10299.86s)]
*  And I don't think that's even true at all anymore that you need to be in that scene now at all [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10303.220000000001s)]
*  and that's what I mean like you could really [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10308.58s)]
*  get full-on successful and never leave your [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10310.62s)]
*  Hometown well, I'm the hometown's wrong thing. But I said there's just more avenues [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10314.58s)]

*  Kind of podcasts for us the industry is podcasts the industry is podcasts and stand-up [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10376.66s)]
*  That's the industry for us. Like we think of the industry is like someone's gonna hire us to do something outside of doing stand-up [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10382.1s)]
*  Yeah, right. It's like which is like [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10387.26s)]

*  One-two talent just but that's the nature of the gig [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10440.66s)]
*  The nature of the gig is you got to depend on other people to come up with stuff that you can get credit for [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10443.34s)]
*  It's a nature of the gig and you know, you have enormous power [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10451.82s)]
*  When you're at a network like deciding what does and doesn't get on everyone's gonna like you and it's all so weird [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10456.34s)]
*  Like, you know, they have these weird sweetheart deals of production companies [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10463.18s)]
*  At least they did in the sitcom days and so like a crappy show would be on the right after friends [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10466.6s)]
*  It would be like number two in the ratings and everybody [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10470.58s)]
*  These are garbage shows shows we just a guy oh Jesus Christ, there's a few of them [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10475.18s)]
*  They also ran shows. It was like in between Seinfeld and friends [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10480.34s)]
*  Yeah, between Seinfeld and ER Paul Sims from news radio famously called it a shit sandwich [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10484.18s)]
*  It's like it's what it is it's like they're sandwiching two good shows Seinfeld and friends [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10490.14s)]
*  So more idea the idea now of anything like that Abbott Elementary, I've never seen it [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10495.539999999999s)]

*  It's a huge but where does that happen anymore? [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10503.74s)]
*  Like where a sitcom is like should be anyone's like endgame anymore [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10505.74s)]
*  Yeah, feel like if it's really good people always love them [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10509.339999999998s)]

*  It's just like it seems like I thought that there's no learning from like the mistakes [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10522.939999999999s)]

*  But on mute and you're just like this looks like a sketch [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10555.38s)]
*  Looks like they're playing a sketch of what a sitcom was it used to be the thing you wanted [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=10558.14s)]

*  What didn't he there was a thing in the book where he threatened one of the Beach Boys [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11038.14s)]
*  Because he wanted to be a musician. Yeah, right. You remember that [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11043.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he wanted to be a musician. It didn't work out for him [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11048.019999999999s)]
*  So he was trying to kill one of the fucking Beach Boys [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11050.74s)]
*  I think it was Brian Wilson to replace him or he was so now to punish him [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11053.699999999999s)]
*  No, so it was the Beach Boys guy. It was Brian Wilson's brother. What do you know? [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11057.98s)]
*  Well, so whatever the Wilson it was I believe what did he accuse him of? [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11062.699999999999s)]
*  So I think he just like loved getting his drugs and pussy that he would bring around [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11066.060000000001s)]

*  He brought one of his songs to the Beach Boys and they recorded it [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11081.140000000001s)]
*  I think the Beach Boys recorded a song written co-written at least yeah [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11084.26s)]
*  Never learn never to love was written by Charles Manson [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11087.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if you've ever heard this fact before without any details [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11091.12s)]
*  You might think that Manson had some kind of career in the music industry before he went weird [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11094.080000000002s)]
*  Those murders meant he was connected with a bunch of stars in Los Angeles, right? [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11097.52s)]
*  But this connection was more than professional for a while Beach Boy Dennis Wilson [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11101.36s)]
*  Yeah was actually sharing a house with the Manson family once Manson had already become a cult leader [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11106.400000000001s)]
*  By a house we made [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11111.880000000001s)]
*  Wilson's own house the family moved in took over and Wilson had to flee and abandoned all his belongings to escape the family's clutches [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11113.800000000001s)]
*  Oh shit [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11121.76s)]
*  It all started in April 1968 when Wilson picked up a couple of hitchhiking women [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11123.04s)]
*  Have you ever seen once upon a time in Hollywood? [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11127.08s)]
*  Picture that scene where Brad Pitt's character picks up a Manson follower played by Margaret Quailey the women of the family used this tactic [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11129.48s)]
*  Repeatedly to lure in new followers the two hitchhikers offered to come to Wilson's place [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11137.52s)]
*  Wilson didn't realize they'd take up residence following the one-night stand or that their guru Charles and his other followers would move in as well [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11142.6s)]
*  Holy shit [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11151.0s)]
*  Margaret Quailey also Pete Davidson's notch list [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11152.72s)]
*  Bless him dude [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11156.599999999999s)]
*  fellow Beach Boy Brian Wilson would later describe coming to dinner at Dennis's place and seeing him with [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11157.5s)]
*  Manson and a bunch of Manson girls all naked and LSD orgy followed dinner [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11163.439999999999s)]
*  and when he declined to take part and just went for a shower a naked Charles tried to join him there and [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11168.119999999999s)]
*  Warned him that leaving the group was not an option. Wow [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11175.56s)]
*  You're fucking us. Oh my god leaving the group was not an option. No showers. You're fucking us. Oh my god [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11179.64s)]
*  Yeah, and then the first thing [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11186.64s)]
*  Imagine Charles Manson in your house with a boner [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11190.52s)]
*  Time to fuck get down here. This is not an option. You're come on. It's not an option [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11194.0s)]
*  Yeah, but what it was I think like [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11200.48s)]
*  Well [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11203.240000000002s)]
*  Brian got the hell out of the house that night, but Dennis stayed behind of course and for a while [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11206.160000000002s)]
*  He seemed trapped the family occupied his home for months racking up close to a million dollars in [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11209.960000000001s)]
*  Expenses in today's money including a large amount just on STD treatments [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11215.560000000001s)]
*  Spoke highly advanced and and said he was happy the family were relieving him of the burden of wealth was sounds truly like something [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11222.68s)]
*  Member would say they're relieving over the burden you can just give it away [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11230.28s)]
*  Wow, and then the guy was the reason ended up at Sharon Tate's was I guess it was the producer that [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11233.56s)]
*  So I think that Dennis guy was eventually like, okay, man [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11239.84s)]
*  I'll try to get you like a record deal and took it to whoever this producer was and the producer was like [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11242.24s)]
*  Not inch. I think he was like not interested and then moved the next day [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11247.48s)]
*  Oh my god, and so they went to the wrong. Yeah, he wasn't there to kill like Sharon Tate and they just killed everybody in the house [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11251.16s)]
*  That's so spooky [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11257.16s)]
*  He was like kill whoever's oh no was that that was them. Those are everybody in the house Sharon Tate [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11259.0s)]

*  But that's the thing man with these [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11310.88s)]
*  These LSD cults like what they were doing was orchestrated [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11313.4s)]
*  Like they were trying to figure out what was possible with LSD and the best way to figure that out [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11317.759999999998s)]
*  Was to get someone to do it on a bunch of hippies and that way you could discredit the movement at the same time [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11322.48s)]
*  You could also find out what strategies you can employ to get people to follow you and can you get people to murder people? [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11328.72s)]
*  If you if you do this correct be a nice tactic you also get it up to fuck those dumpy broads, you know [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11334.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah squeaky frump [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11340.359999999999s)]

*  Brothels. Yeah, right. They did it at brothels. They did this operation midnight climax [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11353.4s)]
*  So these guys would go into these whorehouses [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11358.119999999999s)]
*  Try to have sex with the lady the lady would give them a drink and the drink would have acid in it and they'd be [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11360.480000000001s)]
*  Tripping balls through a two-way mirror and they would study these guys [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11365.240000000002s)]
*  That's what this is squeaky from is this her talking [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11369.160000000002s)]

*  I'm gonna I'm gonna go see what's necessary [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11392.64s)]
*  So I had all these thoughts [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11397.2s)]
*  about what I wanted to accomplish and [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11400.2s)]
*  I just put the gun out and stuck it in there and there was no bullet in the chamber [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11403.68s)]

*  And [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11427.48s)]
*  When I they had me on the ground and I was telling him it's okay. It's okay. It didn't go up. It's okay [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11428.72s)]
*  the [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11437.599999999999s)]
*  Guy walked over and he picked up my hand and I was so relaxed [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11439.0s)]
*  then he [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11445.119999999999s)]
*  Was talking to me and the Secret Service agent said who are you? [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11446.519999999999s)]
*  He was a guy with a beard. I [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11452.16s)]
*  Always wanted to talk to him afterward [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11454.56s)]
*  Whoa, you know, they're so like they're like, yeah [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11458.44s)]
*  Is that lady out of jail or did they film this in jail like that? [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11462.4s)]
*  Which is really creepy if she's out of jail. She must be out of jail [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11466.16s)]
*  She must be out of jail. There's no way that if they wanted to do it in jail [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11471.119999999999s)]
*  They would make it look like you're in jail. That's why I look not in jail [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11474.72s)]
*  They really did go against [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11478.52s)]
*  Jail clothes so much more fun. Yeah, you want jail clothes [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11480.6s)]
*  They were against like all of the ideas of hippies though, but wasn't that also sort of the thing? [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11483.76s)]
*  Was they were supposed to be setting people up right like they were gonna go do violent crimes to blame [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11490.4s)]
*  There's a lot of people to there's a lot of war. Yeah, Charles thought he was gonna start a race war [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11495.36s)]
*  But there's a lot of what they were doing was [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11500.32s)]
*  orchestrated by him giving these people [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11505.04s)]
*  Acid and telling them what to do and then him not doing acid and he was like guiding them. It's really creepy [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11507.04s)]
*  It's almost wish that before he died. He would have told the story of like how all that happened [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11512.36s)]
*  So he was like you're not gonna make me make them do this thing [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11518.160000000002s)]
*  I'll just not take the acid then I'll make him do whatever I want [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11521.34s)]
*  Yeah, he would he would look first of all like those killings like he wasn't involved in those but he might have killed some people [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11524.960000000001s)]
*  There's some evidence and he probably killed someone somewhere along the line and then there was you know [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11531.800000000001s)]
*  These people that were just lost kids lost kids and getting dosed up with acid by like the lifetime criminal [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11536.92s)]
*  A guy was a con man his whole life [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11544.44s)]
*  Working in conjunction with the CIA if that's true. That is a fucking wild thing that happened [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11546.68s)]
*  Yeah, and that they did it to try to stop the anti-war movement and stop the hippie movement [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11553.12s)]
*  But we know they did certain things like that [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11557.960000000001s)]
*  Like I had Rick Doblin from maps on the other day and he was explaining how the sweeping schedule one act of 1970 a lot [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11559.64s)]
*  Of it was designed to stop [[03:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11566.72s)]
*  protests and to stop the Black Panthers and to stop all these other people that were doing all these different things like the anti-war people [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11568.279999999999s)]
*  Because then they could arrest them they could arrest them for pot they could arrest them for mushrooms [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11574.439999999999s)]
*  They could arrest and this is schedule one shit now [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11579.199999999999s)]
*  You're all away all the people that thought it was okay to take acid [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11581.88s)]
*  Nope now you're going to jail and they could just round up everybody with these new [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11584.92s)]
*  Yeah, say hey, they were on acid and people like oh, okay [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11590.199999999999s)]
*  People scatter to like how committed are you to the cause if everybody's getting locked up by the government you get the fuck out [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11592.92s)]
*  Of town you abandon ship and start a real job a lot of people probably bailed on it [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11597.960000000001s)]
*  That's probably wanted to do many uncredited manson family members, and they do they pop up in like documentaries [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11602.08s)]
*  They go yeah, you can see me the back of one picture. My name is cliff [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11608.04s)]

*  Right that's where you get your information from and you know there's a little briefing on the five o'clock news [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11631.0s)]
*  nobody knows what the fuck is going on you're hearing word of mouth right and [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11635.76s)]
*  You find out that these people getting murdered in the Hollywood Hills by hippies [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11640.04s)]
*  You're like what we gotta get rid of these hippies what exactly it's so scary. They're doing ass and they're murder people [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11643.76s)]
*  It's a perfect plan if you really can get a guy like Manson and convince him that he's got to do this for you [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11649.2s)]
*  And that's why he's free like we have you you're free like he gets arrested [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11655.2s)]
*  They get him out look you owe me you piece of shit you understand me like and then get him to do these things [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11659.16s)]

*  It was just like a kill whoever was there [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11686.94s)]
*  I think Manson found out when they went home that it was like hey that producer guy you're pissed off wasn't there [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11688.82s)]

*  That's you're hooking me up so much like here's a producer and when the producer was like not interested [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB33KM_RfU&t=11712.84s)]
