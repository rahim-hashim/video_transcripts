# Joe Rogan Experience #1495 - Kyle Dunnigan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_yasKdeo8c)
*  Do
*  Smoking marijuana this is dangerous is they're gonna go crazy you think yes, don't you watch those movies?
*  I forgot about that yeah pot drugs will make you crazy
*  They'll make you nuts are you talking about those old videos the old-timey black and white where they live in madness
*  Yeah, yeah, do you know where those are those were funded by oh?
*  William Randolph Hearst was that right yeah that piece of shit. He was a piece of show right bud
*  Yeah, and his daughter brought a gun into a bank Wow
*  Why maybe she wanted to protect her money? She's rich as fuck. So she's robbing the place
*  Do I have the wrong person Patty Hearst Patty Hearst? That's right? Yeah must be related right? What is she the granddaughter?
*  I think she's the granddaughter because she's too young to be the daughter. I like that we have no information
*  Let's go that but let's broadcast it millions
*  Write this down kids
*  Yeah, Patty Hearst. Yeah, that's right. Well
*  William Randolph Hearst is also the reason why there's wild pigs in California
*  How's why is that because that asshole brought them to his ranch he wanted to have a menagerie?
*  I think that's the correct term menagerie of animals. He's a nutty person you could visit Hearst Castle. It's this crazy place
*  Yeah, yeah, I want to go there so northern California has kind of an infestation of wild pigs
*  And it's because directly because of William Randolph Hearst really the pigs that left his compound to start fucking and running through the woods like
*  There it is. That's the that's the place. I feel you could solve that it's bow and arrow
*  No, it's very hard to solve
*  Well wild pigs are the hardest
*  Animal to solve in terms of like invasive species because they fuck like crazy and they breed like three times a year
*  So one pig can have like three litters in a year. So pigs love to fuck
*  They love it. I've always said that dirty pigs
*  There's something in Hawaii where they had some infestation and they brought in this other animal to get it
*  But they brought the wrong animal and then that became the infestation again something. I don't have enough information about yeah
*  I think that's a mistake
*  I think you're incorrect about that because for something that could kill pigs it would have to be a big predator like a cat
*  Oh, no, this wasn't pigs look at different infestation. Why it was okay. It was slowly slightly related to your story
*  Well, I know they did that in Australia Australia fucked themselves up hardcore
*  They brought in animals to kill animals and those animals want to running a muck and killing it
*  That's what always seems to happen. Yeah, they're running cats like house cats. They have an infestation of wild house cats in Australia
*  Well, it's kind of cute though
*  I mean it's better than but it's sick because
*  Bow hunters are like paid to hunt cats like people are paid bounties for house cats
*  So in Australian hunting magazines, you'll see guys holding up a house cat. What do you get per cat?
*  I don't think you get a lot
*  Can't live off of your cat. I think it kills. Yeah, I don't think it's not like beaver pelts or anything like that
*  What's really valuable how high is this gonna make I got a stop. We're already gone. We're already gone
*  Really hit it four times man. I'm already not starting off with a lot of IQ points. I can't
*  You points for spitting facts son. Yeah. Yeah, wild animals fucking wild cats. You're the one who told me about the
*  Mustard weed and once you said that I can't not see mustard weed and that crazy. I think it came from Russia
*  That crazy beautiful yellow weed that covers the hills in California. It's really pretty. I you know, it's awesome
*  I thought it was pretty to you told me it was a weed now
*  I think it was gross isn't that weird you call one plant one thing another plant. It's a fucking plant
*  You know like what we're really racist with plants. We are a plan us, you know, we're plan is so if you see like a beautiful
*  Green grass, but it's got some weird like daisies popping up people get mad at those daisies
*  They're nice fucking daisies running my grass. They'll go pluck them rip them out of their life. Fuck you
*  You're not what I want. Yeah, they're very I have a phone with that. They want uniform
*  Just all the grass right right, isn't that a weird thing that we do a lawn is a weird thing
*  How so which controlling nature on a large scale in our own community our own little yard?
*  We have a little spot and we lock it down. We want that grass nice
*  Want that grass nice and cut and clean? Yeah, it's a thing like people sit back
*  Look what is happening with grass like when you see grab? Why does it make you feel so good?
*  Like I don't play golf, but I feel good when I see a golf course. I see all that green like oh, that's nice
*  I guess it is. It's uniform. You could walk on it. Yeah, there's no danger
*  It's nice for your feet, but it's also you you controlled that shit like the men
*  Took that grass and bend it to their will. Yeah, that feels good. Yeah
*  Fuck you. Yeah, fuck you only grass fuck you trees you ever get we ever go weeding. Yeah, fuck trees
*  I
*  Would chop trees down fuck off tree. Yeah, I don't want you there that the manless job the lumberjack
*  Oh for sure how many chick lumberjacks are there?
*  Three those gotta be the toughest women on the planet lumberjack chicks
*  So like it's like mfemal MMA fighters like Amanda Nunes and then lumberjack chicks after the
*  After the chainsaw though. It's a little bit like it's still it's dangerous as fuck
*  Yeah, you got to do it right things go wrong all the time people get hit with trees
*  We've talked about everything. I don't know anything about me, too. I don't know what I'm talking about
*  Maybe people never get hit by trees. I'm pretty sure they do though. I think it's actually pretty safe
*  It turns out lumberjacks never died. Yeah, they live older than everybody. No, I think they think they die all the time
*  I think well
*  I just there if you see a fucking tree like a big-ass oak tree my god
*  That's a lot of weight. Yeah, that thing could crush you
*  So yeah, if you fuck up and it hits it takes a bounce and it hits somebody or I mean
*  Chop trees down, but you're just dealing with so much weight
*  Yeah, I could imagine like someone fuck like if you don't know what you're doing
*  You're an asshole, and you just bought a plot of land
*  I'm gonna be a farmer and you start chopping down trees by yourself. Yeah, you could kill yourself easy
*  You gotta do the wedge I?
*  Know what I'm talking about. I don't know what I'm talking about either, but they do have a method to it
*  But but I wonder how many women that would be a crazy reality show. They probably have already done it
*  female lumberjacks
*  Yeah, they had that lumber did do that weird thing where they climb a pole real quick they do lumberjack contest contest
*  He's like yeah, I remember those you run on a log. Yeah. Yeah in the water right the logs
*  That comes up a lot you know when you're crossing the stream
*  lumberjill
*  Is that what they call them just looked it up? Oh, okay? I don't need to be disrespectful
*  I just talked a lot of shit a lot of guys wanting the lumberjill
*  Calendar you know I mean right right
*  Oh there. They are some big-ass women
*  Big strong women that'll fuck you up. You like a strong woman. Yeah, yeah, I don't want to can't carry things oh
*  Yeah, she's a girl. They're throwing axes and shit. Oh my God
*  Yeah, that's a tough stock if you wanted to make like a warrior child you find one of them women
*  Yeah, they can get through a winter. Hell. Yeah. Yeah, they can they can walk to the road. Did you find a lumberjill TV show?
*  I think he did
*  See we just took a guess and there's a fucking show about it. Let's show that everything you know
*  They there's like a fun game to play we're like try to name and come up with an app that doesn't exist
*  It's actually right really hard. Oh my God
*  I would imagine there's a bunch of wizards like really smart kids sitting around trying to do that right now. Yeah, I
*  Didn't take the picture with the sword is out the end you can take a picture with a sword
*  Awesome, and don't you have like this like whiskey you give everybody you want some whiskey is this too much?
*  No, sure. No come a little bit a little bit. I haven't seen you in forever man now with the comedy store embargo
*  It's just beautiful to be in the room with you. I know it actually is really nice to it's fun
*  Humans. Oh, it's so nice to be with comics
*  Yeah, like Doug Stanhope said this best and I quote him all the time, but it really is a great quote
*  He said I can quit comedy, but I couldn't quit comics. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah, I when I'm around
*  Normie normies normies normies normies like I I started dating
*  This was my big year to date I'm like cuz I've been focusing on my career stuff whatever and I'm like I'm gonna date in
*  2020 Wow, this is my big year and the COVID yeah, but I got an app
*  So I met a couple of girls I was chatting with bored out of my I mean sweet nice people
*  But just when you don't know someone I'm not doing to be a comic. Yes
*  It's like if you've never met them you're not you know
*  Hooking up and having dinners whatever just to talk to a stranger on the phone about their cat
*  It's I had to end all that some people don't know what it sounds like when they talk
*  Yeah, they just drone on and they don't seem to know yeah, and you're like oh my god. You're killing me
*  You're not even paying attention. Yeah, that I'm not I can't take what you're saying. Yeah, read the room
*  Just blah blah blah some people just have some shit in their head, and they're gonna get it out
*  They're gonna vomit it out onto your ears. It's a business
*  I
*  It doesn't matter how long it takes yeah, and they're gonna repeat themselves
*  And they're gonna like make a big deal out of shit
*  That's not a big deal, and you're gonna want to run through a fucking wall
*  Yeah, but you gotta listen all that so maddening feels like your life is passing you by and you're dying
*  It is maddening, but the good thing is what it really does. I'm a bright side of the what is it?
*  What's that going the bright side of the coin? I believe it's not a real expression
*  I mixed up my expressions. I'm a glass the glasses came down. I'm a glass of
*  coins um I
*  This is the good stuff right
*  I gotta be someone's gonna put a little cap on me
*  No, I feel bad for any listener we want to make a public apology
*  We're both having trouble thinking to
*  2020 the greatest year of all we're gonna make this is what are they calling a mulligan those dudes who played golf?
*  Oh, do you get no one? What's a mulligan mean?
*  You gotta do over
*  Let's just scratch this whole year. That'd be great
*  I like to toast to things people don't agree with like at the last minute
*  They've already committed you should make to 9-eleven and they already clink how rude
*  I know I think there's gonna be a lot of good that comes out of this year. I really do
*  This I like talking about positive stuff. What are you thinking is well?
*  I think people are realizing that society and
*  civilization hangs on by a thread in some cases and
*  You know when a series of events can happen it could derail our life radically
*  I don't think people were really aware that that was possible before I
*  Think there's a lot of things going on
*  There's a lot of competing mindsets and competing ideologies
*  And there's a lot of anger going on in the world right now
*  And then there's this fucking fear that comes with a pandemic everything like pandemics ramp up everything like
*  This is I have to think about it. We're thinking about it. It's just a pandemic, but it's also off
*  There's a mind disease like a fear disease that's sweeping through the land too, right?
*  and I feel like it's like like your
*  Your your resources are being used up in so many different directions that it's like you're a little overrun
*  It's one of the reasons why people are reacting
*  So violently to things lately there's everything is just ramped up and I feel like
*  There's there's like a certain level of other things that you can tolerate in your life
*  When you have so many things compounding and piling on top of each other
*  It's like the reason why they say that people get road rage
*  Is because it's not just you're in a car and someone does something stupid
*  But your set your senses are heightened because you know you're going 60 miles an hour, so you're very aware
*  It's a very different feeling right I didn't even consider that
*  I thought when I first heard about I thought road rage just people being a pussy like you're being mean
*  While you're locked in this little box because you know you can't nobody can say anything to you
*  Yeah, but it's not just that it's fear like cuz you're fucking driving fast
*  And it's like if everybody fucks up if someone's texting you don't in your lane
*  Yeah, you could die so because of that because we have this in our head
*  It causes us to be like extra ramped up
*  And I think that's how we are right now with everything because of kovat
*  Even if you don't have kovat even if you're not worried about kovat what it's done
*  Is this made everybody ramp up so everybody's almost got road rage
*  So everybody is like a little bit more stressed out than they've ever been before a little bit more ramped up and everything gets exaggerated
*  And everything gets blown out, and there's so many more
*  instances of
*  Scary things that you're being seen in the news and so few instances of really nice things
*  Yeah, and it's like fuck what a weird combination of things to try to manage
*  Yeah, I I've never raged before in my life like screamed and raged and then when this thing happened
*  I it was it took me where I had a few times where I raged
*  It's understandable. It's totally understandable. Yeah, but it's totally understandable. I mean we're all
*  expected to manage our
*  Energy and our anxiety and we're expected to do it perfectly
*  We're supposed we're expected to be exactly who we were four or five months ago before all this shit happened
*  I think that's crazy
*  Yeah, I think people are under like mad fucking weird stress that we've never experienced before right the economic stress the stress of the virus
*  I think we just need to fucking make a collective
*  Global effort like a collected effort to just be nice to each other. I think it's possible
*  I think we can realize that yeah, look what can happen. Look how sideways everything can get
*  we just get lost and go in the woods or
*  Let's work together. What's like? What do you want? Do you don't you want nice neighbors? I want nice neighbors
*  So if I want nice neighbors, don't I want a whole nice city don't know a whole nice community
*  Don't I want a whole nice country? Why is that impossible? It feels like people are communicating well
*  Recently, I think some people are trying some people are trying
*  It's just that it's hard to do like there's too much of our time is spent
*  Communicating on like social media stuff. It's too much time. Yeah, it's like it's too one-dimensional and it's too you it's too frequent
*  So it's too many interactions where you're not getting like real
*  Real human feedback. You're not getting real love. You're not getting real friendship
*  You're talking just to the ether like you're typing things into glass and you know on the other end
*  Someone's gonna interpret it. Yeah, but it's a terror
*  It's just the worst way to communicate and that's most of what people are doing today. So the most ineffective
*  unemotional
*  Unconnecting way to communicate is the most common right and that's why we're acting like fucking nuts
*  Do you part of it? Do you think we can back off that? Yes, we can back up back up gotta get a flip phone
*  That's been the problem the whole
*  Flip phones just have to get better text recognition software or voice-to-text
*  Recognition software so you can just talk your messages into a flip phone
*  So all anybody could do is text you and call you just leave me off of everything else
*  Group texts people are just too worked up. They're too worked up about everything
*  Well some things they should be worked up about but the problem is there's no balance
*  Because it's almost all the stuff that they're angry about because that's what they want to text and tweet and Facebook about
*  And very little of the stuff like what's the ratio of like really cool stories?
*  Like that make you feel good to like another horror in the news. What's the ratio?
*  Ninety something to one ninety something to one. There's a new one. There's a cloud of dust
*  It's coming from Africa across the fucking ocean. It's gonna rip us out
*  Really?
*  This year is like the devil scripted this
*  What is it what is it dust I don't know man
*  I didn't know dust could fly that far all the way across the ocean in that crazy
*  Where is it right now like I know this is something I gotta we're at Def Con 5 or some shit. What happens?
*  It's not a storm. I don't know. I just read it
*  I was like, oh my god, and they said Yellowstone's ready to blow that scares me the most the most the most we're pretending
*  We're over here pretending that this this is all permanent happens a few times a year. Oh
*  Does it really fairly common? What does it do?
*  Proportion for the news. I think just the headline sounds crazy. How headline sounds terrible
*  The one I found says it's a silver lining. So it's actually kind of maybe a good thing
*  Oh signifies a dry very dry layer in the atmosphere and hurricanes don't like dry air. So oh
*  Well, that's good. Okay. Oh, see we jumped the gun. Oh
*  That sounds great. That was a great story. How about that? How about hurricanes?
*  How about the fact that every fucking year the sky becomes a monster and eats people?
*  Fucking throws cars through the air and shit every year it happens and it's getting it's getting worse, right?
*  The fire is getting worse. I see they say that and it makes sense that it's getting worse
*  And this is not an excuse for like the carbon emissions. This makes it sound way worse
*  What is oh my god enormous cloud of dust from Africa Sahara appears to be heading for Texas, Louisiana and Florida
*  It's like it's a missile and then they show a dust storm like taking over a city. Oh my god
*  Is that really what it was like? I don't think so. I mean that's not what the other article
*  I just show that video though. What does it say massive dust storm?
*  Turns the sky red and send Denise Capitol. Oh my god, man. Look at that
*  I was in Mission Impossible 4 I think was it yeah, he was on that sky ride
*  He got caught in the dust storms coming. Yeah, dude imagine living there and seeing that coming
*  You like oh my god, I'm gonna be breathing dirt for the next hour like how long does it last
*  How long is the dust storm last do you imagine living there man
*  You gotta go to the grocery store and you're literally walking through a dust storm
*  So you dressed like one of them dudes from the Lord of the Rings, right?
*  Right, you know, you should just fucking scoffs across your face. Like no the guys in Star Wars. What are they called?
*  The ones who lived like in the dirt and then yeah the sand people
*  Sand people. Yeah, I don't think that was their name. There's also the little one. You have it a little ones
*  Yeah, there was a bunch of those were the damn it but those sand people now you walks with a fluffy one
*  But who were the sand people?
*  Yeah, maybe that's it. Yeah
*  I think that's it. They're called Jawas. They're called jaw. Are they? Yeah sounds right
*  Jaw I believe you I think you a whole
*  podcast of things we kind of know
*  We're already doing it. I don't think man. I mean look there's no way
*  That's the weather just stays the same. It doesn't stay the same. It's never stayed
*  It doesn't but we have to listen to climatologists 100% Yeah
*  I don't know why it drives me nuts, but I just but this is my point of view like legitimately
*  We have a bigger concern
*  One of the bigger concerns is we're not prepared if anything goes sideways and that's what we're finding from this COVID thing
*  We're not really prepared if things go sideways
*  Yeah, and we definitely should be protecting against the human impact on the climate change
*  It's real. We really have fucked up the earth
*  however
*  Even if we didn't fuck it up this place is so unstable
*  Even if it wasn't us the asteroids the hurricane just exist and have always existed
*  Earthquakes we just we just don't live long enough to see enough of these to be scared of them
*  Yeah, cuz our lives are so fucking short
*  Yeah
*  And the life of the earth is so long that these all these tectonic plates shit like when we go to a mountain like wow
*  That's really pretty look what happened. It's alive
*  That things moving right now. There's va lava under it if you saw like 10,000 years a second you would just see the whole earth
*  Just
*  Oceans come in and out and it's constantly doing that it's always done that we definitely should stop fucking up
*  The world that we're living in the world that we exist in but even if we didn't this is so dangerous
*  Yeah, this whole place is covered with predators
*  We are just super lucky we killed most of them off and boxed ourselves away and some people forgot
*  Except for those pigs we got to figure out that Astro. We're not looking at enough of the sky
*  I think we're looking at 3%
*  Dude, and you get different answers from different folks when you ask them how long it would take before they could deflect something forget
*  Well, I think Neil deGrasse Tyson. What did he say 10 years? Do you remember?
*  Good like you got to figure out how you're gonna do it and Jesus
*  Bro, yeah, Jesus, it's too big. There's nothing you can do if it's too big. There's nothing you can do
*  But I I don't know we could get a just you have one week to live just could come on the news today
*  We just saw this asteroid
*  Calendar supposed to technically end next week. Oh Jesus that thing always comes up though, and it's never anything
*  You know what shocks me is when you have that the leader of a cult and they have doomsday
*  And they have a date and the time they all go outside and they sing and it doesn't happen and then that guy
*  Convinces them to stay and he goes no, it's a different day. Yes, and they all just
*  It was a guy who was taking out billboards
*  There was a billboard in Woodland Hills on Ventura Boulevard
*  And it had this fucking billboard and he had a bunch of them all over the place
*  But they had this billboard that showed the very day the earth was gonna end like it was like it had a date on it
*  Do you remember it? I thought I want to say it was like somewhere around eight or May
*  Scientist says reading my encounter predicts end of the world this week
*  Okay, whatever
*  The post is trolling you son
*  Like that we listen to people who just like put leeches on people that hear according to the Sun actually
*  You know what man they they did have a weird culture the Mayans had a weird culture
*  It was it's real much about it. I know the temple and they they didn't they kill virgins. I
*  Don't think they killed well, who knows this is great. I don't know about this topic
*  I don't know if they really know what exact people they killed they killed a lot of people
*  But what's really interesting is how beautiful their structures were like these amazing structures
*  I thought one of their pyramid like those big yeah, I thought one of them was for murder for their crops
*  They've they've speculated that there were certain platforms that they would do
*  Sacrifices on the Aztecs did I think the most sacrifices in one day and or it was like a couple of days
*  They they killed somewhere around I want to say I
*  Want I want to say more than 80,000 people they sacrificed when they yeah when they completed this
*  One of the temples how do you kill that many people that they bury them?
*  They just killed them one after another that takes a lot of the victims of human sacrifice by
*  Mexico's ancient Mayans who threw children into water-filled caverns were likely
*  boys and young men not virgin girls as previously believed
*  So wow, they would human sacrifice by throwing children into water-filled caverns. I could see how they could
*  Can you imagine that like you you you believe in superstition so much you want to drown a kid
*  So that so that the crops come back. That's a sign you people feeling out of control
*  They don't know the answers to something they can't figure out
*  But how crazy is it the people in almost all religions, especially the ancient ones?
*  They they lean towards these really ridiculous things like that. Yeah
*  Who's sacrifice brings that up? But what if we do this? Yeah killer kids?
*  Yeah, so make a sacrilegic like Cain and Abel right and if your God wanted that your God wanted you to kill your children
*  That's a horrible God that you're or how about your God tells you to kill somebody when you're about to he says no stop
*  I was just testing. Yeah, that's a fucked up story
*  Mean that is people to act like that's a normal story
*  That's the God that makes the universe told you to murder somebody and since you said yes
*  You did the right thing by saying yes
*  Because you have to trust God even if God tells you something that you can't imagine is real, right?
*  Even if you know in your gut, it's wrong to murder your kid
*  You have to murder your kid because God's telling you to and you were about to you like, okay good
*  I was just checking bro. Hot hot hot hot. I
*  Like you now just check the biggest bully asshole. Oh
*  Metzger is actually a religious genius. Yeah, he knows a lot about religion
*  And he was explaining to me the story of he gave me a much better understanding of the story
*  Where I think his name is Elisha these kids were yelling at him and they called him bald head. He's a bald guy
*  Yeah, and so he asked God to sick a she bear on the kids and it killed like 40 kids
*  She there this I wish I could remember exactly what what Metzger how he explained it to me
*  But it was the the insult was much worse than just calling him bald head
*  You just have to you have to put it into perspective with the time
*  Like the way he was saying it to him was much worse than we would imagine
*  Term would be we're looking at it in terms of modern language
*  But am I still the guy said God sicked a bear on these fucking kids
*  I think you're saying that it might might have meant that they actually were trying to kill the man
*  Yeah from there Elisha went to Bethel as he was walking along the road some boys came out of town and jittered him
*  Get out here Baldy. They said get out of here Baldy. He turned around and looked at the okay the curse
*  This is this I think that's a real weird translation. I don't think that's the the best translation the way I've heard it before is not
*  Written exactly that way did they have more than one translation?
*  translation
*  He turned around looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord the two bears came out
*  Of the woods and mauled 42 of the boys. I
*  Got a bear story. It seemed when I heard it before God, maybe I'm wrong, but if it felt like it was
*  In the ancient way of saying it and that was what Metzger explained to me see if there's finally got another
*  There's another there's another way of putting the words together that Metzger was saying it know they were gonna kill him
*  Version that has like tons of translations of it. Holy shit. So there's lots of versions
*  Unless they were trying to kill the guy
*  Maybe we're looking at it wrong and they were actually trying to kill the guy and I think that's one of the things that Metzger
*  Was trying to say like they were threatening violence to the guy
*  Sent a bear since I think two bears didn't say two bears. Yeah, this is two female bears two she bears dude
*  I was a call due to Baldy. He's six bears on you. Don't fuck with him again
*  That's rude. I was in a tent in the woods Yosemite and I was with this girl, you know stating and
*  That before we packed up the Ranger. I was like, hey don't have any food
*  Anywhere tied up in a tree those bears are coming out of their hibernation and they're hungry
*  Don't have a gum in your pocket, you know really scared us
*  We were the little group and we're kind of laughing that night like whatever like bear and just try to scare everybody
*  And then it's a horror movie. It is
*  Yeah, you're about to get murder always giggling about something yeah, so we're in the tent and about an hour into sleep
*  I had brought a knife in my you know tent this this size
*  Snout pushes into the tent puffs her head like her head went
*  Then it comes over to my head puffs my head. Oh and I had the thought
*  Oh, this is what terror feels like because I'd never felt the emotion before I'd never actually been terrified to that moment
*  And we just held each other's hands like really hard and just you did everything not to breathe for two hours just
*  Making the smallest amount of air come in your body. I have a theory about that
*  I think bears are figuring out that there's meat in those bags. I
*  Think they figured out that there's just like just like they find like when bears go to garbage cans
*  Yeah, you can't you can't scare them off
*  They're always gonna keep coming back to that garbage can once they go to the garbage can they become a problem
*  They have to kidnap them and move them to some sanctuary somewhere
*  Otherwise, they'd have to euthanize them because once they know where something is they keep going back
*  Yeah, they're not scared bears that have killed people in tents. They keep coming back. They keep coming back to tents. Yeah
*  We had to kill those I've heard of more than one
*  Different story about a predatory black bear attacking people in a tent
*  And I think is there's less deer in the place if there's been a bad climate
*  There's not enough food. Why don't they attack us more? Do you mean like because we have guns?
*  That's the only reason why and in places where people don't hunt bears. They have way less fear of people
*  I mean, I think they would want to get us for food immediately like oh, there's some food
*  They don't know exactly what we are. We're not a part of their natural world. We only occur every now and then like
*  If you run into a grizzly bear in Alaska, you might be the first person that grizzly bears ever seen
*  They might not have any idea with you what you are
*  Yeah, so it's been a lie for nine years. He's never seen a person. That's totally possible. You saw grizzly man, right?
*  Yes, I did. It's one of the best comedies
*  Comedy ever it is so funny. It's a wall-to-wall laughs that scene where he's at the lake and the bears walk up to him
*  He's going no. Yeah bad. Yeah, someone told me I don't know this is true, but the Bears could sense
*  There was something wrong with him. That's why they didn't eat him earlier. They thought he was like it's some sort of I don't disease
*  I don't think those bears up there that aggressive because there's so much fish
*  And I think when when the when the fish runs dry, that's when they get real dangerous
*  Yeah, he went and he was there long after
*  They were supposed to be in hibernation
*  So the one bear that killed him was really hungry. It hadn't eaten enough food
*  Yeah, so it looked at anything and like he was just gonna eat everything that was in front of it
*  So it found him and killed him. So they were saying you should never be around
*  When those bears are in hibernation if you find one that should be in hibernation and it's not that's a desperate bear, okay
*  Dude the fuck of that
*  That whole movies just fuck that like why you doing that?
*  Why are you camping where you know the Bears walk and he's not saving any barely even saving these bears. He was so crazy
*  Tiger King he was he was very similar. I got together with Tiger King. That'd be a great
*  You know what's similar about it. There's something about weird guys to get really connected to murderous animals
*  There's some sexual. Yeah some weird shit whether it's a tiger or grizzly bear
*  I'm here protecting them. Yeah, like this dude is in Alaska in a paper house
*  Right, he's got a spit in a cloth and he's he's laying on top of the ground every night protecting these
*  Fucking 1200 pound wild dog things. Yeah, and he almost got the role of Woody and
*  Yeah, which is not true. It's not true. No, he's a crazy person
*  But he's also a crazy person that found like an a venue for his crazy that he did some good, too
*  And here's one thing that he did. It's good and I'm not being facetious that movies brilliant
*  It's an amazing piece of entertainment through that movie millions of people have been entertained
*  I don't think he would have been able to do that without that. So in it was funnier than cheers
*  It was fucking great
*  In that guy's dying that way. It's a tragic story. It's a it's a lesson to be learned and
*  It's also hilarious. There's there's it's Phil. He did it on purpose
*  Warner hers are really smart guy. He made that thing funny on purpose
*  You think so when that sheriff looks at the camera goes, I thought he was retarded
*  Tell me tell me that wasn't like a scene in a fucking yeah, you know a Coen Brothers movie he was
*  Very he dangled that tape in front of the poor guy's mother. He was like, oh you don't want to listen to this
*  He can yeah that yeah. Yeah, that was crazy
*  When they played the there's an audio apparently of the death
*  It's not available online because we're in a Herzog told him to destroy it and I think he's probably right
*  But it's long man the bear is eating them just they eat him alive
*  That's maybe the worst way to go. Maybe fire. I don't the problem with a bear eating your lives
*  I think it takes a long time
*  Yeah, cuz they're not gonna kill you ever like a tiger would just kill you quick
*  Yeah, they grab your neck right bears start eating you from your feet down, you know, they don't give a fuck
*  Let's start hearing your tearing your fucking crotch apart while you're alive
*  yeah that and
*  Dude, you understand what that'd be like to watch a bear eat you dick first
*  Dick that's how you die. Thank dick first a bear just right at your crotch
*  Big fucking giant bear head clamped down on your dick in your asshole
*  And you're going no and that's how you die a lot of people have died that way man
*  I guarantee you if you how many people got attacked dick first
*  By giant grizzly bears over the course of the last 20,000 years. I bet it would be a
*  Number it's a prize you yeah, he'd be like, why are we keeping these things around?
*  That's one thing California did is really wise they exterminated all the grizzly bears. Is that right?
*  It's on the flag grizzly bears on the flag. There's no grizzly bears here. I didn't know that they're like fuck you
*  Hey, you keep eating us. Hey
*  Are you a big camp? Do you go camping?
*  I have I like I like rooftop camps like we could camp on the rooftop
*  They have rooftop tents that could have a roof rack on my Land Cruiser
*  Oh, I want to be a car. Yep climb up with a ladder
*  I want to get that way you're camping but things aren't just gonna fucking crawl up on you
*  Yeah, you know, I'll get that cyber truck because I had a great camping situation. Plus you look like you're in the future
*  Yeah, fucking camping in that thing. I fucking that's some Blade Runner shit. I love my car
*  Like in a way that I've never liked something I've bought before it feels like
*  It's another thing right like it's way better than a car
*  It is and it's learning and getting better and it feels like a child learn growing up and help
*  Yeah, you keep getting these new updates. Yeah, and it Christmas it drives itself and go doodoo just drives itself amazing
*  Cuz I bought mine in
*  2018 and
*  How it's gotten so much better
*  I mean they're solving vision which I think should be bigger news than what it is and
*  The way they they're doing it is brilliantly have people paid the money for them to send out all these fleets and they get all the data
*  yeah, this is what they need tons and tons of data and
*  It's they see stoplights and stop signs now
*  I kind of watched a video on how they they did this and it's
*  They send out to the fleet like hey send us all your stop signs and they all come back
*  To this one place and it learns and that I got a stop sign in near my house
*  And just a little piece of showing is covered by bushes and the but the car
*  recognizes it to
*  Just and that's his side job that that's his side job
*  He is the coolest person ever on paper paper. I mean in person, you know, he's uh
*  Yeah, I think Nikola Tesla is probably the most important inventor of all time
*  but
*  Nikola Tesla, I don't think you would think he's cool
*  You know, he was just a genius and he was like he was in love with a pigeon. He was really crazy
*  I really crazy he's a really crazy guy, but brilliant, but had ideas
*  Eli is like cool. You can hang out with him. It's super cool. Yeah, he was here
*  Smoking one of these he got in trouble for about 24 hours and they made money
*  bounce back
*  They lost six for their stock lock six lost six percent is that right? Yeah, but it came back nine percent the next day
*  Yeah, and i'm like, yeah people are crazy. You know, he's the greatest ceo. He's always in the news
*  But the fact that the tesla thing is like his side gig is what's most ridiculous. He is the coolest person ever
*  In the history also very important
*  He's doing very important things. Fuck. Yeah, man
*  We would be so far behind if it wasn't for one guy
*  What would the electric car market look like today if it wasn't for one guy, right?
*  And they tried to kill. I mean you just yes, I mean still happens
*  We get the worst news every car crash tesla crash on the news and when there was fires
*  Which there are anymore and there was only like a few everyone was front page and people thought don't those cars blow up
*  Yeah, yes. It's like you know many gasoline cars fires there were that year when you saw two
*  anyway, I just get uh
*  The fact that they made such an amazing car and got past all the bullshit
*  That was coming at him to destroy it. He just doesn't listen. He's he's like i'm smarter than you
*  So he just keeps going. They're stupid people. He knows what he's doing and he's been right so far
*  We're fucking lucky that guy's around now and I I don't like people give him shit
*  I mean they should be promoting and hiding the fires and the guy ahead of the um, the board that uh,
*  Looks into crashes. I don't know. I sound like an idiot. Uh, what's the name of that board? Anyway?
*  You would think you'd go. Oh, i've got this car. That's 15 times safer than all my other cars
*  Let's help this company out. But every I think they they investigate 500 crashes a year this department
*  Every tesla crash they investigate
*  You know, he's he's just on him and I understand you have to in a way
*  With the self-driving you have to really top that but yeah
*  But they've not been reckless about that and well, there's some there's some accidents though
*  That are very troubling one of them was a guy slams right into the side of a truck. I saw that
*  Yeah, that one didn't make any sense
*  That one was like how does it not know there's a truck in the road?
*  But or does it not know what to do when a truck is in the road? Like what happens like a truck tips over?
*  What do we do? Yeah, you don't know what to do. Why are you driving? Right? Like that's crazy
*  Yeah, like it's not ready for you to drive yet if it doesn't know where to truck
*  But you are supposed to pay attention it isn't it isn't self-driving yet. I think people text and fucking email and shit
*  I've dosed it's not good
*  Long drive. I went to phoenix. It's so bad. I had a seven-hour drive and I was like
*  But I I pulled over but I that car it's easy to
*  Pay attention. Well, it's it's just a different kind of thing
*  It's like you think of what a car is you think of uh, you know an engine and it pumps gas and you're driving around in it
*  That thing is like an electronic vehicle like it's not a car. It doesn't make any noise
*  It's amazing. It looks just like a car. But where's your engine? It's like where's the rumble?
*  Where's the where's that stinky gas? Right doesn't have any of those things. That's silent
*  That's what I noticed when we look back at horses and we're like, how do people stand the stink of shit in new york city?
*  But then when you get an electric car you go. Oh those other ones that was poison
*  I would just get used to it and I was like, oh, that's what they have
*  Yeah, when people just rode horses, this must have smelled terrible everywhere just horse shit everywhere. It'd be like
*  Yeah, I mean
*  Really, right? It would shit they'd shit all over the place if everybody was on a horse
*  yeah, but they got to get we got to get with the new technology because
*  I mean them trying to save coal jobs. I get it and that's a really tough thing
*  But we got a better off training and it's like them trying to save the the horseshoe guys business
*  Like we're not going that way
*  Do you know the whole learn to code fiasco online?
*  well
*  Someone was talking about uh coal miners and like what what they could do
*  You know if they stopped mining coal and someone had said learn to code
*  Yeah, and then learn to code somehow
*  I know I'm probably fucking this up but became like a bad thing that you couldn't say on twitter like an insulting thing
*  That would get you banned from twitter
*  Why?
*  Because learn to code was some sort of an insult it became some sort of an insult or mocking this idea that these people so
*  You would you you can't I mean it seems like the most innocuous of sentences learn to code
*  Is there anything wrong with learning? No, is there anything wrong with learning code? No, there's not
*  So how come I can't say learn to code?
*  I can't say it because at one point in time it was used to describe this one thing
*  Now it can be kind of become funny learn to code. Yeah, I don't yeah, I don't understand why that's bad
*  It seems like good advice. It seems like good advice always
*  But I mean maybe it's mean to say to these coal miners they should learn to code
*  I got that but you could also use that in a lot of different ways once someone said learn to code and sounds good
*  Um, that's not limited to that one meaning right you can say it as a friend like as a joke
*  Like learn to code and you're not you're not being an asshole
*  Like your friend is like, oh my fucking job is so annoying and you like learn to code
*  Yeah, you should get kicked off twitter. Yeah, they took the whole phrase by one person
*  Saying it right now that phrase is locked up. I mean, it's an unusual phrase. I know I use it a lot
*  lardicade learned to code
*  Why can't you say it? I don't know but I love tesla's there's just too many breaks being put on what people can and can't say
*  Like um, I don't know how much of this is legit because I know that
*  google
*  What is exactly the reason why the federalists?
*  And there was another thing that was
*  Explained how that that worked jamie how they were pulled down
*  They had an issue. It says with their adsense. So like that's what google controls is adsense
*  You know, right the money that you make off of your website clips, right? So there was a issue with it says
*  Uh
*  Zero hedge and federalists both had
*  Comment pages, I guess that had adsense on it and there was threats of having it taken away from them
*  And this article says that the federalist bends a knee to big tech and deletes its awful comment section
*  So I was trying to read through it to see
*  Goes back to what we were talking about earlier. It's the worst way to talk to people
*  Just through text like oh, yes, it's a perfect example comment section on a website or an example of why typing something out
*  In print is the absolute worst way to communicate with people. Yeah, how many times do you think that you could have had like a disagreement?
*  with someone
*  Through text messages, but in person you could have like come to an agreement pretty easily all the time
*  I i've run into that problem. I I now know not to text if it's anything that could be taken as a call
*  Yeah, facetime is even better just to like see their face facetime is good
*  A lot of the kids are doing the facetime these days. They just they just facetime you out of the blue
*  Like that's what a lot of people do now. I'm like, okay
*  I feel very aggressive when someone facetimes me it is but some guys like it
*  Yeah, okay now with this covet i've been getting way more used to it because of all the zooming i'm doing
*  That's the worry though
*  The worry is that this separates people even more from the emotional contact that we get the emotional interaction
*  We get from an actual human being and we get more and more douchey. What is
*  What do you get extra because I don't know the answer this i'm zooming with you or i'm here now with you
*  What am I getting extra?
*  Besides the whiskey and being in person with a person it's a different feeling like I know you're right there
*  Yeah, you know high five
*  There you are. We're right there
*  This that's different. I don't think you can get a code from contact anymore contacting services. I don't I I just fit in your face
*  I lost my caring about any of this you covered
*  I in the beginning really did care and I was really scared and I bought it and then I
*  Just hit a thing where you called it care fatigue
*  Care fatigue I got is there a word for that there should be I think what you just invented it
*  Oh, that'd be cool if I yeah, it's care. I think it's care fatigue. Is that a thing?
*  It's probably already look we found the female lumberjack was already a thing. This is probably already a thing, too
*  I want to i'm gonna make care fatigue. There's an article called compassion fatigue and there's a compassion fatigue awareness. That's different
*  That's different. My thing's different, but compassion fatigue makes sense too because most people
*  You know, they don't have so much to give to other folks
*  So busy like like christin bell people like the who was in the video. Yeah, it's like they really are
*  Um putting themselves out there and getting really crushed and if I were them i'm after the first
*  Text I did that I got blowback. I would I would be out
*  Yeah
*  um
*  I think that world the world of actors and actresses
*  I think it's very difficult for them
*  To gauge
*  How other people view someone who's really famous?
*  Who does something like that?
*  Like you you have to understand they I don't think they thought about the skepticism
*  I don't think they thought about people looking at it very cynically. I don't think they considered that no
*  I think they only thought like they probably talked to their friends like we're gonna make a difference
*  We're gonna make a difference with this video. Yeah, my friends like you're amazing. You're so powerful
*  If anyone can make a difference, it's you girl you have the platform music boom next thing
*  You know, they're they're making this video and they're calling their friends just like the one with galgadot same thing
*  You call your friends. We got this we got this we're gonna cure this people are fucking dropping like flies in italy
*  Falling off balconies and shit imagine. There's no heaven that one
*  That I also feel bad in a way because if someone your friend asks you do something it's hard to say no sometimes
*  You gotta tell them this is how I would make fun of you
*  You gotta realize what you're doing is crazy. I understand that the sentiment behind it is great
*  Yes, they all mean well, they all mean well and for white people when it comes to stuff like that
*  Look all white people feel guilty
*  for something
*  They just do yeah because
*  Black people used to be slaves. So just that
*  Just that alone if you did not come from that
*  There's some sort of guilt that you're connected to the ancestors that enslaved those people there's something in the back of your head
*  Yeah, especially if you're from old
*  Family like if your family's been in this country for fucking since the 1500s or some shit like for sure
*  Your family had something to do with slavery for sure
*  The white guild is real and it's getting pumped up right now
*  I mean there's videos of uh, there's a video guy and he just was joking around black guy
*  He goes kneel before me and praise like by and she's like kneeling and
*  it's uh, yeah, there's a bunch of those videos just videos of uh,
*  These people kissing this black dude's feet. I don't I don't think this is good for black people
*  You know what I mean? Like like what is this?
*  It's fine if it's just kissing feet kneeling. We're fine. Is it
*  I i'm not smart is it good that this
*  I think it's great that white people are marching with them and that's seems good
*  This is what it is, man. Society and people are getting we're getting better, but we get better like this
*  Oh, yeah the pendulum we get better in waves
*  Like it goes this way and it comes back and right now we're in a crazy period
*  But ultimately I think what's going to come out of it is way less racism
*  We're hitting a new stage of no racism people are always going to judge people
*  They're going to judge people on everything, you know judge people based on the language you speak
*  Where are you from whether you're short or tall or fat or skinny people just judge people
*  They're always going to judge people
*  It will become more and more taboo and more and more
*  Disgusting to people if you judge people on race now. It's like a new blip in the consciousness. It's a more
*  disgusting
*  crime to actually
*  Judge people and limit who you think they their potential as a human being
*  because they're from southeast asia or they're from mexico or they're from like
*  That that's going to become a disgusting trait. Well that something good can come out of this something good will come out of this
*  It's always been a disgusting trait, but it's going to it's going to reach a new level of it
*  Yeah, not tolerating. Yeah, you're always going to have some racists. You're always going to have some murderers. He was going to have some bank thieves
*  Yeah, they're always going to exist. It's like how about how do you make it?
*  Better for everybody. I do you find that police job. It's like yeah, that's the best thing
*  But this is it's happening right now like people are getting I really believe this the positive side of me
*  Says I really feel like we're going to come out of this on the other end friendlier to each other and we could do that
*  It's 100 possible
*  Good the salt can this can be a good thing like the the horrors of all this can make us appreciate
*  That things can go sideways so the the folks who have fortunately survived we can do better
*  We just got to survive that pendulum swing. Yes, like the al franken the me too al franken
*  That was a weird one went a little too far in that swing in my opinion. Oh, that was a weird one
*  I mean he was the worst thing he was accused of is
*  The way he held the woman while he was taking a photo with her and then there was the girl who was on the
*  The girl who was on the plane with them though. Yeah, lian tweedon. That's her name, right?
*  Yeah, yes, let's go with lian tweedon. I'm so high
*  I can't believe my fucked up. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm not high at all. I have no excuse
*  She's got the best um
*  She's got the best uh
*  Case because yeah, what is her is different like there's a photo of him
*  Look at that photo. All right now hands over her breasts while she's sleeping
*  Like come on man, if that was your girlfriend
*  Yeah, no, that is but that's him is when he was a comic he did something they were on a comedy tour
*  Yes, they're on a comedy. He did something stupid and i'm not i'm not defending but she's wearing a flak
*  Jacket, yes, and he's not touching her but he's pretending he is maybe he thought it was funny. Maybe she didn't I get it
*  It's I don't it's not a good look, but it's not it's not a good look. I don't think he's an evil person
*  No, I just think nothing got fired. He resigned under pressure. But yeah, I just um, I think he's just a smart, uh,
*  guy and I don't know
*  Well, that's the he got caught up in that wave, you know, and I think um, that can happen to folks
*  I think she even was like I I didn't want him to resign. I might I should stop talking i'm saying things
*  You didn't want who to resign to say shiva
*  Yeah, she didn't want shiva to resign. She didn't want him to lose his job over that
*  She I think she came out and said yeah, I don't think she did either again
*  No information. Yeah, it's you know
*  There's way worse people out there
*  Yeah, that's what's
*  fucked up when you find like like, you know
*  When you hear about a guy like harvey weinstein, right?
*  And you realize like wow like just the sheer numbers of people
*  Fucked with yeah, you know, like there are really people like that. Yeah cosby
*  Cos one of the greatest comedians ever even better rapist even in terms of all time
*  Like they got the the years
*  Uh, see anybody says that there's nothing ever funny about rape didn't hear that
*  Uh, yeah, because that was funny and you're not trying to be mean. No, I probably will get in trouble though
*  Yeah, you probably will. Yeah, but it was funny and most people are reasonable and they're gonna understand what we're doing here
*  I can't get cancelled but that's not true. You can retro get cancelled
*  if you get like a job on a
*  Yes show then they come back they come back and read your 2004 tweet. Remember you said rape was great on show rogans, right?
*  I'm sorry
*  And the goalposts keep getting moved like things that you could say like readily one of the things i've been doing is i've been watching a lot of adam sandler movies
*  Yeah, it's funny during oh my god, man
*  Some of them are so funny like zohan is one of the funniest fucking movies ever but like
*  Wildly inappropriate and just just even then like the things that you can get away with saying then you can't do now
*  No, you know like when rob schneider and adam sandler's movies
*  When rob schneider and adam sandler's movies, he would play a bunch of different races all kinds of he played asian guys
*  He played he played all kinds of weird dudes
*  You can't you barely can do that today. Do you think ever again?
*  Will it swing back where people go? Yeah, you can do other blackface is fine blackface would never be fine
*  Never be fine, but he apparently was it was not I I mean 80s
*  That's 90s. It was like not not that big a deal. You didn't think like oh my god. You're yeah
*  well, obviously
*  Black people say that's example or evidence of white people being
*  Insensitive right that you don't realize how offensive it is to put on paint to pretend to be like us
*  I didn't know I had no idea black people when they saw like someone dressed up as bill cosby like a white guy
*  We're mad about I I really didn't know right. It's well, what's confused if you don't have a good sense of history
*  Yeah, you think of it and you go well if I saw a black guy dressed like a white guy like what would I give a fuck?
*  Yeah, but then you have to go to like those al jolson movies those that blackface was
*  Weird different I feel like dude it was cartoonish and strange and black people couldn't act in movies
*  So they had white people right dress up and put paint on their face so that they look like a black person
*  To me, it's like I understand that people think that's offensive. I understand that it's offensive to you. I get it
*  But when I watched that to me it is
*  fucking fascinating
*  Like almost in a scientific sense like you're looking at a different version of human beings
*  right you're looking at these people that are just really interested in people dancing and running around and
*  Doing so with this weird
*  Paint on their face. That's him dehumanizing. So weird man. So weird and it was like
*  They praised him. He went backstage. They're like great job. Yeah, man. Let me hear some of this shit
*  Can I hear some of it? Yeah, I can't no nothing. We got trouble. I'll tell you
*  Damn it. Jamie should be in public domain, but it's not so okay. Sorry
*  Well when my heart goes out to you when you look at him like it's so strange looking
*  Give me a little
*  Imagine sorry, he's like I I like the way black people look but
*  Their music's too good. So what I'm gonna do is do like a
*  A white guy version it is and just a black guy and I'm gonna do like whack white music
*  That's fucked. I mean how many like how many blues singers were alive back then?
*  That just had you know
*  That what year was this?
*  1927 I believe what how what year was Robert Johnson alive?
*  I
*  Find out Robert Johnson
*  That's the legendary blues man that the big legend of whether or not he sold the souls of the devil
*  Because he was so much better than everybody else same time. So here you go folks. This is how whack white people are
*  Jesus that's al jolson's pretending to be a black guy
*  while Robert Johnson is alive and making music
*  And Robert Johnson like that's the roots I think it's route 66 story
*  What's that? I forget what there's like a supposedly where he met the devil on the highway
*  Oh and that gave me and he sold his soul to the devil to be the greatest blues man ever
*  Like it's hard for us to to see
*  In the 2020 context when there's so much music man. There's so much brilliant music
*  There's the Beatles and fucking Sturgill Simpson and kiss and rolling stones
*  There's so much fucking music that you could just get on your phone at any time
*  But back then this one dude, Robert Johnson was so
*  Intoxicating that people thought that he had sold his soul to get that good
*  Ah, that was this that's a real legend man people thought about it
*  and he was just
*  Traveling around singing the blues and you can listen to it today, but it's hard to put it into perspective
*  Is his stuff?
*  public domain, uh
*  That's the thing is like it I'll pay for it because give us a little give us a little taste
*  But Robert Johnson, it's it's hard. It's like when you listen to Lenny Bruce comedy
*  It's hard for it to translate to today because the times are just so different
*  And this is the same thing with Robert Johnson, but you got to think in his day
*  Hey
*  Just recorded music was like 20 years old. Yeah, you know like nobody even knew they were recording like bethoven and shit on these big stupid discs
*  Yeah, when this is this is a guy that was
*  Way ahead of the curve. I want to hear this now. Come on, Jamie. Give me what could it be 40 grand?
*  Give me a touch. Not a big deal. Just give me a touch of Robert Johnson. How much can you cross before you go?
*  Robert
*  You
*  Dust on the ground and he's on the stage what year is that a whiskey 19? What was it 30?
*  It said he died in 38. So he had 27 so he wasn't even that old
*  He died at 27 years old. I died 27. So imagine this this and then this whack ass al jolson
*  Singing terrible songs and pretending to be a black guy at the exact same time that robert johnson was alive
*  Must have felt real good
*  Well, and then you got to think that robert johnson you're talking about a guy who was alive
*  60 like 60 years after slavery ended right? Yeah. Yeah, he was born in uh, 19
*  Does it say how he died 11 he was born in 1911. That's crazy
*  So was that 56
*  50ish years, that's when he's born after slavery ended right? So it's basically
*  the the divide
*  Between people that used to be slaves and regular folks is still so fucked up man. Yeah
*  One thing I was reading about that. I didn't know about was I reading or somebody told me this
*  that for the longest time after
*  Slavery one of the big things was they would just arrest black men for anything for loitering
*  Yeah, and then they would make them work for like pennies a day like they'd make them fucking break rocks and shit
*  So they give them these crazy sentences. So they basically kept them slaves. Yeah, they just arrested them a lot for shit
*  Yeah, and then imagine being a guy whose entire life you've been a slave now
*  You're 25 years old and they just let you free and you got to figure out how to get a job and nobody wants to hire
*  You and everybody's scared of you and everybody's prejudiced against you and yeah
*  There's no opportunities and then just start arresting you and making you break rocks you're like fuck it
*  Yeah
*  I thought you guys were gonna fix this like this isn't any better. This is worse
*  So a whole generation had to go through that. Yeah before it still got to the civil rights movement in the 60s
*  It's real crazy when you think about it. It's not that long not that long man. I am
*  I am
*  52 years old and I believe Michael yo had on his page
*  that
*  A year that like to the very year that I was born. Maybe I was alive for one year
*  Where it was illegal?
*  For a black man and a white woman to get married
*  Illegal so like the late 60s. Yeah
*  I didn't know that. Did you know that? No, I don't know anything dude. That's my lifetime
*  Yeah, I think I think I was a year old when they made it legal
*  Wow
*  Can you find out that's accurate?
*  Jamie what are you eating? It looks delicious. Come on, Jamie. Sure. What do you got there? Oh the
*  Neuro gum. What does that do? Is that makes you smarter? I need one so bad. Do you do too? I do as well
*  I know I'll smoke a joint and drink. Yeah, and then try to make good point, dude. We're making great points. Um, here we go
*  1967 so when I the year I was born
*  Interracial marriage in the united states has been fully legal in all u.s. States since 1967
*  There you go
*  So it's like that's not that long ago, man. That's not that long. Interesting history
*  Yeah, and we're still we're still getting over it. Yeah, it's
*  American Indians don't even start with that. I'm obsessed
*  You see you see that giant painting that I had out there that greg overton painting
*  No, that big white indian face when you walk in yes. Yes
*  I I
*  Got obsessed with the native american history obsessed. I don't know
*  Much about it. Can you enlighten me a little bit for uh, there's a book that you got to start with
*  This is the one that'll get you it's called empire the summer moon by this guy sg guen
*  It's fucking crazy
*  It's all about the comanches and all about how the mexicans tricked people in the settling into texas
*  Because they knew the comanches lived there and the comanches were going to kill them
*  They wanted to buffer between people the comanches so they gave them all this land like senor
*  Send these poor bastards out to be slaughtered
*  Wow. Oh my god, dude
*  it's the best book I think like in terms of like
*  like a
*  Perception shifting book the best book i've ever read. I actually listened to it on tape
*  I never thought I was gonna read I don't read anything. I read mostly magazines
*  I really I just mostly listen to books on tape, but this this one is so well written. It's so fascinating
*  and the the people that figured out how to
*  Conquer the comanches. Yeah, basically the guys that figured out how to use pistols
*  They had to change they had to change the way they did battle and they had to go against them on horseback
*  Comanches were so good at fighting on horseback. Yeah, and these dumb americans, they're the you know early americans
*  Yeah, why aren't you in a line? They would get off the they'd have to shoot their long rifle off their horse
*  So they have to dismount from their horse pull out their musket boom powder
*  Then they got to repack it
*  It takes a minute to repack it and these indians were just fucking them up
*  So they couldn't get past a certain point in the united states and that was texas
*  That's why texas is so fucking fierce today
*  Because the texas rangers were the first people to figure out how to fuck up the comanches
*  They lived like comanches. They made cold camps. They didn't light fires. They ate just bullshit. They survived they dressed like like
*  You know like regular people they did wear whatever the fuck they wanted and they figured out how to fight on horseback
*  And then they figured out how to use a colt revolver
*  And it was the only they were the only people using the revolver
*  Nobody saw use for something they could fire five times before it ran out of bullets
*  So this guy invented this revolver when he was like, I think he was like 16 years old or something crazy
*  Yeah, and the patent kind of floated around for a while and he made them but nobody really wanted them
*  But then these rangers kept fighting these comanches
*  They only had two muskets in their hand and one long one
*  So they had three shots and they had to get the fuck out of there. We can't beat these guys
*  They have like 20 arrows. This is fucked up. And so this
*  One guy got a hold of a colt revolver and then he goes hey, I think we just changed the game
*  They started fucking up these indians on horseback
*  Yeah, and they started conquering big chunks of land that they couldn't you know, the comanches were dominating before
*  It's crazy story man. That's the best one to start with because they were so ruthless to each other
*  I will
*  Listen to it. I I read I read so slow. I get panic attacks when there's a subtitles in a movie
*  I was in a school my parents kept trying to make me read faster
*  This was back before they saw if you had a reading problem. You just were dumb. You were an idiot, right? Period
*  And so they took me to this nun there were these nuns that had this reading machine that we heard about what so I yeah
*  So we drive like an hour and a half to go to this reading machine
*  What did you think it was before you got there? What was magic? I didn't know what it was gonna be
*  But it was like how old you at the time?
*  14 maybe you go into a reading machine
*  Yeah
*  And so it's a nun very sweet and it projects on the wall like one sentence at a time and it goes by
*  At a certain speed it's like one through ten speeds
*  And so she tests me where I am the first day and i'm i'm level one
*  I can only read the absolute slowest and she saw I was upset and she goes don't worry by the end
*  Of the summer you'll be on level 10
*  And I was like really?
*  So worked all summer end of the summer test. Guess what level I was on. I worked really hard. Yes, I was on one
*  And the her faith in god
*  drops off her face
*  I couldn't read and I still get angry when I read and I can't get it to this day
*  I read like this I had to go back and then I go this way
*  I guess words like I know how long believe is
*  But sometimes it's a different anyway, the problem is nobody recognized that you were actually a comedian that was trying to be a regular person
*  Yeah, that's what I was a normal person. That was the problem. Like what is he gonna do? I wish I was there
*  Well my my uh, I actually was very upset when I was like 12 years old
*  I was avoided class clown, but I wanted to be at that age. You want to be cool and liked by girls, you know
*  Yes, you don't be clown clown to me was was bad. I realized that's how they saw me. It was like tiny
*  they changed it to uh
*  Best personality because they heard that I was upset about it
*  And then um my mother proceeded to fill my room with clowns
*  Oh my god, my room was filled and I was I didn't really have a voice back then
*  I didn't really uh, what if for whatever reason I just let my mother fill my room with clowns
*  There was one painting of a clown reading the wall street journal and he was crying like he had clown he had stock
*  Like some clown had like stocks. Oh my god
*  Very upset about what was happening in the stock market. I was so high
*  I couldn't remember lianne tweeden's name
*  But how high was I I was thinking was was it louann but I know her she's nice
*  She's a nice person the account of uh, robert johnson's death is pretty crazy. Let's hear it
*  um
*  He yeah, I just lost it because I was looking at the devil legend too, which is pretty interesting but um
*  He uh, he went down so he those recordings
*  He did were almost near the end of his life because there wasn't obviously lots of recording back back then
*  um
*  He had it says he traveled to a plantation to perform
*  at a like dance party
*  And he was poisoned
*  By someone who he was having an affair with the guy's wife. Oh my god. I didn't know he had an ulcer
*  So he said he wasn't trying to kill him. He's trying to make him sick. The ulcer made him really sick. He bled
*  Oh
*  then the back of his death certificate
*  I'll let you read this part because it's pretty it like adds to it a little bit
*  It says it was written on the back of it this part right here. What part right here this paragraph in the middle
*  I can't see that well. Um, okay. It says I talked with the white man
*  Whose place this negro died and I also talked with the negro woman on the place the plantation owner said the negro man
*  Seemingly about 26 years old came from tunica two or three weeks before he died to play the banjo at a negro dance
*  Given there on the plantation he stayed in the house with some of the negroes
*  He wanted to pick cotton the white man did not have a doctor for this negro and he did not or he had worked
*  Excuse me as he had not worked for him
*  He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county the plantation owner said that was his option
*  Or that was his opinion that he died of syphilis
*  His sister then came got him out of that coffin
*  Tried to have his death looked into and no one really looked into it and that's about the end of that
*  And so somebody might have poisoned him. This wasn't found out until 30 years later. They thought he just disappeared
*  What? Yeah
*  What death wasn't reported publicly he disappeared from the historical record and wasn't until like 30 years later
*  Some people found his music and they found the dug into his life found his death certificate found out all those information way after the fact
*  Wow
*  So like this guy who everyone
*  Reveers as like one of the best musicians of all time
*  Wow, no formal autopsy was done
*  Hmm at the same time that's happening all that real shit al jolson's got white gloves on right making all the sweet cheese
*  He's doing movies and people are clapping. Yay. So talented
*  Do you imagine what white guilt was like back then? It must have been suffocating. I don't think there was any none
*  They know the ones who are aware they'd be like, oh my god, my race sucks were they what did we do?
*  That's an interesting thing
*  I've just further record that was on wikipedia that could have been organized and maybe the not most truthful way
*  But right that's how it was put in place, right?
*  I didn't know any of that man. That's interesting. I didn't know he was that young too. Yeah, but it's kind of funny man like that
*  It's just weird that just a few years ago
*  Jimmy kimmel didn't he do like carl malone didn't do like an impression. Yeah, that is that was okay interesting how
*  What do you think about going back and canceling? Well, it's hard
*  It's because like the context of the time is different when jimmy fowl was playing chris rock
*  I know you think it's offensive but it wasn't universally considered offensive to pretend to be someone of a different race
*  It wasn't like automatically thought of as you're trying to be racist if you pretend you're doing
*  You're pretending you're chris rock if you can do a chris rock impression
*  And you put makeup on your face that makes you look like an african-american
*  It wasn't it wasn't necessarily racist because you were pretending to be an actual human being right
*  Used to be different like we thought of it differently now
*  It's like universally thought across the board if you're a white person
*  You can't put black makeup on everyone's agreed to that
*  This is the new elevated standard and we all agree to it, right?
*  If you did it now, that would be right if you did now it's different if you decided now you're like fuck you your rules, man
*  I'm fucking crazy. Yeah, you know, that's that's really what's going on and back then
*  It wasn't a problem people thought it was funny like oh my god. That's jimmy fowl and pretending to be chris rock
*  Uh, yeah, you could do it. You could pretend to be mr
*  T when I was in high school like when I was in high school
*  You could put makeup on your face have gold chains around your neck and you could pretend did you ever do a black face?
*  Just in the 80s. I happen to not either I got lucky
*  Yeah, but you're right like it wasn't thought of as you didn't think oh i'm doing something bad
*  No, you didn't they I don't think they thought that and it's like where does that?
*  Where does that end like?
*  Like what what can what can you not pretend to be like as long as you like isn't intent what's really important?
*  I totally I I absolutely think it is important. I mean I
*  I think
*  Intent is what's important. It's not should be thing when things become taboo and superpowers
*  They become very dangerous
*  It's just weird because then people are so scared of saying it that they want to say it more
*  And then the race has had a more powerful weapon to them. Yeah, it's it's
*  And we don't have to let go new ones, you know
*  We've already lost certain words that we can never say again even in in in jest because they're so offensive that even uttering them
*  Is like an incantation for an ass kicking. Yeah, you're gonna call people to beat your ass. Yeah
*  Right. I mean, that's really what it's gonna have that option
*  But
*  The real problem is intent intent. It's like words are supposed to just be noises you make
*  That let other people know what you're thinking
*  That's all it's supposed to be
*  And when a word becomes like a super powerful word or a deed becomes a super powerful deed like a thing like that
*  That doesn't really hurt anybody like blackface
*  Like with that when you decide if you decided to be mike tyson for halloween and you're an italian guy
*  And you know and you had a fucking fake tattoo put on my fucking face so fucking you know, like well champ people would only think it's funny
*  You know if that's your intent, especially if you're an actual mike tyson fan
*  It's just weird that it's and it's because of their origins. It's because of al joseph al joseph and his shitty movies
*  For the whole reason movies. I mean how many blackface people were there back then was it that big of a deal?
*  I know there's an album cover with judy garland blackface. She was in blackface. No on an album cover. Oh my god
*  See, but like if there was none of that
*  If it was just right, right if it never existed
*  If just black people did their music and and they were just recognized as being musicians
*  And there was never like a white guy who tried to pretend he's black and do it and steal their thunder if that never existed
*  At all, you think it wouldn't be a problem. I don't think it would be a problem. I'm not sure
*  It's for the record it didn't start without jules and that was just the first time it was captured on film
*  So that's the first record
*  Only thing we have to look at. Oh, so how long it had been going on since the 1830s. Oh my god
*  So dude while slavery was still legal
*  Why people were pretending to be black people on stage and singing shitty songs?
*  It's just like they're not even trying to look like black people though, which is weird
*  They they've they came up with a caricature or cartoon. Yeah, look at that. That's that. Oh my god
*  W m h west's big minstrel jubilee now me
*  As a person just as a human being I understand the context of what would be offensive about this and where where we are today in
*  2020 and the progress we're making and all that stuff. I just gotta tell you for me as a person that is fascinating
*  I
*  Am fascinated by this as just the evolution of a of an animal of a human being of a culture where we're seeing the people
*  From that day what year is this like that picture was from 1900. I think okay, so 1900
*  So a hundred and twenty years ago the evolution of that
*  Version of a human being to our version of a human being
*  Yeah, we're very different from people that lived 120 years ago
*  And this is a great example of how different we are when you see stuff from that time
*  It's like I understand how it's offensive to people. I get it. I understand
*  It should be offensive. It should be offensive that people were treated that way. It should be however just as someone who's like watching
*  Like if you're watching a bird and exhibited really weird behavior a long time ago, then it stopped doing it
*  He'd be freaked out like wow, what happened? Why they stopped doing this? Like how they how did they evolve?
*  How are they different from the way they were back then?
*  Hmm if you got to if you could fucking have a time machine and go back and watch a minstrel show a live minstrel show
*  You and me we get high as fuck. We time travel time machine
*  Could you imagine sitting there watching that crazy nonsense?
*  Like a white guy with like black paint all over his face big exaggerated lips, and he's got white gloves
*  Singing these terrible songs
*  Yeah, it
*  It's weird that those those things happen, but it's that would actually be a
*  fascinating
*  oculus rift
*  game
*  Wait a minute what yeah, yeah, if you could put a game
*  Like one of those oculus rift things if you could put a helmet on and it would just transport you back in time
*  Not just to this place, but like to Egypt. How about that? How about you're in ancient Egypt and
*  Like 2000 BC with Cleopatra. Yeah, actually she lived in like the A.D.S
*  10,000 a day she lived in the A.D.S. Cleopatra. I think I'm not a good example. I went to those
*  Festivals we call those
*  And they're having this big like here you show and the guys on stage and there's people
*  You know dressed up watching and I wanted so bad to go up in my now clothes from backstage
*  I could have got backstage big everybody I'm from the future
*  And they'd have to continue to pretend they're from the olden times and be like in the future
*  People make fun of you and they do these festivals and they're a bunch of nerds who act like you and they would have to
*  Continue to go where you from the future sir. They couldn't break character. Anyway, I was too scared to do it
*  Do you think they'll ever have a millennial festival like they have a festival?
*  On their phone being a dick
*  I'm an activist. Yeah, look at all the hashtags. I use
*  You know what? I think some version of that will happen
*  I'm having 80s parties. No. Well, that's what I think about
*  What's happening with us and this is this is a good way to look at it
*  We're talking about these ripples and waves and ups and downs and we're experiencing a big crazy shift
*  All that though, I think on the other end comes out better
*  I think it comes out better for everybody. I really do. I think all this this
*  Horrible shit that's happening to us right now is a culture
*  Needs to happen so we can
*  Be nicer to each other. It's totally that would be great
*  It's totally possible
*  It can a hundred percent be the outcome and I think it is gonna be the outcome because if you look at all these people that
*  Are peacefully marching versus the people that are looting and all the crazy shit. Yeah, the numbers are overwhelming
*  Most people are peacefully marching. I want people to my brother's a cop so I like
*  You know, I really feel defensive of him because he's just such a good cop and a good guy and
*  I just feel like God the news is just making things. They're going a little overboard with bro. They canceled Paw Patrol
*  Do you understand this that's how serious they are being police. Mm-hmm. That's how seriously well one of them is also a fire person
*  There's a they have different jobs. They canceled Paw Patrol because of the cop part
*  That's bro
*  They canceled the show cops the most reality
*  Right all reality shows that's a good way to show you what cops are most cops are doing and most criminals
*  We got to know about look the like we really need the best confirmation that we ever got about Florida man
*  Came from cops
*  Yeah, that account like all those accounts the like Twitter accounts and Instagram accounts to show all the crazy shit that Florida guys do
*  Yeah, all that most of it came from that. Yeah. Yeah
*  I want to it's also hard to even def or sort of bring injuries in the conversation
*  Cops and what they're dealing with because yes, cuz it's like you're
*  You're not on the right side. Like I I am for you know, black lives matter
*  But but I also just want to introduce there's so much coming at cops right now
*  I mean there they go up to these cars
*  Terrified like how you go through a haunted house
*  You know a lot of it is is bad train. They're not getting enough training
*  Yeah, they're not you know, they're really scared and they have a gun and so when you start wrestling with someone's got a gun
*  Suddenly who knows who has the gun and it's a from that point on it's a and they don't have a whole lot of physical
*  Requirements on how much they learn martial arts or no retention or any of that stuff
*  I don't know and also now you can't you know, you to control the head control the body. Yeah, and now you can't
*  Can't choke anymore. And look and the guy who died
*  Eric Garner Gardner, that's the one in New York. Yeah, he actually he didn't die from the choke
*  I think a lot of people think he did they were sitting on they were like leaning on him
*  He couldn't breathe. Yeah, but he was also being choked but no but not while no that was listen
*  That thing around the arm around the head. Yeah, no one stays there. They don't stay there
*  You have to hold them you have to squeeze them when you squeeze him you're choking them if I hold you like that
*  I'm not I'm not putting you to sleep, but I'm slowly
*  Choking it. Yeah, if a guy has a guy the way that cop had Eric Garner down if I basically remember correctly
*  He was using like a gable grip and rad as it wasn't a full make rear naked choke or is choking him to sleep
*  But he was holding this across the neck and I would say anybody who doesn't think that that's a choke
*  Let me put it on you. Let me put it on you lie on the ground and I'll grab your neck like that
*  I'm telling you it's a choke
*  I could be wrong
*  but if I remember the video that he did the choke and once he got on the ground he left the
*  He the guy actually didn't die from do we have that video? I think that one you're correct
*  I think Eric Garner died from a heart attack, but they were like they were leaning or sitting on there on it
*  But I was also crazy because it was for loose cigarettes
*  But my point is like if someone is holding your head like that. It's it's a choke
*  It just is you know it might it nuts
*  It's not full choke where you're going to sleep
*  But if someone has you in a position where they're on top of you you're on your stomach
*  Okay, so all their weight is on you which makes it very hard to breathe already. Yeah, that guy's wrapping his arm
*  No, I'm saying he's on the ground
*  Yes, he is left arm in that one is not totally under the neck. So that one is see how that is
*  That's that is a choke. Yeah, look at look at his hands. See his hands are gripped together
*  Let me show you what I'm doing right here look at this see this yeah, this is 100% a choke. Yeah 100%
*  There's no if fans or butts about it. That's a fucking choke anybody who doesn't think that let me put it on you
*  That's a choke that's under the neck. That's worse than I thought it was that is a 100% choke
*  I could be wrong, but if you go forward in the video, I don't think the choke that he's doing on him and
*  I understand what you're saying
*  But if but he's this is he shouldn't have done it at all man
*  That's the thing they like if that is what caused him to die and we don't know if that was or if it was the people
*  On top of them or was the stress the event or it was a combination of all those things
*  But that had to play a factor that choking that dude and why over loose cigarettes?
*  That's the most important part of that story. Look, I'm not
*  Crazy, I'm not in defense of this situation
*  I was just making the point that like sometimes when if you take away from a cop the ability to
*  I mean it also they're not even gonna
*  If someone if you had a gun and someone is going after you you have to assume they might kill you
*  You do anything you can in that situation that situation is not a good example
*  I was just making the point that the he actually didn't die from that that he died from there and they were like leaning on him
*  But we don't know that though, here's the thing man the way he's on that guy's neck that guy's big
*  Look at the guy was doing that go back to that real quick for a second
*  The guy who's doing that choke has some big-ass fucking arms, dude. He's got some big fucking strong. Look at that guy's arm
*  That's a strong motherfucker man. All those muscles around where his elbows that guy will choke the shit out of you
*  Look at his shoulders. Look at his triceps
*  I am telling you if that guy is trained in something and it seems like is I guarantee he's strong as fuck
*  That is a rough thing to go through my friend. I'm telling you so I don't deny
*  You can't say if you're seeing that you're definitely seeing that you're looking right at it
*  You can't say that's not what killed him because if that guy is holding on we don't know how long I don't know how long
*  He's holding on for he's alive after this
*  Maybe he had a heart attack because of that that's possible because this dude is on him like a pit bull and
*  For what loose cigarettes? Yeah, it's fucking crazy. It's the craziest story. I
*  Want to make it clear? I'm not pro this story. My point is I know you're not yeah this um
*  But we forget what things really looked like I do it all the time. I need to look at it again
*  I go. Oh, I didn't know it was like that. Yeah, I have I just like
*  I just know if you're in a situation where
*  What's up, Jamie pop patrol thing? I was gonna say did they bring it back? It's a troll all this motherfuckers got me
*  No
*  What happened they got me pop patrol was a troll what they weren't really?
*  They got me you got me you fucks, but here's the thing man the cops was cops real
*  It's all cop but in my eyes
*  There's something about cops that was always mocking these poor fucks that are getting arrested
*  Even the theme song bad boys bad boys what you're gonna do what you're gonna do when they come for you
*  They made it funny
*  They made it funny to watch these cops pull over these bumbling rednecks with those fucking red plastic cups
*  They're beating each other up. Yeah great show. It was a crazy show
*  31 years is probably the longest-running show next to the Simpsons right?
*  This is not a troll though. This is a breaking news as California governor orders all citizens to wear face masks
*  All public places
*  How did we go backwards I'll tell you how protests no one's saying it
*  Don't spread it. Don't worry. Whatever you do. Don't try to get your job back you piece of shit
*  Are you guys demonstrating you're killing grandma, but protests? It's like yay
*  So we're making a difference. Yeah. Yeah, there's also like cops were these heroes
*  You know in the parades
*  Frontline workers and a week later like you're an asshole
*  What all it takes is one or two bad cops and there's two in a row now that guy in Atlanta
*  Jamie was telling me the story that the guy knew that the taser that the
*  Gentlemen stole from him and ran away from him and like pointed the taser at him when they shot him
*  He knew the taser didn't work. Oh, really knew it had already been fired. They have
*  Apparently there's video which had not I didn't see they've only shown photos after they shot him
*  They didn't do anything for like two minutes
*  Or some one of them tried to help but the other ones like they stood on them
*  I heard they kicked them. Yeah, I heard someone kicked him. Yeah, dude
*  It's the best example for why we should have something other than the cops for drunk people
*  Like someone who's like a nice guy was a counselor
*  Comes in talks to you. Is it only one guy? Yeah, he fell asleep in his car at the drive-thru. Okay, we're gonna send Mike
*  Mike's gonna be like hey man, you all right, you're actually Mike's
*  Probably all cops
*  Maybe not maybe Mike says listen, man, I'm gonna give you a ride home. We're gonna park your car right here
*  We're all good. That's a good your keys come back in the morning when you sober. Here's my number. Call me
*  I'll grab you. I'll pick you up. I'll bring you to the car also homeless. Maybe take that away from cops. Yeah
*  Homeless dealing with homeless. Yeah, that's you're right. You're right, right? That's a real different sort of crime. That's like a
*  Systemic poverty crime thing like there's something weird going on if that many people are
*  Homeless like what kind of it?
*  How fucked up is the balance of your your little community when 70,000 people are homeless?
*  Yeah, like LA has
*  Boulder but homeless inside of it really close
*  Boulders like a hundred thousand people LA's got more than 70,000 and growing homeless people
*  So the entire population of Boulder no house shove them into LA and there that tents under the you know
*  One of the freeways and stuff. They make little tents it is
*  I don't want those people to have to live like that, but I don't want them to live there either
*  You know, it's it's a two prong thing. It's like
*  How do you fix that? I don't know how you fix it once it gets started
*  You know, it's very difficult to give someone back their dignity and you know and to do it you'd almost like need one-on-one
*  individual attention with someone who's like a
*  counselor a babysitter someone's gonna straighten the person out and clean them up and
*  Get them to think better and get them to eat better and get them to drink water and stop shooting heroin into the dick and
*  Get a job and there's a she'd never shitting your dick. That's what happened to Harvey Weinstein. That's what I heard
*  We got a mushroom penis. Well
*  I
*  Unfortunately googled that disease and
*  Ho, you don't want to you don't want to do it. I don't even want to say what it's called
*  but it's a type of gangrene that
*  Diabetic men get if they get an infection in their
*  When they get an infection they get this horrible gangrene and there are some fucking images on there's some things that Google will sensor
*  Okay, but not but not green rotten dicks rotten dicks. It's open season
*  What about is it called with the the the type of gangrene called?
*  You should everyone should know about it, but no one should go look it up
*  Never I looked it up. Don't listen to me do whatever you want to do
*  You just need to know it's a real thing and that then someone texted me made might have been meds
*  Or someone texted me that they heard it was because Harvey was shooting coke into his dad. That's what I heard
*  So it's probably meds. He probably
*  A circle of lies for knees or four years. It's a it's a last name. I think it's what's capitalized
*  So four years gangrene and it's gangrene of the dick and you have been warned and it didn't slow him down
*  I kept one on my phone because I just I was so confused
*  We need to be pretty close to get something injected by his assistance to to get his heart up
*  Yeah, I just surprised that that didn't slow him down from his sexual assault
*  Holler at your boy
*  No, I don't even know what I'm look I'm not even offended cuz I don't know what I'm looking at meatballs and sausage
*  That's what you look at. What's that tongue thing coming? Exactly? Oh, no, dude
*  That's a fully rotten asshole like that guy rotted out from the top of his dick to his asshole
*  Yeah, I did I had a STD scare. I don't have an STD, but this is what happened
*  I woke up and the area right above my most precious area was a little puffy
*  So I called the doctor and lady goes, what do you want to see the doctor for?
*  I didn't know what to say, but I was this is what came out of me. I go I have a
*  puffy pubic area and she goes
*  Like a receptionist a doctor's off their job is to make you feel like oh, that's fine. I'll be a big area
*  We get those all the time. That's so funny. Peter power picked up a puppy pubic areas. Come on in
*  So I'm like, oh, this is something she's never heard of now meeting more
*  So I go in there and it's a little waiting room and I go up to the desk and I will Kyle Dunn again
*  Hopefully she'll see the chart and go okay sit down. I got you and she goes
*  What are you here to see the doctor for again? And I'm like and I go I have a puffy
*  I have a puffy pubic area and she goes, oh you talked to her. Yeah talking like they were
*  Laughing and talking about it. Oh, you talked to her. We know that story
*  Yeah, we were laughing all morning about that story puffy pubic area and everybody is hot which minnow
*  Where's and this nurse came out and she's like Kyle Dunn again
*  And then she's walking me down the hallway and she goes what are you here to see the doctor for now?
*  Does anybody fucking communicate this sounds like a great porno all the girls are hot
*  You got a puffy pubic area and she just tell him to see how's you this is gonna sound crazy
*  But it's because to get the last time you came
*  I'm trying to not come I mean, yeah challenge for 30 days. I want to respect my god. That's what it is
*  Your come is backed up. Yeah, so let's get Diane in here starts to work its way into your lower gut
*  Michelle's got to work your balls. Get out of there. You have like a leaky cum container like your your dispenser
*  It's like it's just you got too much in there
*  Well, it's overflowing. That is a great porno and I don't want to I don't want to dismiss that as a great porno
*  So the end of this story
*  The doctor comes in and I'm in that paper roll
*  He opens up looks down looks up to me and he goes oh you just got a little fat
*  He left the room like I got a little fat. I'd even notice that's all it is
*  And I just wasted my day and humiliated myself. That's all it is puffy pubic area
*  You were worried you were gonna die. Yeah, well the reaction
*  Well, that was the thing about Robert Johnson to right they said they think oh
*  I think he had syphilis. Yeah, somebody murdered that guy
*  What are the symptoms of I like to be a hyper
*  Get into this one. We've discussed this one too many times on the part. All right, sorry
*  Okay, I'm gonna do it. Anyway, do you know what the term big wig?
*  You know, I like it sounds good. You know what comes from because people they lost their hair had to wear wigs from syphilis
*  And it came from these two French dudes. I think what are the cousins or some shit? I forget a Jean-Pierre
*  That's an accent you can still do but they were yeah, you can do that, you know
*  No one
*  You can do Italian too
*  Nobody I don't think you'll ever not be able to pick on a time. So what is it?
*  Louie these
*  14th and his cousin so they they had syphilis the fucking hairs falling out giant clumps or teeth are falling out of their head
*  like when people had syphilis, they just rotted apart and
*  That when their hair was falling out
*  They just got a crazy wig and the more money you had the bigger the wig you can get
*  So the real big wigs so all these other people got syphilis too and then wigs became like a thing of fashion
*  Anyway, I bet back then people just fucked everybody. Everybody just fucked everybody just ran do well
*  No, I feel it was rampant right? There's all these stories of like
*  Hundreds and hundreds of years ago where pedophilia and man boy love like it was normal. Yeah
*  Guys had like little boyfriends like famous
*  Philosophers had like a little boy
*  Yeah, like just imagine that shift in culture, you know, that was a good thing to get rid of I think for sure
*  But the Catholic Church disagrees. Yeah
*  That's a whole
*  Tax on the powder they used on the hair to like cover up the smell is what stopped it
*  Took the felt like the fat of the tax on the powder. So the powder became too expensive the smelly powder
*  Everybody smelled like perfume me stinky pussy
*  I guess hair was like a foot and they said perfume all over the foot a stinky rotten fucking marathoners foot you've
*  You're better off being a
*  Very poor person
*  But I would rather be someone who just got a studio apartment who makes
*  40 grand whatever like then be a king back then you would be a king if you imagine if you could just tell these people
*  If you're like you were in like ancient Europe and you're like, I'm gonna show you how I live
*  Oh, you got in the shower. He turned it on like oh my god. Now I'm gonna watch TV
*  Oh look, they're pumping his fucking wig with powder guys really leaning into it
*  So these dudes would all like lose not just their hair
*  But their teeth would fall they would get holes in their face and there's all these pictures. Oh, there's Lindsay fitteris
*  Yeah, we can show our own clip see that image of that dude's head that guy's head was falling apart like that because of syphilis
*  He was literally his skin was rotting apart. Oh, that's how a poll apparently that's how al Capone died as well. Oh really?
*  Yep, but then wigs became fashionable right cuz yeah everyone in a wig wigs became fashionable
*  Goddamnit that lady lost her nose. That's so crazy looking
*  That is so crazy looking
*  Just a big hole where your nose used to be but people have like holes in their cheeks and shit
*  Yeah, and then they would die. It's terrible man. I wish I
*  Off Jamie shut it off
*  Yeah, I mean it would rot right through you. It's really spooky stuff
*  We got rid of anybody who doesn't yeah, anybody doesn't like vaccines like hey settle down
*  Yeah, man, I've had this gentleman dr. Peter Hotez he's a
*  Vaccine advocate he's a doctor is
*  expert in tropical diseases
*  he was on the podcast talking about kovat and stuff like that and you know he gets very angry and people spout mistruths about
*  Vaccines like you have to look at the good and the bad like you have to be like real honest about what happens with any
*  any kind of medication
*  But with vaccines like oh my god, we fixed so many fucking problems your kids don't have to worry about polio anymore
*  You don't have to worry about smallpox anymore smallpox killed everybody
*  There was so much shit that was just killing people until they figured out vaccines
*  It's just people who aren't aware of that history or they don't really they really sink in don't they're fucking they
*  They're rightfully distrustful of a corrupt government. That's why so they hear about vaccines like it's fucking Bill Gates trying to put a microchip in me
*  What is that idea about Bill Gates? I mean that to me I came to figure out
*  He's spent so much of his money something happened helping people something happened Bill Gates became a bad guy
*  He spent so much of his money not enough bill you fuck. I mean would you do that you got?
*  60 billion you give me 50 billion. I think it's good even if he gives his kids money. It's good
*  He's telling he's not telling them that he's giving them to the moment. I had 50 billion
*  I'm gonna live like I'm in a jay-z video. I'm just gonna get a giant yacht, and I'm gonna have gold underwear
*  I'm gonna have a bottle of Dom in each hand like that song big pimpin
*  You're waiting for 50 billion. Yeah, that's the number
*  You're good no because you have to have goods land you have to have a lot of things planned out these these fucking crooks out
*  They're not playing is that the number 50 billion when you can relax
*  I don't know what a number is when you relax, but at that number. I'd say yes, I
*  Think but even then those fucking dudes always feel like they need more. That's it there you are
*  When all those other dudes there you are got yachts Jay-z got a fucking cruise ship I
*  Forgot that there was someone walking around with the dog come on man. This is what I'm talking about that would be me
*  To
*  Just dancing all day, but here's the thing man the real thing this is appealing because you can't have it and
*  The only time that feels good is when you do other shit. That's hard if you're just doing that every day
*  I swear to God you won't be happy. Yeah, it sounds fucked up, but you got to trust me human beings need puzzles
*  We need to solve things we need games to win we need things to do we need books to write
*  We need things to accomplish we need goals that we set we got to achieve them
*  If you don't do that you're not going to be happy and it's a big problem with people today
*  And if every day was like big pimping you would get bored big pimping for the weekends when you bust your ass
*  Monday through Friday, and you fucking put the pedal to the metal by it and then you know
*  I mean you you look rich kids that are disasters is it's really not terrible
*  I even I think you'd be really sad just given a huge house
*  You should be sitting in this big house by yourself. Yeah, you don't want a huge house man
*  Not if you're
*  One dude in particular if you're Batman you live in in one giant castle by yourself
*  That's your Batman come on man. You can't be you're so moving out Rob under why you're so moving
*  Yeah, yeah, but I didn't think he hangs out with Robin. I think you know Robin are cool
*  He's like I might have to keep rescuing this fucking guy. Oh, yeah, he does have to sort of care
*  Oh, we're gonna save him never pulls his own fucking weight this Robin. You're the Batman movie with the
*  With Alicia Silverstone that was maybe the worst movie ever
*  Batman Robin was called I auditioned for that movie. Oh, that's the gentleman who's on that LL Cool J cop show I
*  Don't know that right
*  Schwarzenegger was in it
*  Yeah, but I will freeze you a guy right right right, but that guy was
*  Robin oh he was Robin
*  Oh
*  Donald and he's on that cop show with LL Cool J oh
*  I missed that one to this day going back to Cali is in my fucking playlist hey when I'm working out
*  I like that song bikini small heels tall she said she likes the ocean
*  It's a great workout song I put on rocky music
*  Oh
*  Too much trumpet for me. It's a lot of trumpets to too needy. I get really pumped up when I hear a trumpet though
*  Yeah, well if you were running and rocky came on yeah, I would see it though
*  But like in regular in the regular world you don't want to listen to it. We're talking about it forgot like I
*  Like I think we're talking about something and then we got under our workout music, and I'm fucking ready to get into something important
*  Yeah
*  I am so glad to do this podcast with you. I've been having all these
*  Yesterday was my friend Brett Weinstein
*  He's a an evolutionary biologist and one of smartest fucking people ever met so it goes from him to this goofy
*  That's what I feel like bad people listening here so many smart people and
*  Yeah, but they want funny people to not that I'm an idiot, but I'm
*  and
*  And also we've been smoking which is I don't approve of this people like fun
*  Yeah, we have fun. We're Americans. God damn it. God damn it. That's right, and I bought a surfboard that came today
*  And I'm going to surf it you're going surf and I surf no you should get a lesson don't die
*  No, you can't I really want you to survive. You can't
*  You definitely can die you've never surfed you're right you're right, but I do know people who have told me they almost died surfing
*  How did they die sir almost got hit with the fucking wave and brought under and they didn't think they were going to get back
*  up dude
*  Come on man. Wow you think I can get a knockout from a surfboard
*  You know the scariest thing I ever heard anybody talk about with the ocean was not just that this guy died
*  In San Diego when they were all training for like a triathlon, and he got bitten half by a shark
*  In front of everybody so they're all in full on half full on great white just takes him and fucking rips him in half
*  In front of everybody and you're awake, and you're in the water
*  And you are hundreds of yards from the shore and the guy next to you just exploded with a sea monster
*  Just jumped out and ripped him in half and you know blood fuels shark frenzies
*  Yeah, and you go real slow you can't really even swim fast at your fastest
*  You're fucked you're trying to maintain a certain pace because you don't want to run out of gas
*  Yeah, right you don't be your slack you want to splash around either
*  Well
*  My friend Peter at Tia he swam those waters shortly afterwards because he's preparing for some crazy Hawaiian swim
*  Yeah, we swam from like Maui to the big island. What was it was the distance he swam something really insane
*  He swam from Maui to the big island
*  And I think he might have swam to lanai as well like all you try to do it all in one day
*  So he's in these shark infested waters tiger sharks all around
*  Hawaii and they're real aggressive. He's that's where he's gonna go swim after he's training for swimming
*  Right where the guy got bitten half by a shark like a week ago, but why would he do that?
*  Can you know man, I don't know people are different
*  Anyway people are different she comes surfing when they did I'm scared
*  Are you scared of sharks? 100% Yeah, cuz you are potential prey when you get in the water. Yeah, I'm a pussy
*  I'm not I'm not into getting eaten by a shark. I just don't think you have
*  many options for survival if one tries to get you and I know
*  Speed I know you're fast. I'm very quick. I search underwater
*  I think a seal is gonna sell you out push you towards the shark
*  That's what I'm worried about. I surf with a seal just
*  See you first yeah, it'll be like oh he loves seals like this is Kyle
*  This is his buddy the seal really the seals just there's a fucking shark boom
*  Yeah, and they catch you TMZ catches you kicking the seal into the water TMZ the shark snatches it up
*  Did the TMZ get you did they get me? You know paparazzi and
*  I've talked to the teams most of TMZ guys a lot of more comics
*  So you'd run into him at the airport and they were usually pretty cool. Yeah, good guys. They're just doing a job
*  You know it's just a weird look it's weird to not be famous and to see famous people and go what can I film?
*  It's right. Yeah, they have a great life. It's right there. I want to film them if it seems like
*  But the TMZ people in all honestly they they've always been pretty respectful if you tell them you know I'm too exhausted
*  I can't answer this complicated question after I just flew all night. You know
*  Yeah, cuz that's what a lot of it is right if you fucking coming out of an airport and you're high on edibles
*  Which I usually am of course that's how I'm flying and I have a Starbucks in my hand
*  I'm listening to Jimi Hendrix and some dude asked me. You know, what do you think about black lives matters?
*  I'm like, whoa, there's a loaded question right here
*  Yeah, you know or anything any any important issue where you could be like, you know, what do you think about it?
*  Biden or Trump? What do you know? What kind of answer am I gonna give you? Hi as fuck. Hold on to a Starbucks
*  It is the worst time to be the worst time especially if you don't
*  When you're flying you got to just accept the fact you're flying
*  You just sit there and you just sit there you listen to music or you look at a movie on your laptop
*  You're basically just sitting there chilling. You're like you accept where you are and then you get off
*  You get your coffee start walking and there's a question about life like I'm not thinking about life. I'm just chilling
*  I'm trying to not think like this is my not think time. This is not like I'm gonna do a podcast
*  Let me wake up and get ready to do a pot or I'm about to stand up
*  Let me wrap my brain up. No, this is like getting off of a plane. I mean the worst the answers ever
*  I don't know what the fuck I'm saying and I think people go to you a little bit. She
*  Cuz your podcast they go to you for answers like the last, you know Kendall Jenner something different than they're gonna ask you
*  I'm not a guy that for answers. Trust me
*  I'm a guy that can point you to people that might have answers, but I'm not the answer
*  You know, you got a wide range of knowledge though. Yeah, but it doesn't glue together, right? It's scattered
*  It's basically inoperable
*  It's great for bringing things up on a podcast. It's not great for like real-world applications
*  Yeah, you know, I just have weird facts that like about the Comanche's stored in my head
*  I know science things such as does completely useless, but it's not that's the whole reason why we're here
*  I don't know why people are as fascinated with science as I should be it is
*  It's amazing that we make actual discoveries that I think are even more magical than
*  Religion some of the religion stories and people don't
*  almost like scientists are
*  Elite nerds or something. They're not cool to people and I think without science
*  You would just be in the woods pooping in a hole and you'd die in a week
*  Well, I think we've got two things going on simultaneously. We have the biological needs
*  Okay, and biological needs mean that like men are still in some way rewarded for
*  Being like big strong
*  Physical specimens like a big football player or you know some elite athlete
*  It's like biologically a woman's body will tell her like that is a man to breed with I'm going to make strong offspring
*  There's no if-ands-or-butts about it. It is what it is. I know you're right. Yeah. Yeah, so because of that
*  These guys have the resources and the bandwidth to create all the things they create
*  Dumb guys who get a lot of pussy ain't inventing shit. Yeah anytime. I'll tell you thinking that way
*  There's an app that that makes me handsome and I'll be zooming, you know, we really corny stuff with like Kurt
*  Yeah, and I'll tell you I relax
*  Me and just cuz my jaw is slightly bigger, you know, and I just I get a whole new personality
*  I realized I developed this like meh personality cuz the face I just was given
*  But on the other hand one of the reasons why you're so funny is the perspective of life that you have coming from someone
*  Who's not totally happy with your appearance? No, I was just a very
*  Tiny and it did not go off me and my sister wanted a sister
*  So when I was born I was constantly dressed up in makeup as a girl and she'd call me Kailena and I had to live
*  There's like a like a girl with I was my whole life. I've had women just like
*  Like on me just telling me what to do and I ended up like
*  My I took tap and jazz with my mother. I didn't want to do that. Oh my god
*  Tab I went to get the tab shoes and the guy was like one day will see you on Broadway
*  I remember thinking like I don't want to I think my they kind of raised me to be a
*  Like a woman this sounds like the beginning of a biography of a serial killer. Yes
*  This is what it sounds like
*  Just tortured by your mom you really you wanted to play baseball go fishing
*  She's like I'm gonna raise a gay man if it's the last of me
*  I remember my parents found a like nude mag
*  They weren't even near the women in underwear under my bed
*  My dad was like like a little relieved not that he was ever would be against being gay, but he was like I
*  Thought you were gay
*  But he was didn't want me to have a life probably right. I mean look I'm built like
*  Not a tough man, I'm not built like I'm proud to be one of your softest friends
*  But didn't you tell me you're doing a prison workout? Yeah now I'm gonna be huge by the end of COVID
*  I'll be here. What are you doing?
*  Together and shit. I got bricks wrapped them in duct tape gorilla duct tape really and you lift and weights with bricks
*  Yeah, I'm getting I'll be huge by the end of this you really could do that. It's actually
*  It's getting all the muscles, you know, I read a story once so there's a guy was talking about how to become a power lifter
*  He was explaining to people what what to do to become a power lifter and one of the pieces of advice
*  He was giving is get a manual labor job
*  Yeah, I'm just literally saying like you want to get really strong
*  You want to lift at night after work, but you want to work all day like picking up bricks and shit
*  Yeah, it's like this guy was like his strategy for being a stronger power lifter was get a job carrying rocks all day
*  Yeah, I dug I bought all these ficus plants for my front yard like 13 of them and they're like you want us to help
*  You dig a home like I got it. I
*  Swear the dirt was so hard. It took me about three hours per hole and I just did it cuz I was like
*  This is great exercise great exercise and holy crap. My doctor. Dr. Mark Gordon. He does it
*  He's been on this podcast before he actually does that for exercise. He'll go out in his backyard
*  Just dig a hole. Yeah digging a hole gets pretty much everything and I go what are you doing with the hole?
*  He goes nothing fill it in just digging a hole doing it for exercise. I wasn't saying no
*  He's got a project though. No, he's a bright man
*  he realizes that first of all when you think about digging a hole like honestly as someone I mean, I'm not a
*  The kinesiologist, but I understand a little bit about exercise
*  When you're it's a smart word for a guy who knows exercise
*  When you hold on to a pole and you fucking shove it into the ground with your leg and then you yeah
*  That's what I did. That's a workout man. Yeah, that's a real work
*  And it's a workout that works everything it works your whole body as long as you keep switching legs and switch the way you pull
*  The thing you're gonna use both sides your back
*  You don't do this way you hit yourself in the face
*  you do this shit and this shit and depending upon obviously the size of the handle of the the
*  Shovel but you can get a real workout shoveling man. Just fucking shoveling things to the ground stomp it on it
*  They're gonna hole is and then chucking it. I mean, it's all shoulders and neck and back
*  I want this guy to feel some satisfaction like I put in some ficus trees. I got some nice curb appeal
*  Yeah, he's out there digging holes and I don't I understand
*  Maybe you come to someone's maybe you do charity work where people need holes. You know, I mean, yeah, I'll tell us go to do it
*  But well, it's his yard man. He wants to have a nice green lawn so you could stare at it
*  Go look at your nature. Look what I got
*  You will bend to the wheel of my visual pleasure
*  I'll say what I did. I got some some quotes on turf fake grass. Oh, that's so how you care about that
*  They look good house ones that had that the whole side yard was all turt is a beautiful house
*  But it was it the good turf. Oh, is it really good turf?
*  You can tell though. Well, you only can tell cuz they told you I mean once you got on it
*  You could tell but it's still beautiful
*  But I don't like it because I want I mean
*  I'd rather have like a bunch of patches of dirt and some grass and I want the fucking earth there
*  I don't want a plastic toupee that pretends to be okay
*  I could see that get the fuck out of here plastic toupee that pretends to be plants
*  I want grass if you saw my own my lawn is all we use your lawn bro. Dude. Don't talk about my long like that
*  Yeah, there's a I mean would you want to do your lawn in the fake grass
*  I am I'm getting a quote if it's a good price
*  I'm gonna do it because I tried it to grass and it's been a nightmare
*  I can't get these weeds to get out of my face. Don't be a pussy. What one dude in my
*  Dude in my neighborhood is fake grass. I swear to God when I take my dog. It's a nice fellow
*  I'm sure no harm against him. Just got a house of fake grass in the front
*  My dog pisses on it every time he's like, what is this?
*  He steps in it and like you'd see looks down his feet
*  This isn't even grass he pisses on every time he walks by it
*  Actually, how do I get the dog crap out of it?
*  No, you can't get the dog crap it stays forever and then it becomes a new thing
*  New bacteria leaps hosts
*  I'll be patient zero for the next cove of cove at 20
*  I mean, I'm sure they make it where you can't tell but you it's not nothing's growing through that man
*  You're covering over the picture of my law my lawn and I think you'd feel different. No, it's a disaster
*  I don't give a fuck
*  You care about my lawn
*  Put some time into it or don't I don't cover it with some plastic. I put so much time
*  I'm just I just want it to be I may put just I don't know what to do. Who cares
*  Listen, isn't it strange though?
*  They're like like a garden is so much more pleasant than just plants that you see on your own like a garden
*  It's like I put this into the ground gave it life. Look at my tomato plants
*  Yeah, that's cool. Have you ever had a salad from your own yard?
*  No, it's weirdly satisfying man
*  Weird is weirdly satisfying. I've had an orange from a tree. That's great, too
*  Yeah an orange from your own tree. That's awesome
*  Yeah, it's been my neighbors
*  But it's something about like like if you can grow the lettuce grow the tomatoes grow some bell peppers and some onions grow all that stuff
*  Mix together a little balsamic vinaigrette grow the carrots chop them up put them in the salad and you're eating that salad
*  Holy shit, I grew this thing. This is crazy. Do you know that I think baby carrots were baby carrots. What are they?
*  They're carrots. They just made small. They're just really little they pull no
*  They just got actual carrots and they shaved them small. Oh
*  There's no baby cats. I might be wrong
*  Maybe trolled that's saying people are assholes. They're telling you it's a baby carrot. It's an old grandpa carrot
*  I'm wondering they shaved down grandpa carrot. Oh, man. I got it. I got it. It's hard for me to put on weight
*  I go all gut this way my whole family's these giant barrels and then twig legs like
*  And then they come
*  Waltzing up it looks disgusting. I'm constantly fighting it and I you know my neck
*  Here's a quick story. Okay, I woke up one day. Here's a dream. I was having I was turning
*  I'm turning the top of a coke can the top off. Okay wrench. Can't get it off six foot can
*  I wake up six foot can of coke bottle of coke. It's a dream. I'm having oh, okay, I wake
*  They're so expensive really bad for you a lot of calories
*  Sorry, so I wake up with my hands wrapped around my head. I was twisting my own head
*  So I go to the doctor feeling like an idiot
*  Oh my god, crazy, they x-rayed my my neck, you know
*  And they put on the wall and this doctor was rubbing his chin looking at my neck
*  But you don't want a doctor confused looking at your skeletal
*  Yeah, I'm super confident right and everything looks normal right and he goes Jonathan calls another guy in and now they're both just
*  Like looking at my neck and I'm thinking I'm dying
*  I was if you were a doctor and some guy comes in and he's a patient and
*  You say well, I just gotta give you a little x-ray and check to see what's going on and there you x-ray him
*  And he's got all these weird bones he's not supposed to have
*  Yeah
*  His entire spinal structure is totally different. Everything's different the whole thing's different and the doctor looks at and goes what what's going on here?
*  And he goes shut the fuck up
*  This is another good porn because he's from another planet. Yeah, it's infiltrating and then the nurses come in and blow them
*  Yeah, they all suck his dick
*  This piece in the galaxy again. I love it
*  So he looks at and the lumberjack women showed up. Oh, yeah
*  The lumberjills this has just been a podcast of great porn some of the scribbling some porn writers doing a lot of scribble
*  I hope so. It was funny. I
*  Texted Tom
*  Segura did I text him or did I put it online? I think I might have tweeted it. Has anybody made kovat porn yet?
*  Tom Segura immediately
*  Immediately text me a photo of this lady with the fucking kovat mask on and some guys grabbing her ass
*  I'm like, this is crazy. So then he sends me a link
*  It is a kovat porn like two days after lockdown
*  How many views I'm just curious was it billions of views now billions everyone's jerked off to it
*  Yeah, yes to get on that imagine. That's the that's the that's the thrill. Yeah
*  Mike get a fire fucking during a pandemic
*  It is kind of hot women like covering up anything
*  Covered up even they cover their ankles. We're like man. I see those ankles right? It's like it was risky to show your ankles
*  Yeah, they're covering their mouths. Yeah, they have a lot of power
*  But again, it's the change of culture like we were talking about just imagine
*  Living in a time just a few hundred years ago where women had to cover their ankles
*  Like you had you you had you have a blouse that goes all the way down the floor crazy
*  But people were so
*  Animalistic I bet men were so out of control and disgusting that you kind of had to obscure the shape of your body
*  Or they would just try to rape you. Oh, man. I bet hundreds of years ago like most guys raped. That's what I think
*  Yeah, I bet if you go back like 4,000 years ago, I get but I think rape is like insanely common. Yeah, insanely common. Yeah
*  like we're gonna talk about Genghis Khan and his
*  DNA is in like something like five
*  Asian people the the perv men rape DNA gets spread
*  Yeah
*  Exactly is in all all of us
*  But the balance is the scientists don't get pussy so they don't get distracted and so they figure things out
*  They're those big gigantic football player dudes. They're just fucking
*  storm
*  Style just like brah like a fucking sandstorm just throwing dick all over the place those guys don't invent anything. No, it's like you almost
*  Need to have no distractions and the best way to have no distractions is no one wants to fuck you
*  We'll be right back. I mean nobody wants to say this right?
*  But when you think of like weird sort of anti-social behavior people people getting locked into an online world
*  People getting disconnected from human beings, you know all all of this is that's not a good trend
*  that's
*  Happening more than ever and then with kovat it gets ramped up even more because you have to do it that way. Yeah, I
*  Feel like I went a full circle on the being stuck alone and now I I was lonely for a little while and I'm I'm fine
*  I don't know if maybe I'm turning into a psychopath, but you're about there. You're right right about that the door
*  Psychopathic. Yeah surfing that's in great. It's an insane thing. I'm zooming
*  Surfing looks like it's so fun. It's so even being terrible at it is so fun. You just wipe out. It's so fun
*  Oh, I didn't finish my next story. Oh, you're high. Yeah, we're super high. We're sorry folks
*  Sorry folks. We did I went off on an alien autopsy
*  Sorry, it's not a great story. It's just I'm if I'm someone's listening I feel like what happened to your neck, right?
*  The guy doctor turns me he goes because I was like what what is it my dying and he goes
*  You have the neck of a seven-foot man
*  That's the end of that story so you have a very long neck yeah
*  Why I brought this up. I'll never know and they go talking about my weird body
*  Don't now you're looking at my neck. It's normal. I'm hunching. I got a hunch it. Yeah, you guys like a wrestler
*  I'm like a pro. I want to come back cuz a handsome app also makes my shoulders big and stuff
*  It's cool. Crisper was just used to successfully treat some disease
*  No, what I bought crisper. I don't have many stocks, but I did crisper and Tesla. Oh good moves. What was it Jim?
*  Stock bro
*  Yeah, that's a lot of money
*  But um here it is with inherited diseases successfully treated with crisper so this is
*  What the real
*  Fascinating thing about crisper is is that they're going to be able to cure a bunch of diseases through it and here it is
*  two people with
*  Bay boys say that word beta
*  so
*  Thalassemia and one with sickle cell disease no longer require blood transfusions
*  Which are normally used to retreat to treat severe forms of these inherited diseases
*  After their bone marrow stem cells were gene edited with crisper so they do they
*  Fucking edited their bone marrow stem cells. That's where we're going
*  Holy shit the preliminary results demonstrate in essence a functional cure for patients with beta
*  Thalassemia and sickle cell anemia a
*  Functional cure so they figured out a fucking cure for sickle cell man
*  Yeah, I think this is where
*  I think you're gonna go to your doctor with your genes yes
*  I think what we're looking at now is the tip of the you know tip of the iceberg the the beginning steps of
*  This kind of technology they're gonna be able to edit people they're gonna be able to make you the rock
*  You're gonna look like the rock and they shrink my neck
*  They're gonna shrink your no they're gonna give you a body to match your neck the rock seven feet tall yeah
*  Yeah, you have to be the rock I
*  Saw the rocky years ago. He's at my gym at Gold's we're going like 2001 like early young rock before he's
*  I got a stack of hamburgers like 12 hamburgers you say he's enormous
*  You don't realize how enormous it is until you see him in real life like Oh Kermany. Yeah
*  But in the future like that's an anomaly to be that big like as big as he is and handsome and so
*  Charismatic but all those things are an anomaly for them all to be together
*  But what if you could just edit someone's genes and turn them into a specimen like the rock be real weird man
*  Oh, you think they could edit. Yeah, I think so come out
*  I think they're gonna be able to edit how you are look at that Jesus son
*  Got a fucking flag in the background
*  Build a brick shithouse
*  Determined covered with real sweat that he earned you've found American you pansy-ass fucks. That's the greatest American that's ever lived I
*  Mean I think it might be tough to edit your jawline or so no just inject you with some fucking
*  Super architectural oh the whole thing they have mapped out
*  Yeah, you want to look like map out your frame, and then you just shake like do you remember that movie with?
*  God damn it. I'm gonna remember what it is a Vietnam movie a real trippy movie with
*  The
*  Guy that was in Shawshank Redemption. What was his name? Oh?
*  Crap the white guy
*  Tim Robbins Tim Robbins okay, Tim Robbins was in a Vietnam movie
*  Where they gave the?
*  Jacob's Ladder that's right the
*  The idea was that the whole movie
*  I don't want spoiler alert was kind of like a LSD or some psychedelic induced dream that the government game a psychedelic and gave him
*  crazy induced fucked up dream
*  But you that's how you'd go so they would put you in
*  Some fucking cocoon and you'd shake this LSD people in Jacob's Ladder
*  And then boom you come out the rock
*  That's what's gonna happen. There's gonna be no exceptional people. There's gonna be no people that are any different everyone is gonna be perfect
*  But then it's gonna be like living in that jay-z video every day do do
*  Everyone's gonna get bored. I don't believe that's gonna happen. It's gonna happen. We're gonna fuck it up
*  We're gonna fuck it up like we fucked up the environment and the ocean and birth control here
*  We fucked up everything like we fucked up everything we've ever done
*  We're gonna fuck it up because we fuck up everything we fuck up everything and then we figure out what we fucked up
*  And then we try to unfuck it right well. I'll tell you this is what's next there. It is Jacob's Ladder
*  1990 and this we will for sure fuck up
*  Because with the Tesla car and they're solving vision now
*  They're gonna be able to put this in robots
*  They'll be able to walk around your house and like cook make your sandwich and when you get a
*  robot girlfriend or boyfriend
*  That can make you lab is has all this information does do all this she's nice
*  What what is gonna? And then when you want to be alone she goes into the closet and turns off
*  What is this gonna do with relationships well it depends if you're a bitch or not
*  It's basically the same thing as the other things we're talking about you're good
*  You can't live in a jay-z movie forever
*  You can't have the fucking hot maid that just sucks your dick anytime you want
*  Oh, you have a relationship with an actual human being well now wait a minute
*  I'm talking about fun than the robot fuck doll lady
*  But Joe you can program robot fuck lady to be kind of a bitch sometime like you can program it to the point
*  Wouldn't be real you wouldn't be her decision you want a human
*  It's just you're always gonna be annoyed with something that's not a human. It's gonna be too easy
*  It's like playing a game of quake with god mode on where you can't be killed and just running over everything you get bored
*  Part of the fun is you can get shot in the head, but it's like a chess game chess app you go to the higher level
*  No, it's not real though
*  You know it's not real until you don't and then when you don't it becomes effective again, but while you know
*  It's not real you're never gonna accept it well you know this robot lady will just suck your dick like suck my dick robot lady
*  You can't even get hard, but you know you asshole suck your own cock
*  It's a little spicy with you don't want that man. It seems like you want that because you can't have
*  You know what that is what you're talking you can't have a beautiful woman
*  Who's like wearing lingerie who just does whatever you want and it's like but you're you're still person
*  You want you can program her to be exactly like your last pain for her to just be a regular person
*  This is bullshit change. I just get a regular person. You could be from the South one week blonde hair look
*  You're in a good relationship, but imagine guys who can't get laid that is where I think we need to remove part of their brain
*  So they believe that robots real
*  I'm not against that actually and the robots programmed to make them a better person
*  Program robot is programmed to be almost like a great woman in your life is inspires you to be a better version
*  What's gonna happen yes, we could do that, but they have to be war on
*  They have to be morons or the robots have to be way better than they are right now
*  They have to be like the the simulation has to be better than actual reality so that you initially submit to it
*  I disagree yes, it's a public in tax plan
*  They talk you into like listen all you have to do eventually this is gonna work out in your benefit
*  But right now you got to submit to leaving all of your consciousness in this alternative
*  Recreated dimension don't worry your physical body will be safe and fine. We just we're gonna offer you a five-minute trial
*  But here's the pros you never have to worry about your bills again
*  Everything is paid for and you live like a rock star for the rest of your life
*  And you stay alive the same amount of time, so what are you doing?
*  Do you really want to just fucking struggle and get beat up by the cops and and fucking lose your job because of?
*  Corporate and there's they're downsizing. They don't give a fuck how much money you put in this fucking company
*  Would you like would you want to do it the hard way or would you want to stay alive the same amount of time?
*  but we just connect you to a machine and the
*  Memories and life that we give you is far more exciting. It's amazing. You're a superhero. You're the king of the world
*  You're on top of everything you live like your
*  Dr.. Manhattan, but it's not binary like that you can have a something a little in between maybe not
*  Maybe once they hit the switch they say listen just try it just try and then you can give you a free weekend
*  They give you a free weekend. They 100% and they just get everybody we can and everybody gets it everybody
*  You get the first it free. I thought Mike work like working at the sawmill. He doesn't anymore. He wants to be dr
*  Manhattan he wants to be one of the watchmen. He wants to he wants to be on Mars just jerking off
*  That's what he wants to do
*  What how popular that one would be oh yeah, I picked the Mars jerk-off package. Do you think we're in a simulation?
*  Are you swimming by the way too stupid to know but smart people do
*  Elon does again and go back to Elon. He thinks we're in a simulation. Okay, so he's smarter than both or easy
*  He's I should say this way. I don't want to put words in his mouth
*  I think he's very open to entertaining the idea that we're in a simulation and that it's very possible that we're in a simulation
*  Yes, but I think it's a factor of what actual life is that's what I think what do you mean?
*  I think what what we're thinking of us being in a simulation
*  Oh, I think maybe we need to look at it even bigger like maybe that's a factor of
*  What life is that life always has this weird?
*  fucked up
*  Theatrical quality it always feels fake and it's influenced a certain amount by the way
*  We think not just it's not just a physical thing just like when people are mad at you
*  It feels terrible like if you said something at work to a guy and you regret it
*  You got to go there the next day and see him you got to run into him
*  We feel bad feel bad like people feel bad when they have bad interactions with each other
*  We're not just like we're not just
*  We're definitely not
*  Individuals that are disconnected from everyone around them if people around you have bad feelings you feel bad
*  There's no getting around that so there's some shit going on with people
*  it's way deeper than just
*  Just like words and looking at each other. There's like energy that's being transferred back and forth between people
*  It just hasn't been defined yet
*  well
*  I'm definitely a little high. It was really hard for me to follow but also
*  They found recently we are pixels. You know that the smallest the plank length
*  I think it's called work a triangle so you literally could
*  Make this you actually you don't touch anything. You know that too. You know you never actually touch anything atoms don't touch right?
*  I mean, that's another
*  There's some things that are
*  Disturbing but if someone touches you they touch you well you're by that you could say no one ever rapes anybody
*  It's just like no one ever touches
*  Well, I guess you can define the word touch you never actually never beats anybody up. You can't touch each other
*  No assault is real
*  Well now no car accidents are real because no one ever touches anybody. I'm still funny. You don't care about my lawn, but listen
*  I do it. They're gonna make plastic the point is they're gonna make robots
*  Robot girlfriends, and I don't know who which sex is a good question for you to answer
*  Which sex will be more mad like the females got these guys who have these sex these robots that are
*  They're not dating anymore because they love this and or women or will men be mad because women are totally satisfied this guy
*  That's like what happened at work what?
*  All the what if all the robots that the women chose were seven foot Jamaican dudes with dreadlocks
*  That's what they wanted, you know that was like the most popular robot fuck dolls for ladies. They're called opposite Kyle's
*  Just giant super athlete big dong fellas with dreadlocks probably yeah those would sell
*  Well, I mean why guys would be so mad everybody would be mad. I
*  Mean a lot of dudes would be upset you think about how many old people are sad and lonely
*  They're their wife died their husband died and then you can give them this Viking dick
*  It's like dude just huge
*  With scars on his face. Yeah cop his shoulders have dried blood splattered on him
*  And he listens will of fucks your grandmother he listens good to her too
*  It's so hard looking at her too, and he wants to know about her stories
*  Oh, he gets so hard when she crochets he gets hard as a rock. Yeah, it's just
*  Can you imagine you got your grandmother a fucking Viking robot doll?
*  What a gift he shows up with like wolf skins around his shoulders and shit your grandma here
*  Yes
*  Yes, Thor. She's right this way
*  Just dragging a fucking axe with him as he walks in the house
*  I don't I think we're 20 years away from this and not I don't think that's ridiculous
*  It's not ridiculous because here's the thing man if you think about what what makes someone attracted to someone right if you say
*  Okay, well a guy would be attracted to a woman who has a great personality, and she's fun to be around
*  She's got a pretty face and a nice body
*  But that's some evolutionary code the same reason why a woman is attracted to a big giant strong man like that's good genes
*  Like there's some evolutionary code. What if they got in there with the crisper and just fucking monkey britch that shit and you only
*  sexually attracted to dying people
*  Like that's it like they could send you to like a cancer ward and you just go on a fuckfest
*  yeah, cuz that's your thing and
*  Syphilis run these dudes that live in this cancer ward. They're like dying
*  You know what if some hot robot lady that they program?
*  Or that some person these programs
*  Tracted to that that person thing though you'd ruin that person's life, but a robot. Yeah robot
*  You'd be yeah, but what if but what if the robot's so good?
*  It's really indistinguishable from a person then when does the robot have rights?
*  We got to get on this robot. It's very good. Look man
*  We can't make that mistake
*  You know as human beings we've already decided that other humans that aren't like us are
*  Are not equal to us. Yeah, what if we eventually invent a fucking robot that has all the characteristics of us including it feels pain
*  And we decide that it's not oh my god
*  Have we not learned from all of the years of horrors that we've inflicted upon our fellow man
*  We're gonna now do this to these sentient robots. So we got to try to make them
*  We're not gonna stop. I always go to the scene in Ex Machina when that lady just leaves
*  When she hopped in that helicopter, she just leaves with any school. We open the door, you know, she's gonna suffocate in there
*  Yeah, he's pounded on that big thick plexiglass
*  You know, he's never getting out and she just no emotion walks towards the helicopter
*  What if this is a simulation and our this has happened over and over our job is to create the machines that then
*  Like our purpose we find out is to create the machines
*  That makes a lot of sense and this just happens over and over these these little
*  Beings a kid little smart and then they make us again and then we make another universe
*  I had a joke that I did a long time ago about the Big Bang Theory
*  That like
*  What if the Big Bang Theory is just like what people figure out like they get to a point where someone and it takes like
*  14 billion years they get to the point where something can invent a button you press that button it resets time and
*  Then they're all sitting around staring at it and one dude with like auto
*  He's got like autism and he's on Red Bull
*  Yeah, and no one's ever touched his dick and he's like fucking I'll press it boom, right? He presses that button and bang
*  The whole universe explode and then contracts and then starts all over again. Yeah, and it's a big bang and every
*  14 plus billion years
*  We figure out how to make a big bang. Yeah, I mean maybe we've
*  If you think about what we're doing and what we used to be able to do think about when I was talking about the
*  Comanche's and that pistol there was a big deal in 1840 that someone figured out how to make a revolver
*  That ain't shit now, yeah, you keep going like way way way way way way way into the future
*  Why is a big bang button preposterous? I don't think it is
*  No, and it make we're clearly missing so much information like the Big Bang
*  Right. Well, I do way more information did it used to be how small
*  Right the whole universe was smaller than the head of a pin in the gut and I got sorry
*  Aren't right a lot but it just doesn't seem it seems like there's a huge piece
*  Well, I put that story right up there with Elisha and the two bears. Oh, yeah same story
*  Yeah, who the fuck knows what happened? But we know Elisha and the she bears
*  Boys, we got some we got some data at least the she bears got zero
*  You know, we have yeah, we have this sound it's coming from 14 billion years ago
*  Whatever it is 13.9 billion years ago. The weird thing is we're missing gravity is weird
*  Where does that go? Well, not just that like what about dark matter like explain that to me dark matter and dark energy
*  Explain it. They don't really know they know what it does. They know the impact it has
*  Yeah, that's why they call it dark matter cuz they're dark on it
*  Well had fun interviewing my dad on tonight's episode of triggered
*  We covered many topics, but there was only one thing I really wanted to know our aliens real
*  Only thing I really want to know
*  He's terrified of his dad
*  It's a teaser for it's coming out tonight
*  They got us they got us they got us aliens
*  No, these fucking these people who got us to tune into this event
*  Um, I do want to see they got us they cut it off right at the very key cages if it's so important
*  Tell us what what's with the suspense? He's supposed to be the president. This isn't about ratings. Are you an alien?
*  Do you think aliens are here? Yes
*  What are your what are you basing that on? Just my imagination and hopes and dreams. I
*  Say no way and I'll tell you why first of all the people understood how far away things other stars
*  You're so right if people understood the idea of sending a video from a phone to another phone in a matter of seconds
*  Do you know how crazy that is that sounds impossible? It can't be done. But first of all, what's a video?
*  But how is it made and how does it go through the air and land perfectly on Kyle's phone?
*  Air drop what the fuck is an airdrop all those things?
*  All right, I do not just disclaim what I'm saying. Don't
*  You wish you were smarter you just so
*  I just was a little bit
*  No, but discredit right the speed of light you you physically can't go faster because your mass would be infinite
*  So we got the our closest stars for light years away
*  It takes a second for light to go to the moon and it took us almost a week to get there going
*  18,000 miles an hour. Yeah going for four years
*  I just and also if you got to go that far aren't you gonna say hello and you're not just gonna be in the sky and
*  Just I don't know. Well you everything you said is very good. Very important
*  I don't think that all we know about propulsion and the ability to travel through space and time is the same
*  Right as a civilization that's been around for thousands of years longer than us
*  So if there is a civilization out there and I'm not saying there is but if scientists believe that there should be I mean
*  There was a recent thing they were talking about they're doing
*  Some sort of an equation about our own galaxy that said there might be as many as 36
*  Intelligent life forms in terms of planets occupied by intelligent life forms in in our galaxy
*  So they don't really know they're just kind of guessing
*  But you gotta assume that if it happened once in the right set of circumstances
*  It could happen again if given enough time and the planet doesn't get blown up now if what we know about people in
*  2020 I mean we have in like we're talking about sending videos through the air and fucking
*  Spacex is shooting people in the space again docking at the space station, and there's a lot of crazy shit
*  We're doing that didn't exist at all a hundred years ago
*  So if we went a thousand years from now how fucking bonkers would be the inventions
*  Well, you gotta assume that each invention exponentially encourages more inventions to branch off of it
*  But it doesn't always mean when you look at we started off with planes
*  You know the Wright brothers and then we very quickly get into propellers and jet engines
*  And then we were rocketing you know to the moon and like this and then so we were like oh in 85
*  We'll have flying cars because that was the trajectory and it just went well. They do have flying cars
*  They just don't use them and they're not very good, but they do exist
*  You can do it, but the ones that we were imagining would be in the yeah totally didn't and probably I mean that flattened off
*  But but there's also problems of everybody having a helicopter
*  You know helicopters were supposed to be the next form of transportation
*  When the helicopter is invented it was invented to people thought that was gonna replace the car
*  You're gonna be able to just fucking fly around
*  This fucking twat always lands a fucking helicopter when I'm trying to take it out
*  But that's I think it's it's still it doesn't mean we can't do it you could everybody could have a helicopter
*  It's just not practical people can't afford it
*  Can't land them every sky can't be full of helicopters the way the goddamn road is filled with cars
*  We'd be dying could be slamming into each other left and right like how would you make clear lanes and paths?
*  Maybe it could be done. Maybe it could be done in the future
*  Maybe it would be more you know efficient or more energy efficient or won't you know they'll be electric
*  So I won't fuck up the environment or something. I don't know yeah, but they can do it I
*  Mean on the alien thing a hundred percent and think there's life on other planets
*  Just they found every star that they've looked at you and they've got yes telescopes have planets around it
*  They didn't know that so recently so then you have to multiply how many more
*  chances there are of life and it's
*  Well, not only that he was are it wasn't the pictures they have of these planets are dogshit. They're nothing
*  They're nothing you can like you can see pictures of the moon and they're awesome pictures
*  But pictures of planets in other galaxies you get like a spec
*  You get like a spec or they just they recognized by the way the Sun wobble sometimes
*  You find yeah, they find what the star is and they recognize that there's like a certain kind of a wobble to the image
*  It's coming so they talk pretty cool. Yeah, pretty cool
*  So they figure out that a planet circle in it, but there's no like real good photos like we have photos of Venus
*  It's insane right like you see the like Saturn or Jupiter Jupiter's photos are amazing man
*  They're fucked pull up a photo of Jupiter
*  I have a telescope Saturn man. See that's a photo that we have
*  Just imagine if you are floating around near that thing and you could look at it and realize here's this lifeless
*  Massive object that shares point shares a solar system with us. I have a
*  Telescope on my lawn. I can see Saturn's really I can see Jupiter's moon. Oh, dude. You're one of those guys
*  It's eight hundred and forty five million miles Wow
*  But keep pull up a Jupiter photo I
*  Remember there was a an event that happened
*  I don't remember what year it was but a giant asteroid slammed in oh, yeah, and they realized like oh wait a minute
*  They they are way bigger than we thought like when that happens an asteroid slammed into
*  Jupiter and the explosion was larger than the size of the earth. Yeah
*  They have pictures of that. I
*  Think that's true. Yeah, they do might have made that up. No, you're right
*  Look at that man
*  Like that's the impact we need that big planet look how it changed the color of the stripe I heard that we're
*  We wouldn't be here without Jupiter because it scoops up a lot of the asteroids. Yeah, apparently it's so massive
*  Yeah, but it sucks things into it said each
*  SL 9 nucleus hurled material into space which left a large scar
*  When it fell onto Jupiter god, it's so amazing to think that there's these
*  Enormous man, you know like Miami sized rocks
*  Yes, like this pace and they could just slam into us and then everything's off
*  Everything's off the electricity the power the lights the Sun you can't breathe
*  You know if you're anywhere near the impact you're dead instantly anywhere near with hundreds of miles
*  Even in the atmosphere I hear you burn up just from the heat of it dude. You're so fucked
*  You're so triple double fucked that that volcano that you're talking about earlier. Mm-hmm
*  What's when's that supposed to blow up because that'll root that'll kill everybody right? It's a caldera
*  So a volcano it's a volcano that they didn't realize was a volcano until like they started using satellites
*  I believe they just thought that it was like seismically active hot springs. Yeah, beautiful
*  So pretty thank you. And and then one day is that the actual impact? Oh my god, you can see the impact
*  Look at that
*  Watch how it hits and it breaks back it up back it up. Watch this. Look at this. Here's how it hits
*  The gravity breaks it up. I think before it hits and so there's like a bunch of little pockmark boom boom boom boom
*  Look at that. So that explosion apparently was the size of the earth
*  Find out if that's true. I could maybe use aliens bro. Find out if that's true. Was that explosion the size of the earth? I
*  Know we shouldn't check any but we were saying just in case let's just not check
*  But I think it's it's somewhere in that range, but if that hit us man, that's a wrap
*  I think the red dots about our size the red storm and the thing is man
*  There's fucking holes all over this planet where it hit. Oh, yeah things hit here all the time
*  There's like no rhyme or reason to it either. It's not like they wouldn't hit us man. We're like really close to 5g nationwide
*  I
*  Don't give a fuck those rocks are flying out of nowhere
*  And by the way, if you really want to see an end to racism
*  It'll be when a giant rock is coming from the sky to kill us all that then you realize how stupid it was to care
*  That's what's gonna happen. Yeah, what were we all trying to feel different racism sexism any kind of discrimination?
*  Homophobia all of it's gonna seem so stupid when you see a rock flying on the sky. They're like my god have been so distracted
*  Yeah, I
*  Don't know if they can even knock those things out that was a
*  Little exaggeration that says one group of astronomers estimate the object to be 16 and a half to 65 feet across. Oh same size
*  Right, but the explosion didn't they say the explosion was some massive
*  What is it? What are they saying about the size of the explosion though?
*  Because that was the thing that they were stunned by they were stunned by the actual size of the impact area
*  Even though it is a gas giant. So I don't know how the fuck it even
*  You know what is what is happening? Yeah, what's it? What's happening when it has a hard core or the bottom?
*  Probably right. I don't even know how stupid am I it's a gas giant. It's just a gas giant
*  It's just you know, I would say that real cops all if I knew someone was gonna question me
*  I'd like well, you know Jupiter's a gas giant. Yeah. Oh, yeah
*  Very confident when my work can't be checked
*  Venus hottest planet in the solar system and it's not the closest and it's because of greenhouse gases
*  Pumping into our atmosphere. Wow
*  Yeah, we are you melt metal on the surface of the Venus. Yeah
*  Things are I do notice more fires. Mm-hmm. Well, the climate's certainly shifting
*  And but here's this is my point not that there's anything wrong with
*  Recognizing that we're doing irreparable harm to the atmosphere
*  We definitely are but we also should be aware that even if we weren't this motherfucker is not stable
*  It's not even if people had a zero impact on the environment absolute zero we don't take out we don't put back
*  It's perfect. It's a perfect balance and harmony. We're still fucked. We're gonna die before that. Yeah, we're still fucked
*  We need to wrap your head around that. I suppose that could be worded that way that it was an earth-size explosion
*  It does say that I mean when you compare hey
*  Look at that. I told you son. See I told you son
*  But isn't the air nice and ally now
*  I mean I used to have to clean soot off my porch all the time and now it's well
*  They burnt all those buildings down and just cleaned everything out
*  Which ones?
*  Although from the riots, yeah
*  Yeah, but the the no working is great for the air terrible for the economy
*  Super good for the air if you are buying a $30,000 car you have to buy a Tesla
*  Well, yeah, you we're doing a Tesla at a long to right I just feel like has it been long
*  How much are they paying us a lot good the penis with he keeps making cool sure it's amazing
*  I mean, yeah, I just want him to keep making cool stuff and succeed that Roadster is fucking vaporware though, son
*  What do you mean coming out? Oh, yeah?
*  Goddamn word. I want the Roadster. Well, they're on I love the truck. Where's the goddamn road?
*  Everything up up they what coming? Oh
*  Three days old. What is this? That's the tycan bro? That's a Porsche new Tesla Roadster next at Porsche tycan. That's the Roadster
*  It could be a CGI version which does look like it is look super CGI. Is that really the Roadster?
*  It has the roof on it. Oh, I see god damn it's beautiful though. It's gonna have a rockets in the back
*  That is what it looks like though, even though that's CGI
*  Since my eyes suck anyway for me I could be tricked. You know what? I can't be tricked by though
*  Model cars, what do you mean when I see a photo of a model car? Even if it's perfect? It's so weird
*  You're I don't know what that is. There's this thing going on. So microscopic with the shadows and right something you you're not conscious of
*  Whatever it is. I'm like bullshit
*  I call fake car, but you know what I mean? Like how do you know that a model car is fake, but you do I?
*  Haven't honestly tried Jamie Jamie do me a favor all cars Google
*  What do you got here, buddy? I'll tell you flying Tesla. Oh, that's right. It lifts off the ground
*  That's not happening zero to 60 in 1.1 seconds. That's the base. That's the base. Oh, that's not the basement
*  What kind of nonsense was I just talking about? What was I just saying I?
*  Mean it's just been two hours anything
*  Model cars you
*  Favorite fun game or a picture rather of a model car pull up a or a real one
*  1969 Corvette model car let's see that that sounds pretty reasonable also because it's a plastic car
*  Like the Corvette is actually a plastic vehicle like maybe maybe that would be better
*  Also or pull up a real one let's see if you can tell I'm trying to see if I can find a photographer that does
*  magic and see if there's a
*  But just give me a regular one first just give me a regular one first to
*  Base it off of because there's something like instantly you'll know and I don't know how you would ever describe this to other people
*  Let me see if I know no
*  Okay, I think that's that's a real car, bro. I know that car. That's actually a real car
*  You son of a bitch that's a what that is is a first of all make that bigger again
*  Cuz I'm a dick as hard as a rock that is a goddamn beautiful
*  That is um
*  Generation 3 that's a generation 3 Corvette. Maybe like I think
*  Between 67 and like in this early 70s that one's got the side pipes
*  And they got an extra wide-body kit on it, and I got a boner
*  That's America fuck yeah, don't go away from that car go back to that car son go back to that car
*  No, no go back go back. Here's the thing
*  It's not cuz that one's got a bold white stripe right down the fucking nose
*  That's ebony and ivory they live together in perfect harmony
*  I love those 1969 Corvette. Yes with side pipes and flared fucking that's what you don't get from a
*  electric car is feeling an engine and pulling on a
*  Shifting gears you don't get that you don't get the wildness you don't get any Leonard Skinner going on the back your head
*  But it's still it's better
*  It's like if I had to choose like one car to drive for the rest of my life would it be a hot rod every
*  Day or a Tesla, I'd be like I'm gonna take the Tesla. I remember the hot rod
*  It's gonna be always on you have the fastest
*  Tesla it's amazing
*  Also, just never going to the gas station is such a pleasure. Yeah, it's so pretty
*  Just pull up a model car. Okay, that's a model car. I
*  Don't know car. It's hard to tell. Yeah, the steering wheels looks a little fake, but it's a shitty photo
*  It's hard to tell it's not the resolution. It's not very good go to model car photos
*  That's literally what I typed in and that's what's coming up. So these cunts they're trying to trick you
*  Hmm. All right, let's try a model car
*  65 Mustang let's try one of those because the problem with these is like it's probably not as many
*  Model I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about
*  And I'm sure there's a lot of I assume there's gotta be an Instagram account
*  Oh, yeah, someone must I click on I know what I will have a click on that green one with the box
*  That's a fake one. Okay. There you can tell that's a fake
*  Yeah, it's hard to tell that looks fake as fuck no, but make it larger that's a perfect example
*  Actually look yeah, like something about you's like nah player
*  Right. You look at that. What is it though? I don't know Jamie. Look at it. What is it?
*  Something about that. I mean where it it's like in the middle of a white. I don't know man. I know it's little
*  I wonder if you put some people around that and some tire marksman. No, no, no
*  No, even if you I think even if you CGI people onto that picture that were like normal-sized people in relative to that car
*  Just keep it still for a second
*  Even if you CGI people on that you would still be like I don't buy it. There's something about the perspective
*  Here's here's one of the things
*  It's because it's a photograph, right?
*  It's not a digital photograph because you look at how it blurs in the background. Am I right Jamie?
*  A little bit that's just added in. Oh, it's added in. Okay, could be with the camera, but I think that's also
*  You recognize perspective and you're like just by the way the light is playing off that thing. It seems off
*  Yeah, it does have a force for tilt shift perspective which wouldn't normally happen which gives things a miniature look
*  Yeah, the gate it makes things look fake right that that might be a real car that they made look fake
*  It's amazing what happens in your subconscious you like we're having sure what's on it that is no blur
*  Let's see. That's a shitty picture though
*  You really kind of want to look
*  Yeah, I bet there's a lot of dudes like seriously into those fucking things
*  Miniature cars they have like cool dudes. They have like little displays of them around their house. Would you like to see my?
*  Anything you collect I think is it women aren't into nothing or woman. Oh, it's cool. You collect X
*  Do you think when no one's around they make the vroom vroom sound? Oh
*  My god, I had a roommate once you know that Star Wars came out with a two-sided lightsaber
*  Darth Maul. Yeah, I had a roommate New York was starting to just stand up and everything I come home
*  He's on his bed going wow wow wow grown man
*  But it was I bet it made him feel happy
*  Yeah, but then I he felt humiliated they came to him in the middle of the night
*  They said listen you don't have to live this life anymore
*  You live the same exact amount of years, but you're gonna live as Darth Maul
*  Is there a time where you would have changed your life? I assume no
*  Look at dark time again. I'm gonna switch this up
*  No, I enjoy life. I'm having fun. Yeah, but I think
*  I enjoy
*  There's this like weird challenges to life
*  That's part of what's fun about it like the part of what's fun is overcoming the things that are not fun
*  Just like figuring your way through problems and getting better at things and learning things and criticizing yourself and all that shit
*  Yeah, we're having if you go into the matrix man all that's over or the thing right there the thing
*  I don't think is right about is I think you can program the matrix to be annoying and hard
*  100% if you're gonna program it to be life just fuck it up and make it life life is now and then like that's the natural
*  Course progression that's the only way to keep entropy. It's the only way to keep things moving
*  I'm not looking at a good and bad. You have to have all the things together
*  It's the only way things get done. You have to have struggles. Otherwise, no improvement gets made
*  You have to have trauma. Otherwise love is not appreciated. You have all those things. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely
*  that's like
*  like
*  Like a rich, you know, like what's the thing that people load the most it might be a rich son
*  Absolutely a son who's arrogant. It didn't have to work for it. He's a piece of shit. He's meeting people
*  He's miserable. He didn't do anything to get it. That's a miserable fuck. I'm the happiest when I'm working really hard on right
*  And when it's done like when you make one of those videos and then you get a bunch of positive feedback from it
*  That's gotta be amazingly satisfying. Yeah, I mean I do it for free
*  And also like hurt meds girl help with that last one. I just wanna make sure well Kurt's but Kurt's fucking layers
*  He's great and we're doing we're working on making a show and it's like we're working so hard and no one is even asking for it
*  But it's it's really satisfying and I feel like about the money
*  You just keep doing those goddamn Instagram videos if you can just keep doing them. I think it's undeniable. It's so good
*  Some of those are so good. They're so mean
*  Yes, but I look back. Oh, yeah
*  Well Bill Maher asked for I mean he I didn't want to make a video bill Maher getting gang banged
*  He came on this program. He said my impression sucks
*  What am I supposed to do sit there listen I'm on your side with that one
*  He was by the way, it's very it's very funny. He should be laughing at that. That shit was hilarious
*  I mean even if you hate someone's impression, you have to pretend you like it. There's no saying you can't lie
*  You can't say it's not good. It's really good. Don't lie
*  Well that he when you said oh, let's play it he was like I'm leaving if you put he'd like threatened to leave you
*  Played it and by the way, I don't want to I'm really not mad at Bill Maher
*  I like having a nemesis. It's kind of feels good. So like Bill Maher
*  I like I'm really a lot of what he says the rants that he's been doing
*  During kovat have been the very best, you know the rants that he does the beginning of his show. I have all they're great, man
*  They're great. He's doing them with no audience, but they've been really funny and really good points
*  It's like he's actually ramped it up during this pandemic his some of those beginning of the show rants are excellent
*  He's great writers. So they got great writers, man
*  It's a it's a you know, it's a treasure that shows a national treasure
*  But he did he get gang banged in my video in your video you can bang
*  Also things together exactly, but also he acted like all right anyway, yes
*  I went to Hawaii didn't exist. He went I went to Hawaii with him in his private plane
*  Yes, I don't know him now in his defense. I'm sure I was invisible to him. He forgot me
*  But like you know into Beachman to dinners and and then he kind of got because he did know about the videos and he told
*  You he didn't and then he kind of anyway, listen listen. He's fine. I get it
*  He but I think in all do with all due respect. I think he's just looking at it the wrong way
*  I think it's funny and I think it doesn't make him any less brilliant
*  It doesn't make his show any less great and the show is great
*  I think we both admit it and those rants are brilliant. They're brilliant. I love his rants
*  I've I've tweeted a few of them out and said like bravo
*  I tweeted him out it paid me to make a video where he was getting gang banged hurt hurt me
*  I didn't want to do it. It should it's so funny, man
*  It's so funny and this is coming from a guy who's a fan of Bill Maher. I was laughing hard that I love that
*  You showed your wife and she was like, what's wrong with you?
*  I
*  There is a comedy is this uh, you know, it's different tastes different strokes, but yeah it is but it's also like
*  Come on, man. If you lighten up, it's almost all funny. I what I mean, there's some fart video
*  I think fart videos can are there's a place for them. I don't think there's a place for some people don't like them
*  I hear about it. There's a place for them. Yeah. Yeah a good fart
*  One of the funniest that that movie Norbit with Eddie Murphy never saw I saw it two nights ago
*  It was amazing. He plays three people in the movie
*  Like I didn't see it. I think it came out in 2007. I didn't see it dude. There's Norbit Norbit
*  Yeah, Eddie Murphy plays like a nerd character. He plays the nerds wife and then he plays this guy
*  Orphanage he plays a Chinese guy dude. It is
*  Amazing. It's so funny the funny parts the moment where he hits the big laughs
*  You're like, holy shit. That's him and him
*  Yeah
*  So that's Eddie playing the wife this enormous woman who rescues him from a sandbox
*  Spoiler alert when he's a little kid and like basically kidnaps him makes him become her husband
*  And she has her one of her brothers is Terry Crews and the other brothers are two dudes who are built
*  Just like Terry Crews just big fucking giant dudes
*  Just super jacked and they're all like trying to run some scam on this lady and Norbit has to fucking step in and save
*  The day dude, I'm telling you can we get these so silly? It's so fun
*  Like I laughed so hard at this movie. I saw hard
*  These are kind of movies that I want to watch now that are just so silly me away from
*  Can we get the Rotten Tomatoes on that? It's probably like 3% dude. They can suck my dick. That's a great movie
*  It's a funny movie. What is rotten tomatoes say?
*  Nine
*  They're wrong
*  Sacrifice the sacred plant to the hour to the fire gods and
*  Watch nor does it get a nine though. They're assholes a bunch of assholes in the world. They hate life. It's fucking great
*  Listen, I know it's funny. I laughed hard at that movie. I left hard. They just were looking forward to be something else
*  I mean the movie was basically like absurdist
*  Like it was really funny man and and Eddie Eddie Murphy played this racist Chinese guy
*  He would say racist shit to that simmer there, but it's him saying it
*  It's not a Chinese guy for so and it's in 2007
*  So it flies because he probably couldn't even Eddie probably couldn't even get away with doing that today
*  Like people would get so upset if they didn't realize it was Eddie saying that to Eddie
*  Do you think we'll ever get back to a point where?
*  We already brought this up. I like
*  you can
*  The creaking do some other culture
*  I know you can do Italians you can do this but you can make fun of Italians Irish people English people
*  You just can't like make fun of anybody that we decide is disenfranchised or recent immigrants
*  It's a flips. Okay, and it can then like Asians are like running America, right?
*  Can there be comedy where a white guy does an Asian there can be that right now nobody cares
*  I think they do I think you can't do that. Listen, man
*  Um a black guy can do white face with zero problems. Yeah, it's because there was never an Al Jolson for white people
*  Right, right what it is?
*  Probably part man fucking dancing with the white gloves on it. What is that?
*  It's bad on top of everything else. What's I would pay a thousand dollars
*  For an oculus game that puts you and me in the front row
*  We both put the headphones on just to be uncomfortable apple boxes
*  We watch a minstrel show that's in a tent in the middle of Kansas in the early 1900s when you're like, oh my gosh
*  I just kill myself. I like if you know how this thing turns out
*  That's one of the last places if I could go through time or put one of those
*  Oculus things on would be I would like it would just be really uncomfortable to Dorothy was happy
*  She got picked up by a goddamn tornado. She was happy. Yeah brought to the land of Oz
*  You get to see all kinds of she got ruby slippers. Oh that look that her poor life
*  Here about like the munchkins were molesting her. She's getting like the real my I don't know. Yeah, there she is
*  That's her Judy Garland with blackface. Oh my god. That's crazy
*  Normal thing she went blackface with buckwheat hair. She doubled it up just
*  That's crazy
*  Wow
*  But that was a normal thing it's like they decided that I guess they decided that
*  They wanted to put black people in films without putting actual black people in films and making them famous
*  So they said we got to work around here
*  You should make white people black people and everyone's gonna know like did they know what Al Jolson looked like in real life?
*  Or was it like kiss in the 70s? I
*  Had a I have a problem with kiss cuz I had a roommate in college who loved kiss
*  And he would he had a girlfriend in our little tiny dorm room
*  And they so he's like a college where it's zero degrees out
*  You have the windows open have to get up because I'd be breathing frost and he would bang this girl
*  And he just loved kiss and you take triple-dip acid go out and stare at the Sun and come back
*  And then one day he rearranged our furniture. So I come home and the door won't open
*  And he put the refrigerator in front of the door and he's like I rearranged the apartment. I'm like you can't put the
*  That we can't open the door. He was just so high. Anyway, I associate kiss with him and fight. I'll never
*  I'll never like kiss
*  Boy that guy can sell though Jean. Oh, he sells he sells Paul Stanley can sing his ass off, too
*  There's some great fucking songs kiss had some great songs
*  Come on and love me you ever hear that song how's I go?
*  I wish I could play for you get pulled off. I know I know Beth. What can I do? That's a great song
*  It's a good song. I want to rock and roll all night. I don't already every day. I don't like that
*  I don't like that song
*  I have too much kiss drama. Oh, you gotta let it go man. It's a great band
*  I had the total opposite my uncle was an artist for
*  the very talent company
*  The or the advertising company that did their album covers. Oh, so those are great
*  Yeah, my uncle worked in the place kind of trying to remember the name of the out
*  This is Paul Stanley right here Jean Simmons son old-school branding was so good. This is like kiss alive two days
*  I know what the fuck this is son. You know what the fuck's going on
*  This is a great this is the great fucking music man
*  But for me, it just locks me into that time
*  So you can't show it cuz then they'll charge you a royalty. Oh man life dude
*  We had Gary Clark jr. Did a cover of
*  Midnight Rider cover of it and we played the cover
*  No, we're gonna charge you for that. They took the fucking they just take your money. Give me that fucking money. That's ours
*  I cannot make they own the song
*  That's ours I cannot make the song yeah even a cover which by the way he needs to release that
*  He needs to release that I need to if I do anything before I die
*  I need to talk honey honey and Gary Clark jr. Into doing another version of Midnight Rider
*  Gotta be here before you die. Have you ever heard it? No, can't play it for you. Yeah play it for him
*  Let him take the money these fucks
*  These fucking thieves you fuck the one that they did on the Instagram
*  Yeah, they
*  It's just it's so
*  distinctive
*  So good, but they they fucking
*  They have like YouTube copyright claims on all kinds of stuff
*  Like you can't show parts of films if it was up to me
*  I would start off every podcast with Clint Eastwood talking to the Comanches
*  These are my words of life and also my words of death
*  Ever see that in the outlaw Josie Wales, so this is them. This is a small club in
*  Downtown and there's probably like
*  What's our who is this? That's my friend Suzanne Santo and Ben Joffe
*  They're a band called honey honey and that motherfucker behind the guitar is one of the baddest ever do it. That's Gary Clark, Jr
*  It's I just thought about being how long it's been since I've been in a club of any kind. I
*  Know right I'm doing Houston next weekend. Oh, yeah
*  Do they give you any restriction?
*  Don't spit in people's mouths
*  That was your big closer. That's how I was gonna end
*  No, man, just go have some fun. They don't have like a restriction on number of people in the room or thing
*  75% capacity
*  They they trimmed it down only 25%
*  Just take care of yourself folks get your vitamins in
*  That's saying take your vitamin D wear a fucking mask do what you gotta do
*  Is that true? The D is the important one. It's huge. It's huge. It's huge for a lot of things
*  It's huge for muscle development. It's huge for brain function
*  It's it's a hormone apparently as well according to dr. Rhonda Patrick's whose ladies been on my podcast before
*  she was explaining that all these people that were in the intensive care unit with kovat a
*  Giant percentage of them like more than 80% of them in one study
*  Had in at insufficient levels of vitamin D and only 4% had sufficient levels
*  And so then she told me that 70% of the United States is deficient in vitamin D
*  70% on the Sun as much exactly and only
*  29% have sufficient vitamin D, which is just like bunkers only 29% Oh, no, no, no, excuse me
*  29%
*  What was it I want to say had
*  insufficient no 20
*  I'm fucking the numbers up, but there was a very small number of people like if it was
*  70% or deficient there was a certain number of people that had insufficient levels to the point where they were
*  Vulnerable their immune system was vulnerable and they could get more disease. It was a large number fucking up the number though
*  I'm always low on D every time you don't go outside man. If you don't go outside and you don't take it
*  You're not gonna get it. Yeah, I do take it but they're what they're discovering is there's like a whole
*  There's a lot of things that have to interact
*  Together in your body to keep you healthy, you know, you have to have electrolytes
*  You have to have amino acids. You have to have vitamins
*  You have to have all these things and when one of them is missing and one of them is severely missing
*  What a really important one like vitamin D
*  The whole thing gets thrown into whack and you get vulnerable that's part of what we're showing here. There's a there's a
*  Metabolic vulnerability that a lot of people have and it's not just that the virus is scary
*  But it's also that people have really fucked up immune systems because they're not healthy because they're not getting enough vitamins
*  And they're not when you find all these athletes that catch this disease and shake it off like it's nothing you got to go
*  Okay, we're talking yesterday about these NBA players that got it. No symptoms. They just got it
*  Yeah, and they're fine
*  I know a bunch of people that have got it like that like man. I don't know
*  I think this this is showing vulnerability and people's immune systems more than anything
*  We should be really concerned about that on top of being concerned about spreading the disease
*  Goddamn, we got to spread information on how to strengthen your immune system. Yeah, I mean that vitamin D is by a good tip
*  It's a good tip
*  But it's only the tip of the iceberg the water is important drink a lot of water stay hydrated have a lot of electrolytes have
*  Vitamins all the whiskey hot make sure you get high at least once a day so you can sleep good and be scared all the time
*  There's a lot of shit going on man, but we're only here in one side
*  Yeah, I
*  I've been a doctor in a while knock on wood. I feel pretty healthy
*  I used to I was diagnosed with celiac disease gonna be in the doctor after Bill Maher finds you
*  Should I be scared of him? I should be
*  With you what would Bill Maher do it's swing right funny like why
*  Don't shoot my dick with cocaine. Okay, people
*  Here comes cocaine into your cock. Okay
*  You fuck it's so good. That's such a good impression. Anyone says it's not a good impression. Come on
*  I yeah, I mean I do a lot of impressions. They're not all good. I some are like pretty I think my Elan's pretty weak
*  But my bill's pretty good your bills pretty good. It's very good
*  You can't get shit on me Caitlyn Jenner is her yeah, baby. That's her voice now
*  Yeah, see her speaking any other way she was
*  Well, she does that because she's I think she's alone a lot she answers herself, you know, she'll be like, yeah
*  Why don't you get some shoes? Yeah, and she's going yeah, I bought some Jimmy choose me. Yeah
*  How weird where's Kim?
*  Anybody that thinks that that's a superficial aspect of our culture today. You're on mine that
*  Bruce Jenner's now Caitlyn Jenner's no big deal like that that that all the weirdness of it
*  Not saying that she shouldn't be able to do that
*  She absolutely should but the weirdness of that sort of defines like how crazy life is today
*  It's almost like you're seeing these little hints when you're getting close to the end of the game. Yeah
*  The narratives falling apart the fucking plot gets weirder and weirder you're like, oh my god, when is the big reveal?
*  He's an Olympic and then at the end of it aliens. Yeah. Yeah
*  Well, you watch that new now
*  There's a new footage or simulation of the car crash because he really that thought the lady stopped in front of him
*  But her it was him was Bruce at the time
*  But it looks like now that she just plowed right through these two people
*  And pushed him right into traffic right and died
*  Yeah, and I don't know if this simulations right but the one I saw in the new theory is that like she was on her phone
*  Not that they know what she was doing but the lady in front of her
*  Didn't slam on her brakes. It was like they were coming to us. They were slowing down for a light
*  But we tell you how progressive I feel saying she yeah, I keep saying she she's you are your hero
*  I think she was Bruce back then. Yeah, she was Bruce. So what do you say about that? Yeah, Bruce did it?
*  God that Bruce can't drive. Huh? Anyway woman of the year, baby
*  That's what happened woman of the year after that. Yeah. Yeah
*  Right pretty soon pretty weird
*  Family feel that not good their mom died and then they're like, oh the speech of the woman of the year
*  Oh, yeah, my mom pretty upset about that. Yeah, I mean, I don't want I don't know what the ax was exactly but it
*  It looks like
*  Pretty bad, but it's weird how rarely it's discussed
*  That's what's weird it came in such a time where you you were
*  Transphobic if you said anything about her back, so it was like the perfect timing
*  For murder. It was a murder
*  For someone getting away with it. Yeah. Yeah, everybody was so
*  enthralled
*  With the idea that she was beautiful and like there was here. I'm brave
*  Yeah, beautiful hero brave and I'm like, hey
*  And also that was Bruce and it was like you couldn't even say really
*  Comfortably Bruce anymore. And so Caitlin didn't do it Caitlin didn't do it
*  Like she dodged the bullet perfect timing. Yeah gonna
*  Scream someone into a Hummer across traffic. That's a good time. I wonder if that was what pushed her to come out
*  You know what? Can't imagine assume let's stop. What's she out before that? She definitely
*  Which is long hair and we're making up we're just
*  We don't know
*  You must be homophobic or transphobic but that that may have hurried things up. It might have been the catalyst
*  I would have yeah, I'll tell you if I did that and I was trans in January. I'd bump up that
*  Appointment imagine if there was like a PR guy and he's like, I got a plan. Well, I mean anybody
*  Everyone in your family with a vagina is making a lot of money. You're doing terrible
*  Jimmy come on who's gonna fuck you now? Anyway, Rob's nice. Let's get this party started. All right
*  Let's keep that action. Hush hush
*  Look at my garden, you know, it's funny about you know, you've seen it
*  Seeing what? Oh, I know Chloe made a video where she was like, we're mad at you. She she kept doing that
*  I didn't say my
*  I have a video where they just all say that's hilarious
*  Look, they got it. They must have a good sense of humor. They've been taking abuse for more than a decade now
*  Yeah, I I think mine's so cartoonish. Yeah, I know when you make them make the noises
*  Oh my two girls
*  Actually quote I saw somebody on Twitter that actually said stop calling people Karen's it's
*  Misogynistic and it's just a convenient way of you saying bitch
*  Really?
*  You can't
*  People just can't stop they can't stop correcting people
*  No, they can't stop telling people what to do
*  They can't stop get their life is a fucking mess and they can't stop correcting other people
*  It's gotta feel good. You gotta get some charge out of it. You imagine you can't call people a Karen
*  I know a lot of Karen's and they're really nice people. So fuck off. Yeah, Karen's are great the haircut
*  I love little angled haircut, but there's like women their name is Karen. It's nothing wrong with that
*  Oh, yeah actual Karen's but if you complain your Karen's gonna it's just gonna stick around
*  Someone's saying don't call women to Karen because it is a Karen. Oh, that's so dumb. You're so silly
*  Like you should be laughing at all this. This is not if your name is Karen. Well, I could get why you're upset
*  For all these years you skated by and then for fucking whatever reason Karen became the complaining white lady
*  Do you know how was it first a Karen was patient zero? I have no idea maybe name for it
*  It's a perfect name. Maybe that's why it just seems perfect. Yeah, who else would it be?
*  Oh Karen's calling Helen maybe a Helen Helen's too old, right Helen's mean
*  Caitlin's to or Catherine Caitlin's owned by Caitlyn Jenner forever. No kids calling their daughter Caitlin now. It's like just too risky
*  Yeah, Caitlin
*  Caitlin is it's like you can't call your kid Madonna
*  Right right you can't call you kid Caitlin either my parents shouldn't have called her Madonna. I don't think they did
*  Oh, she made that I think she yeah, her last name is a could she own you or something could she own something like that?
*  I think she had a real name at one point in time in her life. She's fallen. She's I don't know
*  It's trying to be nice. No, I'm just like I I don't have enough information with anything
*  I'm stopping myself. I hear rumors and I let people yeah, that's a good move
*  Yeah, that's a good move just spread the word let let the information it's not stopping anybody else. No, it's not
*  It doesn't matter even with all this information that's available. Why should I look something? Yeah, why should you these fucks?
*  The way to do what they don't even do they're bidding there is a lot of conversations. I don't if you've noticed where
*  Were they you think you're having a conversation with somebody but really they're just checking if you agree with every single thing
*  They're saying and then you get this venom if you diverge from
*  It's really weird, but I've had a few bump ins with the so that if you diverge from their ideology at all
*  They get that. Yeah, I mean the rage that comes up surprised me a couple of times like a cult feeling of your
*  Saying the wrong. I don't know. What were the subjects? I mean black labs Latin matter. Mm-hmm
*  I I mean, I you know, I'm my brother cop and so it's like I have a little
*  Well, you are in a position what like
*  You agree. I think with a lot of reasonable people that what that guy did was horrific
*  Yeah murder murder awful and good put him in jail forever and there's definitely racism and it's something definitely that we
*  Well, there's also a personal issue with that guy and and the cop apparently, you know about that
*  They were they apparently work together and then they had words they they had a comp
*  Yeah, because the cop was apparently very aggressive towards customers
*  Yeah, and they they got angry at each other over. So this is a personal thing in a lot of ways
*  Yeah, but that said defunding the police is crazy. That's a very dumb idea. I mean they're underfunded
*  Yeah, it's also the job. I just know it's just so hard you imagine going to where people are being assholes every day all day for decades
*  And you've just it's just a they would never do this, but I think part of reform should be
*  Meditation I mean they would never do this but if you wake up in the morning you put a bulletproof vest on you go to work
*  You say about your family. It's a it's really a mentally anguishing and this is
*  Not to say there's a reason not something to deal with. I think it's great what's happening, but it's just I
*  Don't I personally get when the pendulum's you know falling too hard the other way against police
*  when the vast majority
*  And my brother just like a really nice emotionally intelligent guy who's just you know
*  something getting spit on and stuff it's just like
*  Doesn't feel good, but I think people being very short-sighted
*  What is that you need the police you need the police you just need a better trained police?
*  Yeah, if I mean if the other side didn't have guns I'd be like okay. I take with our guns
*  But even then man you're gonna have bigger stronger people taking your shit because you don't have guns
*  Yeah, listen it's not none of it is good. You need a police you just need the police need to be better funded
*  They need to be better trained
*  And they they like all of us need to get better
*  I think the police of today are probably way better than the police of 50 years ago
*  But that's still when you see what some of them have done to peaceful protesters
*  While letting looters get away with it is like this is this system is broken. It's
*  There's no way it's not broken. It's a huge mess and hopefully like you said it'll ironed out and stuff
*  Well, Minneapolis is gonna be an interesting case study because if they do defund their police
*  I don't I don't know what they're gonna replace it with or how they're gonna redo it
*  I hope they redo it with more money, but it doesn't seem like they're going to
*  They should pay people more money because it's a fucking horrifically dangerous job
*  And they should train people much better and they should train people more often that is it
*  I mean, yeah, because if you don't get into a situation
*  And often I mean, you know from jujitsu probably you need to keep training to be calm
*  Yes, all these cops and all that mistakes happen because they're freaked out. Yeah, adrenaline's running
*  Yeah bad decision and they don't they don't have any confidence in handling themselves and also they're in a physical confrontation
*  With some guy who's been thinking about punching them for the last three minutes. Yeah, the guys thinking when should I punch this cop?
*  When should I punch this cop? No, sir. No, sir. I
*  Didn't think I was going fast. He's thinking I'm gonna punch this motherfucker
*  I'm just waiting for my time and then boom all sudden you're in a physical confrontation
*  You don't know what to do. Yeah, if you get hit first, yeah, you're in trouble. And also there's a gun
*  The cop has a gun. Yeah, once you're wrestling
*  It's never know when to pull their gun and then there's also sociopaths. Are you got guys who are cops?
*  They're sociopaths. They can't wait to kill people. They can't wait to shoot people. Yeah, they want to thrill
*  They don't feel anything in regular life
*  They want to be able to kill somebody and blame it on you know, this person's a criminal or whatever
*  There's there are real people that want to shoot people
*  I mean that that's that's a part of life too and we've seen videos man
*  See videos of people shooting people and cops shooting people for no fucking reason
*  it's it's horrific and I think it's just a symptom of the job man because it's it's a
*  It's happening all over the place it's happening whenever it seems like whenever cops get ramped up and they have you know
*  A lot of power and they're holding a gun
*  There's a person in front of them and there's some sort of a dispute and they're yelling get on the fucking ground like that guy
*  Might get shot. Yeah, that guy might get shot whether that guy's Asian or European or black
*  He's gonna get shot by the right guy in the right situation. And that's what the statistics show
*  statistics show
*  That although there are these horrific cases like that George Floyd case when you get to watch it
*  There's less of those than there were in like 2015. There's less doesn't mean it's good
*  But there's less black men are killed by cops now and there was before but one is too many
*  You know and when you when you see that part of what you're seeing it's not just racism
*  You're also seeing just the abuse that comes when someone has that kind of power over people and there are a
*  Simple-minded fuckhead and you've given them the kind of power that a cop has. Yeah some there's some bad bad fucking people man
*  There's fun. There's bad people that do every job man. It's bad people that are construction workers. Who's bad people that are cops
*  It's just yeah
*  Then the problem is when they fuck up
*  It's so public and it's such a big deal because they have so much more power
*  Right there position is so crazy the guy who has a gun who's literally telling you get on the fucking ground
*  You have to listen to him. Yeah, no other time in life
*  Do you have to listen to a man tell you to get on the ground?
*  This guy is actually working for you. He's working with your tax dollars you pay for the police
*  Yeah, like this is crazy. This guy's about to shoot me and I pay him
*  Yeah, you know and it's weird, you know, because if it was a regular guy telling you get on the ground
*  He'd be like why you know, cuz I smell weed like fuck you like you're just a regular guy
*  But because he's a cop even though he's still a regular guy
*  He has all this power to tell you what to do. It's it's fucking very strange. Mm-hmm. I just being a cop
*  Psychologically is very strange in a lot of ways and what strong people to do that job. That's what you need
*  I need to pay them well
*  It's just like who now is gonna be like I want to be a cop when I grow up
*  Somebody needs to come forth and say that some governor needs to say that in an eloquent way
*  Like you guys are looking at this wrong. We need better people
*  We need to put more money into the community more money into the police force more more money into
*  Training these fucking people we need to make everybody safer
*  The way to make people safer is not have less cops and less funding
*  It's still have better cops better paid cops
*  Maybe even more cops and more funding and make sure that they never fucking do that
*  Never and any abuse at all you instantly get rid of them any abuse at all. Everyone's wearing a body camera
*  No exceptions every altercation gets reviewed any abuse gets reported and you can't do that man
*  And if you don't know how to handle someone without getting abusive and you're doing an effective an ineffective version of that job
*  And you're you're probably dangerous to other cops because you're gonna leave it in that person's head that cops are assholes
*  Cops treat you like shit cops hit you whenever a cop does that for no reason
*  He doesn't just fuck over that person
*  He fucks over all the people who watch that video all the people who get mad at cops and that's what you're seeing today
*  You're seeing this probably even though it's less things are happening to folks because of bad cops
*  More people are seeing it than ever before. Yeah, so our idea of what a cop is is just way out of whack right now
*  Yeah, and that town
*  in Seattle
*  What happened there? There was no police and they just took over it. It's a little festival. I don't understand fun. I
*  Don't understand how they were like, okay scram the cops were like I can't go in it. They don't want me in there
*  Yeah, man, I don't know how that's gonna play out
*  I'm sure good. I'm sure that will add well called the chas. Is that right?
*  Yeah, you know autonomous zone
*  Capitol Hill autonomous zone call it chas
*  How did they get say leave cops and the cops left? Like what was that moment?
*  Well, if I had a guess it's because there's not enough cops and not well-funded weren't prepared for this bad government a
*  Bunch of people that are anarchist all organized got together did something chaotic
*  Business owners fled people panic they gave up power to these folks
*  They were espousing an ideology that on paper at least seems sort of admirable given power to the people
*  You know getting rid of corruption getting rid of some of the bad aspects of capitalism
*  This is like there's all sorts of parts of it that sold people on the idea, but it's not good
*  They don't own any of those buildings. They didn't build them
*  They can't just take them you shouldn't because that's piracy because someone just comes into your neighborhood and takes your fucking house
*  That's piracy pirate. You can't just let these people take over this blog. Look at the people's man. We don't allow money
*  Okay
*  Well, you don't have to allow money
*  But you can't stop other people from using money you fuck just like we don't stop you from trading with tomatoes if you want to fucking
*  I'll give you three tomatoes if you give me that camera if I'm like, okay good deal
*  Well, you're allowed to do that. Yeah, but you're not allowed to tell people they can't use money
*  So they have like a whole zone where there's no money like oh, come on man. This is step one to fascism
*  You guys gonna make your own fascism and then there was a video
*  I saw this one guy was filming something so these other guys came over and beat the shit out of them
*  I'm like, oh great. So then you treat one of your own the same way cops treat you
*  Congratulations, they're eventually gonna make up police they won't call it that but of course there's gonna be people that patrol just like the do
*  You remember the guardian angels? Yeah
*  I was in traffic once and there was this guardian angel and this dude was like
*  Doughy like little baby arms and a little gut. I'm like, this is crazy. This guy's protecting anybody from anything
*  Looking at him with my friend. Well, can you look at this motherfucker and he looks to me goes
*  Double fingers double fingers just stared in the windshield. We didn't even say anything
*  We didn't say like hey, man, what the fuck you guarding bro. You didn't say anything like that. We just looked at him
*  I was like, look at this motherfucker. Look at this guy right here. That's the guardian angel
*  He's out. He's out there protecting people and he gave you the double bird. He gave me the double bird
*  We're in an angry face. I was like, oh you shouldn't have that job
*  You shouldn't be standing in the middle of cars patrolling like what are you patrolling?
*  Where was this in New York New York City? Yeah, and then the main guy was on a radio show
*  And there was some sort of a scandal
*  we're like he
*  He said he stopped some sort of a crime that didn't really go. I think I remember that. Yeah, we were there
*  I saw him on TV. He's like still in the local news there. He still is
*  But wasn't there some?
*  That's him
*  Think so. Yeah, that's him. Yeah
*  So it was real weird. They had the t-shirt on and the berets they'd walked down the street and dudes had like look at
*  That one dude has like look at the chain mail. He's got kiss. It brings him right back to kiss
*  Oh, damn it. Gene Simmons wrist straps
*  That's cool idea
*  It's preposterous son. No, what about like just their presence making people think twice about
*  Crime you see that guy. Oh, yeah, bro. I hear you. I'm saying
*  I had all the superheroes in Seattle walking around a couple years ago, right?
*  But that's different those guys actually knew how to fight that was we talked about that that was not all of them
*  I would say I don't know how many of them were actually trying to stop crime
*  These guys were actually trying to stop crime was very strange. It was like organized vigilantes unarmed organized vigilantes
*  They had no power to do anything right there. Well, they could beat your ass
*  That
*  Sucks when that guy gave me the double fingers was like hmm
*  Hmm, I just think you might be a little bit jumping the gun here
*  Imagine if a cop did that if you saw a cop in traffic and you're like this fucking guy with a stupid blue outfit
*  He's like
*  You he'd be like, oh my god, that guy shouldn't be a cop, right?
*  so why should this guy be a guardian angel I
*  Think we should vet if that existed we should vet them
*  But they disbanded yes luckily
*  Yeah, they fell apart, but that's probably what's gonna happen in a lot of these that police free zones
*  You're gonna have weirdos who want to be fake cops wearing berets
*  wandering around giving people the finger
*  That's like in their code of what to do there's a lot of people out there that don't understand the importance of the police
*  You're fucking up man. You're fucking it up for everybody else, too
*  You're fucking it up for everybody else, too
*  Who are you gonna call when someone breaks in your house if there's no one to call?
*  There's gonna be more people breaking in your house. Oh, yeah, if they take away the guns from cops
*  I mean, oh my god bank robberies will be successful 100% of the time
*  What's gonna stop you from robbing jewelry stores every day
*  47 so dumb it's so dumb like if you this should be something where it gets argued where there's a meeting
*  Where you show all the interactions that the police have had with with the community all the interactions every single one of them
*  It gets detailed and documented and then you say well how many of these were negative and you look at it
*  If there was like three or four like really strongly negative ones
*  What about all the positive ones? What about all the people that were protected? What about all the robberies that were stopped?
*  What about all the all the crimes that were prevented?
*  What about all the people that were arrested that were murderers and rapists and all that are you gonna do that now?
*  Are we just gonna pretend that shit doesn't exist because there's all these interactions that the cops have and there's some of them that
*  Are negative you're right. It's not no one's saying that's not true
*  Maybe there's to throw it all out like if you were arguing that like from data from a data perspective
*  If you were in a meeting and they're like look we have these these are the bad interactions and these
*  All these papers are the good interactions
*  Yeah, okay. Well rationally we need to stop that from happening. How do we do that?
*  How do we eliminate or at least radically reduce the number of bad interactions you'd work on that you wouldn't say defund the police
*  That's like a fucking virtue gesture like look at me. We're gonna defund. We're gonna just plant flowers. Yay
*  I might be ignorant, but I feel like it's called that to cause
*  Controversies or gets attention. I mean they said reform the police
*  Maybe I'm ignorant and they really mean to defund that it just seems like the fund specifically
*  Maybe they're gonna they're gonna if they give cops like you're saying before other jobs
*  Then they're gonna have dudes with clubs with nails hanging out of them
*  It's gonna be dudes with baseball bats wrapped in chainmail like that Deegan dude from Deegan. Yeah from
*  Walking dead. What's his name? Oh, yeah, Negan Negan. That's his name, right? The mean guy kills people at a baseball bat. Yeah
*  Fuck that guy, right? That guy's gonna be everywhere that guy. He's gonna control in van eyes
*  Yeah, people like that everywhere you look, you know, I'd get a gun
*  That's another thing if you take away guns from cops, then everyone has to buy a gun exactly
*  Dude, it's terrible. You can't do this. This is such a dumb idea and
*  Also, you can't do it in a city where that thing didn't happen either. It's not even the same people
*  You're one guy was a horrible person and then another guy was a horrible person in Atlanta
*  But there's a million cops like you can't I don't know how many there are it's probably there's one million
*  Yeah, there are a lot of fucking cops man. Yeah, there's
*  Hundreds of thousand interactions of that are not good that that are happening all the time, especially with the protests and stuff
*  there's a lot of interaction and
*  Look, I think everybody got the message
*  I think through this George Floyd thing everybody got the message and the people that are gonna flare up
*  That are still behaving the same way like that guy who shot that guy in Atlanta
*  They get charged with murder man right away right away right away felony murder
*  You get the death penalty that guy and he probably should
*  He probably should the way shot that guy if he really knew that that guy had a taser that didn't even work
*  Yeah, it's murder
*  What's crazy is if you watch the video the guy's compliant. I know and for 20 minutes like can you just pull over?
*  They don't want to do the paperwork. Yeah, they're like, can you just yeah
*  He's compliant and he wants he just wants him to get him an uber, right?
*  Isn't that what he said?
*  Didn't he say something along those lines with it really should have done that
*  there should be a way that you could ticket someone maybe even take their license away, but like
*  Get them home. Don't fucking put him in a cage like they did something stupid and they shouldn't be allowed to drive
*  They should definitely pay a fine. They should definitely get in trouble for driving intoxicated for sure
*  But do you really need to be violent with them and locked them in a cage?
*  I don't know if that's the case and not in that guy's case the way that guy was interacting with a cop
*  It seems like he just was fucked up and just wanted to go home suddenly
*  It just went yeah
*  because that's what we're talking about before like when a
*  Cop has to worry when he's talking to a guy the guy could be like super kind and just thinking about punching him in
*  The face like if I was in a situation like in a movie like a born identity movie
*  Yeah, and there was a cop that was interrogating me and he was saying something to me and he kept closing in on me
*  I'm gonna have to knock this cop out
*  Okay, I don't want him to know I'm gonna hit him. So I'm just gonna be really compliant. That's what I would do
*  Yeah, I would go well, sir. I
*  Definitely didn't know that that was happening. No, sir. Yeah
*  Well in the pain
*  You got to be able to do it whether or not they don't know you're gonna do it
*  I saw the exactly like that last night
*  This guy was just being really cool and the cops I can't just check you, you know search a little bit
*  He's a game and he's dead they don't show the actual last moments, but yeah, that's how it goes down man
*  It can easily go down like that where someone could pretend
*  They'll pretend they're being nice to you and then they shoot you the cops watch these they make them watch them say like this could happen
*  But you know, it's fucked up dude. I was reading about the the Comanche is doing that to settlers to the people have always done that
*  Yeah, everything's fine. Everything's fine. Then they fuck him up. That's like an old trick
*  Yeah, like I was reading this horrible story about or listening to this horrible story about these Comanches that came into this people's houses and
*  They came in they just wanted their food
*  They said let me have food and then people fed them and then after they ate they said go now no hurt
*  Go vamos no hurt. They like they forced the people out of their own house
*  Yeah, and the people just didn't know what to do. They just like what's wrong. They just started running across the field
*  They got about a half a mile the Comanches found them and one lady who was pregnant
*  They cut the top of her head off like and they scalped her from the ears up
*  So they literally cut all while she was alive
*  But all the skin from her ears all the way to they remove the top skin of her skull
*  They cut it off and took it with them and they they shot her full of arrows and she survived for a couple days and gave birth
*  To a stillborn baby. No, bro
*  This is this is what people were capable of in
*  1840 right so just
*  That's with the same thing as those people
*  We're the same thing and when shit goes fucking completely sideways
*  I was watching this thing in New Mexico
*  Where this one kid hit this guy with a skateboard and then pulled a knife out on the guy and the guy reaches out of his
*  Fucking pants and pulls a gun and shoots the dude down and I'm like, oh my god
*  Like this is that one of those like take down a statue rallies
*  Yeah, it's like fuck people are losing their mind. I mean, it's not
*  That kind of horrific violence is not that far removed from that shit that was going on with the the settlers and the Plains Indians
*  It's not that far removed man. It's like you're only a couple incidents away
*  Nobody thought we'd be seeing that on a regular basis people having gunfights on the street a dude getting attacked by Antifa
*  He fucking lights him up with a nine millimeter and drops him while everyone's screaming who the fuck when when did you ever see that?
*  That's pretty rare now. There's like a new video every couple of days or something crazy happening
*  Oh
*  Well now that we've cheered everyone up I think I've been hilarious the past hour
*  You were very good the entire three hours. We've did it. Have we been here three hours three? Oh my god. It's 320 right?
*  Yeah, anyway, sorry Jamie. Come on bro. Let me go home. It's awesome. This was really fun
*  It's always awesome. Thank you. And I want to take this home. You take that home. You can have another one
*  You want another one? Yeah, I do freshie
*  We actually have weed giveaway bags because here in California this one good thing marijuana is legal
*  It's one of the only good things. Yeah, I worked out. Yes. Oh, yeah
*  They looked at the crime rates that shows you how fucked up our government is they can't balance the economy even with all that weed money
*  Is it helping at all? Yeah, it's helping them get rich
*  All that weed money think about how much more money is pumped into the economy and these fucking twats can't manage it. Yeah
*  Let's go to that town
*  Seattle oh
*  Chas Chas hang out. Yeah, sure. It's just like communists start our lives there
