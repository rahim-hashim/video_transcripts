# JRE MMA Show #146 with Francis Ngannou
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up champ? How are you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=10.0s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=15.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=16.0s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=17.0s)]
*  So you have been on a journey my friend. A lot of things have happened. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=18.0s)]
*  First of all, congratulations on securing this fight. That is a big deal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=23.0s)]
*  A lot of people doubted it was going to happen. You were right. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=27.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Yes, it was a big deal. It wasn't easy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=30.0s)]
*  But we finally get it. I get the help of a lot of people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=34.0s)]
*  And the Saudi were very interested in this fight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=41.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was one of those fights where you had to take a big gamble by relinquishing your UFC crown. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=45.0s)]
*  I didn't relinquish anything. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=52.0s)]
*  You didn't relinquish it? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=55.0s)]
*  Well fill me in then. Tell me what happened. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=56.0s)]
*  Well we didn't come to an agreement. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=58.0s)]
*  You didn't come to an agreement? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=60.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=61.0s)]
*  So you decided I'm not signing with the UFC. You're a free agent. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=62.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=65.0s)]
*  And then did the negotiations then start for the Tyson Fury fight? How did it start? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=66.0s)]
*  You know it's been like four years since Tyson Fury and I have been going back and forth on social media. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=73.0s)]
*  So there was a little bit of a warm up somewhere there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=80.0s)]
*  And it kind of like took a couple months before we get to a conversation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=83.0s)]
*  You know it wasn't just easy. Those boxing promotions. The boxing world is a little wild. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=92.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little different. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=97.0s)]
*  It's completely different. It's a different animal. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=98.0s)]
*  In what way? Like explain to us. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=101.0s)]
*  The way that they do things. You know it's this guy from this promotion fighting against this guy from this promotion who has a better position, who has what to lose, who is getting what. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=103.0s)]
*  And then how they kind of like put things. I would not say manipulate but a little bit like that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=116.0s)]
*  Everybody trying to adjust things on his own benefit. Look what is good for him, which is good. But yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=124.0s)]
*  A lot of boxing fights don't get made. They get talked about for a long time like Tyson Fury and Usyk. For a long time was Terrence Crawford and Earl Spence. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=132.0s)]
*  They get talked about for a long time and they almost get made and then they don't get made and they almost get made and they don't get made. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=142.0s)]
*  A lot of politics behind. A lot of promotion that would be behind the fight just to you know push their position. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=149.0s)]
*  Everybody's pushing his position. It's not more. It's not mostly about the fight. It's about like okay what we we control the game. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=158.0s)]
*  Do we have enough control here? Do we control everything? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=168.0s)]
*  So was it frustrating for you because I imagine there was a while where you weren't sure whether or not it was going to be made. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=173.0s)]
*  It wasn't frustrating. You know before I made my I made my decision when I separated with the UFC and I knew. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=180.0s)]
*  I mean long time before like I remember even when I fought Syringan before even before that fight. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=190.0s)]
*  I was telling myself and I was even telling this on interview like okay if this is the end then he has to end my way. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=197.0s)]
*  You know so not because I was sure that is going to happen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=206.0s)]
*  I knew that he could have not happened right. But I was I was to be in peace with my decision. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=211.0s)]
*  So that's that's the thing about it. And I'm very happy that he happens. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=219.0s)]
*  Makes it even better. But I knew there was a risk that he didn't happen. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=226.0s)]
*  But I had to take a chance. So what was the hold up with the UFC like what what what led you to not sign. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=232.0s)]
*  There was a lot of frustration over the years. I think since my fight against Tipeh my first fight against Tipeh my relation with the USA never been the same. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=242.0s)]
*  Really. Yeah. Why. In what way. I don't know. We try. I try everything. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=255.0s)]
*  I wasn't I think I wasn't in there. I feel like I wasn't in the right place. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=260.0s)]
*  And that's after that. Then I get the directly with fight was like the worst fight and that didn't help me at all. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=267.0s)]
*  You know. So I was I think from that moment I was already put in some position out there because I came back. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=277.0s)]
*  I won. I won multiple fight and they came with a new deal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=287.0s)]
*  This was after Junior dos Santos back in June 2017. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=294.0s)]
*  And then. He was a make who called for a new deal. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=299.0s)]
*  And then until my team was on the way to the negotiation who was in Anaheim when Tipeh and DC was fighting the second time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=308.0s)]
*  And then down like no they say no no new deal for Francis. He has he has to have three fight on his contract. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=319.0s)]
*  And to be honest I was even happy because I wanted to knock that out. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=326.0s)]
*  By that time I understood a little bit about the market. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=330.0s)]
*  I just wanted to find out my contract and renegotiate as free. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=334.0s)]
*  You know. But then. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=341.0s)]
*  A month after we get a call from I think was Hunter or somebody there. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=346.0s)]
*  Yeah. They say oh yeah let's negotiate. Let's talk about a new deal for Francis. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=352.0s)]
*  And at that time like there is not a new deal. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=357.0s)]
*  Well like we just want a fight. You know it's already September or. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=361.0s)]
*  Yeah. We are in September and my last fight was in June. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=367.0s)]
*  I want to fight. You know so the new deal staff be holding me back. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=373.0s)]
*  They didn't give me a fight. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=379.0s)]
*  Because they wanted you to sign a new deal. They wanted me to fight. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=381.0s)]
*  You didn't want to sign a new deal. You wanted to fight your contract down. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=384.0s)]
*  I want to fight my contract down. So they were slowing things down. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=386.0s)]
*  They were slowing things down. So that if you see like the interval between my junior dosentos fight and J.J. Rosenstrow fight was almost a year. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=390.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=400.0s)]
*  It's also COVID right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=401.0s)]
*  Yeah. There was a COVID in between but without COVID he would have stayed there like 10 months. Right. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=402.0s)]
*  And then from junior from Rosenstrow to Stipe same thing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=407.0s)]
*  Then Stipe to Syringan almost the same thing. He was mostly about the contract. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=413.0s)]
*  So then finally you fight out the contract and then what happens? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=419.0s)]
*  We didn't come to an agreement at all because during this time there was still a negotiation pushing and stuff. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=425.0s)]
*  And I wanted to fight out that contract proposal of money. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=433.0s)]
*  Obviously they know my position because I was pressure financially. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=437.0s)]
*  You know when you have a fight you expect to fight at least at that level. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=442.0s)]
*  At that moment I was expecting to fight at least two or three times a year. Right. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=447.0s)]
*  Then I get to the point that I have one fight. I have nothing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=452.0s)]
*  So I was limited of income stuff like that. Then I started borrowing money. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=456.0s)]
*  Even before the Stipe fight when they announced that fight I need to call to ask for the advance of my purse to finance my training camp. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=464.0s)]
*  I have no money. But I was there training and getting ready for almost a year. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=473.0s)]
*  So I took some advance. That's got to be very stressful. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=481.0s)]
*  Yeah. But one thing and that's like one thing that I'm always grateful about my life. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=485.0s)]
*  I used to this situation and I told myself like these people they don't know me. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=492.0s)]
*  I can live out of nothing. I live in the street bro. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=497.0s)]
*  And then I'm here in Las Vegas you think like okay I don't fight. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=502.0s)]
*  I just have to change everything. I'm able to live out of the bare minimum. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=507.0s)]
*  And I don't care if I walk around you guys say Ho Ho Champ, Ho Ho That's a UFC contender whatever it is. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=513.0s)]
*  Man I just live based off what is in my base of my asset. I don't live beyond that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=520.0s)]
*  That's why I like I don't really trust those credit card system or those loans and stuff. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=527.0s)]
*  That's America shit bro. I don't trust that because when it lets you down it lets you down. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=534.0s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=541.0s)]
*  I check my wallet whatever is in my wallet I live based on that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=542.0s)]
*  I don't go loan and stuff unless like I'm forced at some point or it's an investment like having taken the money, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=548.0s)]
*  borrowing money for your training camp you know. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=557.0s)]
*  That's a different thing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=560.0s)]
*  So you win the zero gun fight then what happens? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=562.0s)]
*  Well then first then I didn't come to the ring to the octagon for the belt. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=567.0s)]
*  Yeah and then after that they get this dinner invite us to this dinner trying to smooth things out. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=575.0s)]
*  Again the condition at that time I think at that time for me he was more than a contract. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=585.0s)]
*  He was like a lot of frustration from the past almost three years you know. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=592.0s)]
*  I'm like okay I have no guarantee that signing this contract I will not get into what I was I have been to in the past three years. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=598.0s)]
*  So how about we change something that will make me feel secure. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=609.0s)]
*  And what did you want to change? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=614.0s)]
*  A lot of things. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=619.0s)]
*  I want in my contract first of all I want a contract without extension because I have seen how they can abuse of those extension. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=621.0s)]
*  Can you explain to me how the extension works? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=629.0s)]
*  Oh well I mean there's not a way that he works. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=631.0s)]
*  The extension is that because they say if you deny a fight they can extend you for six months or something. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=637.0s)]
*  If you're hurt and can't fight they can extend you for six months or something. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=647.0s)]
*  But the problem the UFC is the judge and the party they decide if they will extend you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=653.0s)]
*  You have no say. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=662.0s)]
*  So when they say oh you fight tomorrow you say no. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=663.0s)]
*  I'm like okay no problem we were just checking. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=668.0s)]
*  And then maybe a week after you will receive a letter of extension like your contract has been extended for six months. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=672.0s)]
*  And that's what happened with me. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=679.0s)]
*  Even if you're injured like say if they propose a fight for you like here we are in September. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=681.0s)]
*  If they propose a fight for you in Madison Square Garden in November and you say I can't because I'm injured. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=686.0s)]
*  Oh no that extension. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=692.0s)]
*  Then they put up a six month extension on the contract. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=694.0s)]
*  That's extension. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=696.0s)]
*  Anytime you refuse a fight is that what it is? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=698.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=700.0s)]
*  And refuse is subjective. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=702.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=705.0s)]
*  It could mean you can't fight because you're injured like when you tore your knee ligaments. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=706.0s)]
*  Oh no that is an extension. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=711.0s)]
*  Extension. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=713.0s)]
*  Yeah that's clearly an extension. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=714.0s)]
*  For example my extension for example the first one when I get when I first TPE right. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=716.0s)]
*  And I have been fighting almost once a year in the past three years. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=722.0s)]
*  I first TPE on March 27 and then April 2nd Mick is calling my team. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=727.0s)]
*  And I tell them like oh I want to fight stay active. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=736.0s)]
*  I want to fight twice this year again. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=740.0s)]
*  Summer which is July or August and December. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=742.0s)]
*  And then April 2nd they are calling to ask me to fight and I was getting ready. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=746.0s)]
*  It was a big moment in my life. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=753.0s)]
*  I'm like I'm bringing this trophy home. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=755.0s)]
*  This trophy home right. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=757.0s)]
*  You're a champ now. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=759.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=760.0s)]
*  And they called to ask me if I can fight in June 12. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=761.0s)]
*  It was June 12. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=765.0s)]
*  June 6 or something like that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=767.0s)]
*  I'm like bro give me a time. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=770.0s)]
*  I mean they say no we were just offering in case because Francis said he want to fight twice this year. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=773.0s)]
*  I'm like yes I do. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=780.0s)]
*  And I said July the earliest and August and December. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=782.0s)]
*  And I know that I can take one two weeks two three weeks out maybe go home do stuff and come back. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=788.0s)]
*  And I'm like no no no totally understandable. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=798.0s)]
*  He was just to check in case it worked for you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=802.0s)]
*  It wasn't really. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=808.0s)]
*  Couple months after I received an extension about that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=810.0s)]
*  But you know why because my contract originally supposed to end in May 20th of that year. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=814.0s)]
*  So if my contract and on May 20th at that year that means the championship close kicks in which is one year. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=825.0s)]
*  But if they extend me I have to go all the way to the extension before the championship close kicks in. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=835.0s)]
*  So it was more time. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=844.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=846.0s)]
*  So when they say no it's OK. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=848.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=851.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=852.0s)]
*  We were just checking. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=853.0s)]
*  And I was in Cameroon in on May 19th. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=855.0s)]
*  So one day before my original contract which was 14 months expired and then the championship kick in I received an extension. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=860.0s)]
*  I was in Cameroon suffering of covid at that time. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=870.0s)]
*  So I received an extension letter. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=874.0s)]
*  So now I'm extended until November 20th. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=878.0s)]
*  Even though you told them you wanted to fight in July. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=882.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=885.0s)]
*  So they just tack on. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=887.0s)]
*  No they just tacked on and you have nothing to say. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=889.0s)]
*  It's effective from the moment that they send that letter out. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=892.0s)]
*  OK so your new contract you wanted no extensions. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=894.0s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=897.0s)]
*  Yeah that's one thing. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=898.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=899.0s)]
*  What was it was one of them the ability to box. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=900.0s)]
*  One of them was the ability to box. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=903.0s)]
*  They say that wasn't an option. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=906.0s)]
*  Boxing is dead. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=909.0s)]
*  It's not possible. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=910.0s)]
*  This and that. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=911.0s)]
*  Now what does that feel like to you knowing that Conor McGregor did it and fought Floyd Mayweather and made one hundred million dollars. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=912.0s)]
*  What is that like for you to be sitting there being told that you can't box. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=919.0s)]
*  Well I don't used to. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=925.0s)]
*  I don't used to take what people tell me for an answer. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=930.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=935.0s)]
*  I used to do my own thing. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=936.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=939.0s)]
*  On my own way. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=940.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=941.0s)]
*  And it seems to work pretty good. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=942.0s)]
*  But I wasn't going to force to change everything. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=945.0s)]
*  I wasn't expecting to go there and demand this demand that and just have everything. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=948.0s)]
*  You know it's like it's a big company. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=953.0s)]
*  It's like an institution. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=955.0s)]
*  You know so there is a way that they do things. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=957.0s)]
*  And that can change. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=960.0s)]
*  So I'm like OK if that's if so let's take boxing out. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=962.0s)]
*  Why. Because give me three fights. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=968.0s)]
*  Contra of three fight. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=971.0s)]
*  I was I knew that I can knock it three fight contract in a year. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=972.0s)]
*  Then from that moment I was free because I want I want a middle ground like an alternative a way to get out by giving something out. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=977.0s)]
*  You know to get something at the end. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=986.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=989.0s)]
*  You know because it's really hard to get in a negotiation and just like oh I want this I want that and one that and stop there. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=990.0s)]
*  At some point you have to compromise to push back. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=998.0s)]
*  Give something in order to get something. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1001.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1004.0s)]
*  So stuff like that was the thing that I was about it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1005.0s)]
*  And that seems to be attractive to them. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1010.0s)]
*  You know one three fight deal no extension that seems to be attractive to fight was supposed to be potentially jungeons fight and rematch and one fight is the trilogy with stupid. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1016.0s)]
*  That was the request. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1030.0s)]
*  And work for both party. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1032.0s)]
*  Then we get to. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1036.0s)]
*  We get to another point sponsorship deal. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1041.0s)]
*  Why sponsorship deal because before that I had a deal after the stupid fight I had a deal on the table for over a million dollar for cryptocurrency wallet. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1044.0s)]
*  So I was going to have like I think one point two million which is the money that I didn't I never have in the fight. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1058.0s)]
*  I was going to have that in a sponsorship and the deal was this close to sign. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1068.0s)]
*  And then they announced the crypto that come to you and then the party pull off from like a bro we can do you understand our position. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1073.0s)]
*  You can be carried this in the octagon why behind we are trying to push you know. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1082.0s)]
*  Did you try to make a deal with crypto dot com. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1090.0s)]
*  No no creep at that moment crypto dot com they don't care. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1094.0s)]
*  Because they have a deal with you. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1098.0s)]
*  They have to deal with the UFC and you're going to wear it whether you like it or not. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1099.0s)]
*  You don't have a say. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1103.0s)]
*  And I'm like I think this is messed up. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1105.0s)]
*  I need we need to solve this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1108.0s)]
*  I need a sponsorship. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1110.0s)]
*  I need a right to have my own sponsor. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1111.0s)]
*  We should fight should be able to have two three sponsorship on their on their gears. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1117.0s)]
*  I mean I understand that we want to make this ball grow make it nice. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1124.0s)]
*  But we can we can also mean wise you can have a department who check all the sponsor like oh no this is not good because of this reason. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1129.0s)]
*  It doesn't represent this poor well right. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1139.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1142.0s)]
*  But there are a lot of good stuff out there that will also help fighter to you know to provide to get a little more money. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1143.0s)]
*  And that was another discussion. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1152.0s)]
*  I'm like oh can do that. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1155.0s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1158.0s)]
*  So what is working exactly. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1160.0s)]
*  They make me some kind of like a proposal which I don't know what doesn't even make sense. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1163.0s)]
*  But and the other one was like because of the fact that I was in this position for so long and I was just so powerless. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1170.0s)]
*  The reason why I stay in this position where I keep holding my ground was big only because in the contract days what they call the sunset close. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1184.0s)]
*  So meaning like after five years from the beginning from the day you signed a contract doesn't matter what is in the contract a contract expire. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1195.0s)]
*  The extension they can extend you pass that date. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1207.0s)]
*  So my end goal from the beginning from the moment that I know that OK I can hold his ground. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1211.0s)]
*  I know that I have to face some obstacle. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1218.0s)]
*  So my end goal was the five years the sunset. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1222.0s)]
*  I had the sunset date date in my mind December 9th 2022. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1225.0s)]
*  I had that day in my mind for like almost three years. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1232.0s)]
*  So when I was receiving all this extension letter I mean I couldn't fight it either way. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1235.0s)]
*  But in my mind I was just like it's OK. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1241.0s)]
*  One thing that I know I just just focus on December 9th 2022. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1245.0s)]
*  And then you will be fine. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1250.0s)]
*  So after that then I'm like OK if I sign a new deal I don't know even if there is not extension. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1253.0s)]
*  There have been a proof of like how could I say in a nice way abuse of power. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1263.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1270.0s)]
*  But why are we in this position. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1272.0s)]
*  This is the position that every fighter get into. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1278.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1282.0s)]
*  I mean be feeling powerless. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1283.0s)]
*  We might be many hundreds of us but it's every individual at time. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1285.0s)]
*  We are very separated. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1291.0s)]
*  Every case is separated. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1293.0s)]
*  So which mean you're just weak. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1295.0s)]
*  It's just you against big monster which is the company the institution. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1299.0s)]
*  So you can't fight. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1304.0s)]
*  How can we make it make sense. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1305.0s)]
*  I mean we are not going for union but at least you guys sometime before make some decision. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1308.0s)]
*  How about you have somebody in the room who can understand things from our perspective. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1316.0s)]
*  Because I do believe that all the position decision that you might make will hurt us is not meant to hurt. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1322.0s)]
*  But maybe just because you don't understand our position. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1331.0s)]
*  Maybe if somebody they're speaking for us which again I don't know who he could be but just be mindful that OK this is fighter position. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1334.0s)]
*  Maybe that will help. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1346.0s)]
*  So you get through all this and then where did it break down to the point where you had to walk away. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1349.0s)]
*  He break down December 6 I think was December no December 20. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1356.0s)]
*  I don't remember 19 or 22nd something like that. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1366.0s)]
*  I had a dinner with Hunter after we've been going through stuff. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1371.0s)]
*  He said no to this no to that. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1375.0s)]
*  You know but I have a focus. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1378.0s)]
*  I know that OK. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1381.0s)]
*  If I give three fight here since they are willing to take the three fight is going to make you know I don't want to break this relationship like this. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1383.0s)]
*  I don't want it to be a war. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1395.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1397.0s)]
*  I can't stand. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1398.0s)]
*  I can't stand in this. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1401.0s)]
*  But so we can get trying to fix things up. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1403.0s)]
*  But when we met again that day was the first time over all this time that we have to talk about the financial aspect. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1409.0s)]
*  I mean he has to propose a financial aspect right. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1419.0s)]
*  So he proposed it at dinner. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1423.0s)]
*  He proposed a dinner and then I just like this guy is making fun of me. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1424.0s)]
*  Make it funny. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1431.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1432.0s)]
*  So it was disrespectful. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1433.0s)]
*  It was like not valuable enough for you. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1435.0s)]
*  No I don't. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1438.0s)]
*  And you're the champ at the time. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1440.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean not at all. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1442.0s)]
*  Like when you're talking about pay per view then you're negotiating pay per view and then you see number like one point two five pay by and stuff like that. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1445.0s)]
*  And the pay per view is going from six from 60 to 80 dollar in the past five years. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1457.0s)]
*  And you realize that the two one the two there is zero point two five that is on top of it is just out of the twenty dollar that been added on. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1465.0s)]
*  And like come on man. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1478.0s)]
*  It's not my first pay per view contract. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1480.0s)]
*  This wasn't enough money. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1486.0s)]
*  Wasn't even about the money. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1488.0s)]
*  Even how it was structured even how it was. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1491.0s)]
*  I'm like this doesn't make sense. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1494.0s)]
*  You know I went home and I was so I don't know frustrated or disappointed. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1498.0s)]
*  I don't know how I can describe. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1506.0s)]
*  But one thing I know I went online like I'm missing Christmas with my family. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1509.0s)]
*  I'm here training for a potential to join Jones fight which might not happen. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1514.0s)]
*  What for? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1520.0s)]
*  Seems like we are not getting anywhere close. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1521.0s)]
*  I booked a flight that night to go to Cameroon and I was in Cameroon in the Christmas and then couple days after I received a text from Mick. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1524.0s)]
*  Mick Mena was you know Mick usually sometimes just send me a friendly text to check on me. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1535.0s)]
*  And then we talked a little bit and then he talked about the contract. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1543.0s)]
*  Like he heard that we didn't come to a term. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1550.0s)]
*  I say yes. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1554.0s)]
*  Say like is it anything that I can do. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1556.0s)]
*  I'm like I don't think so. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1558.0s)]
*  We didn't just have an agreement and said how about we talk again. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1561.0s)]
*  Let's get in the meeting with Hunter again and talk. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1572.0s)]
*  And as I said Mick always be nice and I couldn't say no. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1577.0s)]
*  I'm like yes let's try. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1583.0s)]
*  In fact I wish it could have worked. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1585.0s)]
*  Because to be honest I never like really before all this I never imagined a life out of the UFC. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1589.0s)]
*  I thought it would be like my filing platform on to my retirement or something. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1597.0s)]
*  But clearly things has changed along the way. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1603.0s)]
*  So even when they came back a second time it still was not enough. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1608.0s)]
*  Yeah because when they came back and all this time that we've been talking they've been talking about the what is the term back pay. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1614.0s)]
*  Yeah we're going to back pay you. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1629.0s)]
*  Because from all the fight that I've been refusing to renegotiate the pay that they were proposing they say they're going to back pay me that. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1633.0s)]
*  When they come out now and then make pay better and I'm like okay the back pay and this and that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1643.0s)]
*  I'm like no no everything is new contract. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1653.0s)]
*  This is it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1655.0s)]
*  Then I'm like okay well then I don't know what to say if you say this is it because you're against your word. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1657.0s)]
*  You say something and now you say this is it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1666.0s)]
*  I said I don't have the back pay bro. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1669.0s)]
*  So they proposed the back pay and then they took it away. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1671.0s)]
*  Yeah they've been proposing the back pay before. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1675.0s)]
*  After the serious fight they get the invite us to a dinner and then keep reminding me how they're going to back pay me. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1679.0s)]
*  Everything because I have a good proposal at the time but I know that proposal and he was a good money but I know he was just a bay to sign a contract. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1690.0s)]
*  He was just to put the pen on the paper. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1702.0s)]
*  It wasn't really like a good fee like what I do want to make give me a good contract. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1705.0s)]
*  And they get to the point that they're like no everything is in this. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1711.0s)]
*  I'm like okay I don't see it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1717.0s)]
*  And I was we were kind of like silence for a couple of seconds like what's that mean? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1721.0s)]
*  Like you know then we hang up. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1729.0s)]
*  So at that point do you start to talk to people like the PFL and NFC and no no. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1734.0s)]
*  At that point I stopped. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1741.0s)]
*  I didn't do anything when we stopped that conversation. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1743.0s)]
*  I didn't do anything until like I started to see all this thing on social media. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1746.0s)]
*  And then I saw the dinner press conference like oh we get rid of Francis. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1753.0s)]
*  Yes he's not getting any younger. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1761.0s)]
*  He's injured. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1764.0s)]
*  I'm like yes he's not getting any younger but you were trying to have him. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1765.0s)]
*  He's injured but you were trying to have him. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1770.0s)]
*  Now you didn't come to an agreement. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1772.0s)]
*  You're bashing him. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1776.0s)]
*  That's when I started to respond because I never really like want this like to be something on me. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1778.0s)]
*  And I was expecting like maybe they go out there and just say oh unfortunately we didn't come to agreement and this and that. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1785.0s)]
*  And thank you. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1793.0s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1794.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1795.0s)]
*  And then we we move away. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1796.0s)]
*  But that's not how they do things over there. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1799.0s)]
*  So you decide to start talking to other people that. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1803.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1807.0s)]
*  And who do you talk to first. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1808.0s)]
*  People started to reach out. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1812.0s)]
*  I wasn't even the one talking to people. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1814.0s)]
*  And you know at that time I just want to let this weight drop out of my shoulder. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1817.0s)]
*  For some reason I feel relieved. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1824.0s)]
*  I feel relieved. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1827.0s)]
*  There was so much pressure into that process. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1828.0s)]
*  And I was in Cameroon. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1832.0s)]
*  I'm like man just live your life you know. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1834.0s)]
*  Whatever is yours out there will come to you. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1837.0s)]
*  But I get the first person that reached out was Pete Murray from PFL. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1841.0s)]
*  And then I was just like yes let's hear him out. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1851.0s)]
*  And he came out. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1857.0s)]
*  We speak. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1859.0s)]
*  He asked like what I'm looking for and stuff. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1860.0s)]
*  We speak and we're like ah looks good. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1863.0s)]
*  Couple days after he made a proposal. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1866.0s)]
*  I look I mean I didn't even ask for not anything. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1870.0s)]
*  But when he make a proposal I look at the structure of that proposal. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1874.0s)]
*  I'm like this is good. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1878.0s)]
*  You know everything was being taken into consideration. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1881.0s)]
*  You know obviously there is always. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1885.0s)]
*  There is always going to be a way to negotiate in a contract. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1889.0s)]
*  But the way that they structured it I was already happy. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1894.0s)]
*  I'm like I think this guy is trying to make me happy. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1897.0s)]
*  Yeah well they need someone like you. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1903.0s)]
*  PFL doesn't really have the big stars. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1905.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1908.0s)]
*  So but we keep that contract and at that time I'm like let's wait. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1909.0s)]
*  I'm not rushing to anything. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1914.0s)]
*  It takes some time and everything. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1916.0s)]
*  And then. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1919.0s)]
*  So you didn't sign that yet. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1920.0s)]
*  No I didn't sign. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1921.0s)]
*  We also get to a chartering. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1922.0s)]
*  Even chartering reach out. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1925.0s)]
*  We talk same thing. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1927.0s)]
*  And then couple days they send their own contract. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1929.0s)]
*  But when I was putting that contract next to the PFL one it was day and night. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1935.0s)]
*  The PFL was much better. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1944.0s)]
*  And the PFL put a clause in to allow you to box. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1945.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1949.0s)]
*  No boxing was was first to me. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1950.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1953.0s)]
*  Would the PFL be involved in the boxing promotion. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1954.0s)]
*  That was up to me. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1956.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1957.0s)]
*  That was up to me. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1958.0s)]
*  But they didn't really like want to. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1959.0s)]
*  It's not their expertise. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1961.0s)]
*  But if they can help in some way or be involved in some way. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1962.0s)]
*  Again it's up to me. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1967.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1969.0s)]
*  So very independent contract. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1970.0s)]
*  So. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1974.0s)]
*  But I was more looking about like boxing. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1975.0s)]
*  That's the first time that I have to. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1980.0s)]
*  I started to have dialogue about boxing and stuff. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1983.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1987.0s)]
*  And I know there was some conversations with you fighting. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1988.0s)]
*  There was Deontay Wilder they talked about. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1991.0s)]
*  I think they talked about Dillion White. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1993.0s)]
*  He was. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1995.0s)]
*  He was Deontay Wilder. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1996.0s)]
*  Deontay Wilder. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1998.0s)]
*  We definitely we had a conversation with Deontay Wilder team even with him. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=1999.0s)]
*  I personally like was under of meeting with him. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2005.0s)]
*  Conference with him that we were talking about a potential to fight there. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2011.0s)]
*  So and that's what that was going well. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2017.0s)]
*  And I think even to this day we we are kind of like open about it. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2020.0s)]
*  Because along the way he has the he has a potential opportunity right away that they say OK. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2027.0s)]
*  We had like to pursue the conversation about what we have here. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2034.0s)]
*  And he was for us he was understandable. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2040.0s)]
*  We're like OK. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2044.0s)]
*  Then let's explore. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2045.0s)]
*  Maybe after. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2047.0s)]
*  And then right after that I have my own. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2048.0s)]
*  I started a conversation with the. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2052.0s)]
*  With the. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2055.0s)]
*  For the fury fight. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2057.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2060.0s)]
*  Because I get a call. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2062.0s)]
*  I was I was driving to. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2063.0s)]
*  Yeah I was driving to the airport and I get a call to meet in New York for for some conversation about the fury fight. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2066.0s)]
*  And then when I get in New York. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2075.0s)]
*  Next week we scheduled out on next week I get in New York. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2079.0s)]
*  We get to the room. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2083.0s)]
*  I meet the people. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2085.0s)]
*  He was the right people. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2086.0s)]
*  We spoke. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2088.0s)]
*  I heard that I hear them out. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2089.0s)]
*  And I'm like. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2091.0s)]
*  I knew them right. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2093.0s)]
*  And I'm like OK. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2095.0s)]
*  This is legit. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2096.0s)]
*  I think with these people behind this fight is going to happen. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2098.0s)]
*  That's where I. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2102.0s)]
*  Now put them in contact with my team to negotiate because they wanted me to everything. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2104.0s)]
*  Let's negotiate this. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2111.0s)]
*  I'm like I don't do negotiation. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2113.0s)]
*  I listen. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2117.0s)]
*  I talk about like how I would like things to go. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2118.0s)]
*  But I don't like to negotiate personally. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2122.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2127.0s)]
*  I want these. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2128.0s)]
*  I deserve these. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2129.0s)]
*  I'm that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2130.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2131.0s)]
*  I want somebody to have somebody do that on my behalf. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2132.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2135.0s)]
*  Somebody do that on your behalf and you want to respond to a good deal. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2136.0s)]
*  A good deal brought to you. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2140.0s)]
*  I want somebody. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2141.0s)]
*  It's always good to have somebody in the middle that would take the temper of both party. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2142.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2147.0s)]
*  Because they do can fall off just because somebody's mad. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2148.0s)]
*  And these name like his ego take over and the days off. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2152.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2157.0s)]
*  And you want somebody in between and you always come to like OK. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2158.0s)]
*  It's not him. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2163.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2165.0s)]
*  And just to think about it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2166.0s)]
*  And that's what happened because sometime with my team there was that there was frustrated. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2167.0s)]
*  And I'm like oh no this is not working. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2174.0s)]
*  And then they will come to you. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2176.0s)]
*  Then you will talk nice. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2178.0s)]
*  You know be a nice cup. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2180.0s)]
*  I have no problem. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2181.0s)]
*  I'm like no. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2182.0s)]
*  But my team is saying this because they didn't mean to offend you. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2183.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2187.0s)]
*  But I think you know. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2188.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2190.0s)]
*  Frustrating right. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2191.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2192.0s)]
*  I mean no frustrating. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2193.0s)]
*  I mean. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2194.0s)]
*  Complicated. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2196.0s)]
*  But over the time you learn you understand how it works and it's pretty easy. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2197.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2200.0s)]
*  It's pretty easy. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2201.0s)]
*  So you're in the driver's seat now because you've left the UFC. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2202.0s)]
*  You have all these opportunities on the table possibly Deontay Wilder. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2206.0s)]
*  Then it becomes Tyson Fury. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2210.0s)]
*  So when do you know that that fight is actually going to take place because I know there was a lot. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2212.0s)]
*  June. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2217.0s)]
*  June. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2218.0s)]
*  June. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2219.0s)]
*  That was in June. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2220.0s)]
*  That was in June. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2221.0s)]
*  We locked that fight. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2222.0s)]
*  It was concluded. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2223.0s)]
*  Everything was set. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2224.0s)]
*  So for all those months from December to June you're essentially just trying to find where you're going to land. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2231.0s)]
*  But before that I have. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2232.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2234.0s)]
*  The deal with the PFL. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2235.0s)]
*  I think it was in. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2237.0s)]
*  In March. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2240.0s)]
*  But I made the request. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2241.0s)]
*  I say let's just figure out what would be next. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2243.0s)]
*  My next boxing fight before we signed a deal. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2247.0s)]
*  So you haven't signed the deal with the PFL. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2251.0s)]
*  I haven't signed a deal. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2252.0s)]
*  Is it possible. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2253.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2254.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2255.0s)]
*  Is it possible that you go and fight Tyson Fury and then the UFC comes back to you and says listen let's make this right and let's fight John Jones. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2256.0s)]
*  Is that possible. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2265.0s)]
*  It's possible but. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2266.0s)]
*  No it's possible. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2268.0s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2269.0s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2270.0s)]
*  But they have to go to the PFL now. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2271.0s)]
*  Oh because the PFL of a contract signed. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2275.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2277.0s)]
*  You did sign a contract. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2278.0s)]
*  I did sign. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2279.0s)]
*  I say in March I was it wasn't signed. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2280.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2282.0s)]
*  I signed in May. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2283.0s)]
*  Do you think the PFL would allow that. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2284.0s)]
*  Oh the PFL is down for that. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2287.0s)]
*  Really. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2289.0s)]
*  Yeah it's down for that. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2290.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2291.0s)]
*  The PFL is down for that. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2293.0s)]
*  The PFL would let you fight in the UFC. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2295.0s)]
*  But what happens if you beat John Jones you become the UFC heavyweight champion again. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2298.0s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2305.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2307.0s)]
*  Maybe he'll be a special fighter special bird or something. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2310.0s)]
*  Maybe not like a UFC bird. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2314.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2316.0s)]
*  Yeah the UFC probably would not be down for that. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2317.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2319.0s)]
*  Win the title and then go fight in the PFL. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2320.0s)]
*  No no not the title. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2322.0s)]
*  But you know to be honest I don't worry about the title. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2324.0s)]
*  The title is not what I worry about. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2328.0s)]
*  I worry about that fight that challenge. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2330.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2332.0s)]
*  And I wouldn't care if it was a fight without a title. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2333.0s)]
*  You know so. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2338.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2339.0s)]
*  In my I don't need a UFC title. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2340.0s)]
*  Especially with that fight. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2343.0s)]
*  What difference does it make. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2345.0s)]
*  It's John Jones and you. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2346.0s)]
*  No that fight is bigger than a title. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2347.0s)]
*  Yes bigger than a title. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2349.0s)]
*  The fight is bigger than a title. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2350.0s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2351.0s)]
*  So deep inside me I still have a little bit of hope even though I know. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2352.0s)]
*  It's going to be hard but you never know. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2359.0s)]
*  Boy that would be a big gamble for them because if you win then you're the champ but you're [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2363.0s)]
*  signed with the PFL. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2367.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2368.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2369.0s)]
*  OK so. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2371.0s)]
*  So June you get the Tyson Fury bout negotiated. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2372.0s)]
*  Did you get everything you want. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2375.0s)]
*  Was it easy. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2377.0s)]
*  Again you don't walk in a room for a contract to get everything that you want. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2379.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2384.0s)]
*  And at that moment I was just so happy happy to get that fight happen because from that [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2385.0s)]
*  fight a lot of things will be open. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2390.0s)]
*  That fight would open a lot of doubt. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2394.0s)]
*  You know sometimes even in the negotiation sometimes you have to see long term like what [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2397.0s)]
*  it comes with. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2405.0s)]
*  Now I get this fight. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2407.0s)]
*  I think it should have been the focus. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2408.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2414.0s)]
*  After this fight imagine hypothetically I go out there and knock Tyson Fury out. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2415.0s)]
*  What do you think will happen for me. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2420.0s)]
*  Where does that leave me. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2423.0s)]
*  If you knock Tyson Fury out you're the biggest combat sports star in the world. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2424.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2429.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2430.0s)]
*  So is that everything that you want. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2431.0s)]
*  You want the cash. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2433.0s)]
*  You get everything. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2435.0s)]
*  Well if you knock Tyson Fury out the real money is in a rematch. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2438.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2442.0s)]
*  That's the real money. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2443.0s)]
*  That's crazy money. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2444.0s)]
*  Are they giving you crazy money for the Tyson Fury fight. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2447.0s)]
*  Yeah they're giving me a good money and very great condition. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2453.0s)]
*  I like a lot of component and again I like a lot of component of this contract who was [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2459.0s)]
*  like the thing the treatment that they were giving me. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2467.0s)]
*  The access how easy to make stuff for me. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2473.0s)]
*  You know like it's going to be the first time that my family going to attend to my fight [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2475.0s)]
*  and I don't even have to think about it. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2480.0s)]
*  They're going to work on it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2482.0s)]
*  They're going to figure out how to bring my mom my sister my brother out to Saudi to watch [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2483.0s)]
*  that fight. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2489.0s)]
*  OK so they're going to take care of everything. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2490.0s)]
*  They're going to take care. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2491.0s)]
*  And I think Saudis know how to throw that money around. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2492.0s)]
*  And I think that's that's that's something that for me was very very important. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2494.0s)]
*  I think you know I could have have more money but he wouldn't make me more happier than [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2500.0s)]
*  stuff like that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2507.0s)]
*  And you know you kind of like work with people that you feel like OK they are trying their [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2508.0s)]
*  best they are very best to make you feel comfortable feel happy. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2516.0s)]
*  I think that is also it's also a partnership. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2520.0s)]
*  You know it's not like one shot. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2524.0s)]
*  OK take everything that I can take and go. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2526.0s)]
*  How can we build something like is it like somebody that I can trust. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2528.0s)]
*  Can we build something for the future. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2533.0s)]
*  And then when you feel like yes you invest into that relationship. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2535.0s)]
*  OK so June they negotiate the fight. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2540.0s)]
*  Is it 12 rounds 10 rounds 10 rounds 10 rounds and they've created a new belt. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2545.0s)]
*  And you're happy with the money. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2551.0s)]
*  You're happy with the conditions. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2554.0s)]
*  You're happy with everything. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2555.0s)]
*  So then in June is when you go hardcore boxing training. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2557.0s)]
*  Like when did you start like hardcore boxing training. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2561.0s)]
*  I was training boxing already. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2564.0s)]
*  No no like I was in a camp. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2567.0s)]
*  But you're recovering from your knee surgery first of all. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2570.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2572.0s)]
*  So you can't kick you can't wrestle. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2573.0s)]
*  I can kick I can wrestle. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2576.0s)]
*  I mean I have to be careful. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2578.0s)]
*  I have to be careful. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2580.0s)]

*  And what a vehicle it is. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2645.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2646.0s)]
*  Basically when you're going to put it in a big crash like this. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2647.0s)]
*  So. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2650.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2651.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2652.0s)]
*  That's a good way to put it. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2653.0s)]
*  Because Tyson Fury is a monster. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2655.0s)]
*  I stand next to him. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2657.0s)]
*  I'm like damn this guy is big. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2659.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2661.0s)]
*  I'm like you really need to go full force. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2662.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2665.0s)]
*  He's a big fellow. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2666.0s)]
*  And he's very good. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2667.0s)]
*  Very skillful. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2668.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2669.0s)]
*  You jump into the top of the heap. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2670.0s)]
*  Maybe ever. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2671.0s)]
*  I was there at the press conference next to him. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2672.0s)]
*  And I'm like yes look my fat belly. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2674.0s)]
*  I'm a fat pig. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2676.0s)]
*  I'm this. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2678.0s)]
*  I'm like don't you fool me. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2679.0s)]
*  I have seen you. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2681.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2682.0s)]
*  He tricks people with that belly. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2683.0s)]
*  I'm like don't you fool me. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2685.0s)]
*  Don't you trick me Tyson. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2686.0s)]
*  I have seen you box. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2687.0s)]
*  And you doesn't box as if fat anything at all. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2689.0s)]
*  No he doesn't. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2693.0s)]
*  No he doesn't. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2695.0s)]
*  He's an animal. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2696.0s)]
*  Because if you just focus on his body then you'll be like oh I think easy job. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2697.0s)]
*  No man. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2701.0s)]
*  When the guy is in the ring moving you I'm like okay is it like something that they are [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2702.0s)]
*  remoting or something. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2706.0s)]
*  I'm like no don't you fool me. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2707.0s)]
*  He's very very skillful. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2710.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2712.0s)]
*  Very skillful. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2713.0s)]
*  But you know you have probably the most sensational punching power I've ever seen in the heavyweight [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2714.0s)]
*  division in the UFC. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2720.0s)]
*  It's you and Derrick Lewis. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2722.0s)]
*  You're the two biggest knockout artists ever. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2724.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2726.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2727.0s)]
*  But again I think in the heavyweight division everybody can knock everybody out. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2728.0s)]
*  The problem is to connect. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2733.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2736.0s)]
*  That's the most problem. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2737.0s)]
*  When you walk everybody hit somebody in the shin. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2739.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2742.0s)]
*  It's going down. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2743.0s)]
*  But can you connect. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2744.0s)]
*  How to connect. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2745.0s)]
*  The delivery system. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2746.0s)]
*  And it's something that I heard once from Teddy Atlas and it's taken my mind like the [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2747.0s)]
*  delivery system. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2755.0s)]
*  You can have the biggest missile but if you can't hit your target. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2756.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2763.0s)]
*  It's useless. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2764.0s)]
*  So when do you get involved with Mike Tyson. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2765.0s)]
*  When did that start happening. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2768.0s)]
*  In training. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2770.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2772.0s)]
*  Because I've seen videos of you training with Tyson. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2773.0s)]
*  How much have you trained with him. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2775.0s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2777.0s)]
*  He comes time to time. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2778.0s)]
*  Not always. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2779.0s)]
*  He's not always with me. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2780.0s)]
*  But if you look like four years ago. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2781.0s)]
*  Exactly four years ago. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2784.0s)]
*  And that's when Tyson and I we started to hit each other on social media. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2786.0s)]
*  And four years ago was the first time that I met Mike Tyson. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2792.0s)]
*  I was on his podcast. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2796.0s)]
*  The Hot Boxing. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2797.0s)]
*  And one request that I initiated at that time was like whenever I fight Tyson Fury would [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2799.0s)]
*  you be in my corner. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2806.0s)]
*  And he said yes. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2808.0s)]
*  That's even on my Instagram. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2809.0s)]
*  It's still on my Instagram. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2811.0s)]
*  Like the next day I put that as a caption like I asked him if he would be in my corner [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2813.0s)]
*  whenever I fight Tyson Fury. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2819.0s)]
*  And nobody believed that this could have happened. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2821.0s)]
*  Like okay cool. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2823.0s)]
*  Then what. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2825.0s)]
*  And when I get the fight I'm like bro that thing is happening. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2827.0s)]
*  That thing is manifesting itself. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2831.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2834.0s)]
*  And so Tyson agrees to be in your corner. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2836.0s)]
*  And who are you training with mostly for boxing. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2839.0s)]
*  I'm training. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2843.0s)]
*  I'm training with Dewey. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2845.0s)]
*  I also get Dewey Cooper. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2846.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2848.0s)]
*  I also get this guy from France named John Bomba that I used to work with him. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2849.0s)]
*  Work my train my boxing with him. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2857.0s)]
*  He's a young very young guy you know. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2859.0s)]
*  But I like his style the way that he his approach and stuff. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2862.0s)]
*  And I really have a good connection with him. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2867.0s)]
*  So what's up. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2870.0s)]
*  I reached out. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2872.0s)]
*  I mean even before the fight I was working with him taking me taking him in Cameroon. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2873.0s)]
*  Get some training already. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2880.0s)]
*  And then when the fight get announced I talk with him then I brought him out. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2882.0s)]
*  So he's in Vegas with me. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2886.0s)]
*  And so you started your journey in martial arts. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2889.0s)]
*  You initially wanted to be a boxer. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2893.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2895.0s)]
*  And then when you went to an MMA gym they convinced you to fight MMA. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2896.0s)]
*  When I went to France. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2899.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2900.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2901.0s)]
*  No he was even in a boxing gym that convinced me to be an MMA fighter. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2902.0s)]
*  A guy from a boxing gym named Didier Carmon. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2905.0s)]
*  The first boxing gym that I get into. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2908.0s)]
*  But he was also a martial artist himself. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2910.0s)]
*  And he said bro I think you have a very good potential. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2914.0s)]
*  I think your best outcome now regarding your situation because I was still homeless at the time. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2921.0s)]
*  I think your best outcome would be MMA. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2927.0s)]
*  If you. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2931.0s)]
*  That's I'm like what's MMA. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2932.0s)]
*  He started to explain to me like you know. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2935.0s)]
*  I'm like ah OK. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2937.0s)]
*  That's sport that they do in the cage. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2939.0s)]
*  Say yes. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2941.0s)]
*  I'm like I have seen it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2942.0s)]
*  He said if you train some take down defense and juju su what is juju su. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2944.0s)]
*  Started to explain. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2952.0s)]
*  I think you're going to be a UFC champion one day. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2954.0s)]
*  What is UFC. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2957.0s)]
*  And how old were you when this was happening. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2958.0s)]
*  Twenty seven. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2960.0s)]
*  That was in 2013. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2961.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2962.0s)]
*  June 2013. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2963.0s)]
*  People don't understand that you started this journey as an MMA fighter so late in your life. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2965.0s)]
*  Compared to most like a lot of these guys they're training when they're 14 15 years old or an MMA gyms and have an amateur fight. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2971.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2978.0s)]
*  And I forced I forced my way into MMA. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2979.0s)]
*  And that's why like there was a lot of things that I didn't understand properly. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2982.0s)]
*  I didn't learn as a athlete growing up. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2986.0s)]
*  And until I get to a stupid fight the first stupid fight man that stupid fight taught me a lot about combat sport. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2989.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2997.0s)]
*  After that fight I was at the press conference and telling people like I think I have learned more in this fight because here I've been what almost just four years four years and half since I've been doing. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=2998.0s)]
*  But not even four years and half since I've been doing MMA when I first did the first time. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3012.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3017.0s)]
*  And I said I learned this night tonight. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3018.0s)]
*  Tonight I learned more than I have learned in the past four years in this game. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3022.0s)]
*  And I think people didn't understand but I meant it. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3027.0s)]
*  Well you certainly showed it in the rematch. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3031.0s)]
*  Certainly showed it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3034.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3035.0s)]
*  And Daniel Cormier pointed it out. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3036.0s)]
*  He said patient Francis you are patient in the second fight. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3038.0s)]
*  You didn't just rush out and try to take him out the first round. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3042.0s)]
*  Much more dangerous. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3045.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3046.0s)]
*  Because my all my previous fight before Stipe I wasn't rushing rushing on anybody. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3047.0s)]
*  What about Rosenstreich? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3053.0s)]
*  He kind of rushed in. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3054.0s)]
*  That was after. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3055.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3056.0s)]
*  I mean before the first fight. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3057.0s)]
*  I wasn't rushing off on anybody. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3059.0s)]
*  I was knocking people out without rushing. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3061.0s)]
*  The mistake the thing that I did is like I get to the point that I really started to think about the knockout which is something that I never thought about it. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3064.0s)]
*  It just happened. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3072.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3073.0s)]
*  Then I started to think about it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3074.0s)]
*  So that's where I rushed. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3075.0s)]
*  You were trying to make it happen. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3077.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3078.0s)]
*  I was trying to make it happen and obviously at that time there was a lot of pressure on me and everything. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3079.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3084.0s)]
*  I was I feel like I have to give a result. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3085.0s)]
*  So that's why I was rushing. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3089.0s)]
*  So I understand that night. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3092.0s)]
*  I went back and watched that fight and I saw me fight. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3094.0s)]
*  I'm like who is that guy? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3097.0s)]
*  He just looked like me but I don't recognize why he's rushing. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3099.0s)]
*  Why is doing this? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3102.0s)]
*  So then I understand. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3104.0s)]
*  I'm like OK. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3106.0s)]
*  Maybe you just have to go back to your previous the previous way the previous you and then thing will be fine. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3108.0s)]
*  Then I went back to my in the rematch. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3115.0s)]
*  Not only were you the previous you but you were way better version of you. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3117.0s)]
*  You were very calculated very technical. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3121.0s)]
*  It was it was four years what three years after. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3124.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3128.0s)]
*  So of course I have learned I'm in the sport to learn. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3129.0s)]
*  I know that I have a deficiency. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3133.0s)]
*  So I pay a lot of attention than those people that grew up as athletes you know doing different sport. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3135.0s)]
*  I always take that very seriously. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3143.0s)]
*  The fact that I mean maybe sometime my power helped me to get away with stuff. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3147.0s)]
*  But I know that I have a deficiency you know as a as far as experience and everything even techniques. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3153.0s)]
*  Because sometimes I hear people say oh yeah he didn't train wrestling in a training camp. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3163.0s)]
*  I'm like bro come on you think two three month training wrestling in a training camp will out wrestle somebody that been wrestling his entire life. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3169.0s)]
*  No you can't. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3178.0s)]
*  You can't just find a way to go around. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3180.0s)]
*  But you know so that's how that's how I process thing. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3183.0s)]
*  I think about the advantage. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3190.0s)]
*  I always think of myself as an underdog. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3191.0s)]
*  So what did you change in your training after the first fight. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3194.0s)]
*  Did you change anything. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3198.0s)]
*  First of all I understand how to train properly. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3200.0s)]
*  I understand how to train properly. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3204.0s)]
*  And again I just think about everything as a deficiency. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3206.0s)]
*  I used to think that sometime they're like oh yes he has a good striking his box and knock people out. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3211.0s)]
*  I'm like no I have no good strike. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3218.0s)]
*  Everything has to evolve. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3220.0s)]
*  You know whether it's my striking my wrestling my jujitsu. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3224.0s)]
*  That's why people keep training. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3227.0s)]
*  The day that you think like oh I'm good at this. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3229.0s)]
*  That's the day that you start to go down because you can you can stay in the same place like this. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3232.0s)]
*  You're going to permanently try to go up. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3240.0s)]
*  And even if you are not going up. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3243.0s)]
*  That's how you can maintain your position. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3248.0s)]
*  But if you stay comfortable with something that's the day that you start to lose it. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3250.0s)]
*  So I changed everything. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3255.0s)]
*  I focus on everything like all the aspects. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3258.0s)]
*  You know that fight really helped me a lot. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3263.0s)]
*  I think about my diet. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3266.0s)]
*  I think about like the discipline stuff. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3268.0s)]
*  I mean usually I'm I'm pretty I mean I'm good with discipline. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3271.0s)]
*  But I still think about everything put everything in prospect like OK is my diet OK. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3276.0s)]
*  By the way after the steep a fight I decided to cut soda out for a couple of couple of why before and since then I never drink soda. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3283.0s)]
*  You would drink it a lot before. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3292.0s)]
*  Oh a ton. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3294.0s)]
*  Even in training camp. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3296.0s)]
*  A ton. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3298.0s)]
*  In training camp I was eating croissant everything. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3301.0s)]
*  I was like no I'm heavy weight. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3304.0s)]
*  I was just focusing about my weight and not about my condition and all those aspects. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3306.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3313.0s)]
*  You know the night before the steep a fight I was in the foco de chow eating all those things. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3314.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3321.0s)]
*  Really. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3322.0s)]
*  Yeah that's good for you. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3323.0s)]
*  Before the fight. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3324.0s)]
*  Meat. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3325.0s)]
*  Oh no it's not good at all. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3326.0s)]
*  Not good. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3327.0s)]
*  No at all. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3328.0s)]
*  I was heavy as shit. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3329.0s)]
*  Oh you ate too much. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3330.0s)]
*  Did you eat stuff with the meat like potatoes and rice. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3332.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3336.0s)]
*  Yeah that's what I'm talking about. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3337.0s)]
*  That's where it is. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3339.0s)]
*  The night before the fight a couple of like maybe two two hours or maybe one hour before working in the arena. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3340.0s)]
*  I was at foco de chow. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3348.0s)]
*  An hour before you went to the marina. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3351.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3352.0s)]
*  I went to the arena like maybe two hours before the fight but three hours is not enough. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3353.0s)]
*  To digest all the food. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3360.0s)]
*  To digest all those meats and stuff. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3361.0s)]
*  Yeah and so in that fight you learn all the lessons and then you change your diet. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3364.0s)]
*  You enhance your discipline and you keep working on all your skills. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3372.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3376.0s)]
*  Then you know how we are talking about we were talking about patience. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3377.0s)]
*  That's how I walk into the Stipe fight. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3381.0s)]
*  The Derek Lewis fight. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3383.0s)]
*  With like constantly tell myself be patient. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3385.0s)]
*  And I was there just like telling myself. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3388.0s)]
*  I think I wasn't even in that fight. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3391.0s)]
*  I was there but I was still fighting Stipe. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3393.0s)]
*  I was like no be patient. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3396.0s)]
*  Be patient. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3398.0s)]
*  You were still thinking about getting tired in that first fight. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3399.0s)]
*  Getting taken down. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3403.0s)]
*  Getting control. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3404.0s)]
*  No really. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3405.0s)]
*  I was just thinking about like patience. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3406.0s)]
*  Patience. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3408.0s)]
*  Just patience. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3409.0s)]
*  I overdo. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3410.0s)]
*  We overdo. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3411.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3412.0s)]
*  I over did it and he was too much. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3413.0s)]
*  That's how it turned out. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3415.0s)]
*  But I was like patient. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3416.0s)]
*  You get this. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3418.0s)]
*  You get this. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3419.0s)]
*  That's why at the end of the fight I'm like is it over or we still? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3420.0s)]
*  I was confused. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3425.0s)]
*  I didn't know that he was even the third round. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3427.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3430.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3431.0s)]
*  I was really messed up mentally. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3432.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3435.0s)]
*  I thought I still have it round. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3436.0s)]
*  So what was that feeling like? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3438.0s)]
*  And my corner was telling me. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3440.0s)]
*  I mean they were telling me everything is good. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3441.0s)]
*  Like okay I think you get one round. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3443.0s)]
*  The second round. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3445.0s)]
*  Maybe you get this. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3447.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3448.0s)]
*  And so I felt like everything was right. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3450.0s)]
*  So my mind was playing me really bad in that fight. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3453.0s)]
*  So what was it like when you went back and watched that fight? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3458.0s)]
*  I didn't watch. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3463.0s)]
*  You didn't watch it? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3464.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3465.0s)]
*  I feel bad. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3466.0s)]
*  I feel like I waste a bullet. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3467.0s)]
*  An important bullet. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3469.0s)]
*  That sets you back. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3471.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3474.0s)]
*  I feel very bad. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3475.0s)]
*  And then the reaction about it. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3476.0s)]
*  The way people react about it. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3479.0s)]
*  You get to the point that I kind of like tell myself like okay screw this. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3482.0s)]
*  Fuck everything man. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3489.0s)]
*  The reason why I get into combat sports. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3490.0s)]
*  Basically MMA was because it was fun. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3493.0s)]
*  I was never going to do MMA. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3496.0s)]
*  I just kept training like oh it's fun. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3498.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3501.0s)]
*  Let's keep going. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3502.0s)]
*  Then I realized that that fun wasn't there anymore. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3503.0s)]
*  And that's why I was falling down. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3507.0s)]
*  Because I start focusing on what people think. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3510.0s)]
*  People reaction. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3513.0s)]
*  People feelings. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3514.0s)]
*  And then I forget the reason why I was falling down. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3516.0s)]
*  And then I forget the reason why I started the sport. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3519.0s)]
*  So now I get the second fight again. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3522.0s)]
*  Curtis played in China. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3524.0s)]
*  I'm like okay this might be the end. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3526.0s)]
*  I don't think if I lost this fight it's going to be good for me. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3529.0s)]
*  But at least I earned it how I started. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3532.0s)]
*  Just by fun. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3537.0s)]
*  Just go there. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3539.0s)]
*  Enjoy yourself. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3541.0s)]
*  Have fun. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3542.0s)]
*  And don't worry about what's next. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3543.0s)]
*  And then 45 seconds the guy was down. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3546.0s)]
*  And then Ken Velasquez, 25 seconds the guy was down. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3549.0s)]
*  I was just there to have fun. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3552.0s)]
*  Junior Dos Santos, the guy was down. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3555.0s)]
*  Seems like having fun. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3558.0s)]
*  You found your groove again. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3560.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3561.0s)]
*  Having fun is exactly why I'm doing this. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3562.0s)]
*  And it's why I'm good at it. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3565.0s)]
*  Let's just do it. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3568.0s)]
*  So I try not to put pressure on me. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3570.0s)]
*  Every fight I'm like I'm going to go there, do my best, make sure that everything that should have been done is done on my end. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3574.0s)]
*  And the rest I don't control it. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3583.0s)]
*  Have you ever worked with a sports psychologist? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3585.0s)]
*  Man I don't believe in that. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3588.0s)]
*  No? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3591.0s)]
*  No I don't believe. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3592.0s)]
*  I think everything is in our mind. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3594.0s)]
*  You can go out there trying to find all those stuff but you have it in your mind. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3597.0s)]
*  You can speak to yourself. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3603.0s)]
*  You can question to yourself. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3605.0s)]
*  I mean I don't need a sports psychology to tell me why I'm doing this. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3607.0s)]
*  It's out of passion. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3613.0s)]
*  I do this because I love it. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3614.0s)]
*  It's not a job. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3616.0s)]
*  You understand? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3618.0s)]
*  I question myself like why did I get here? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3619.0s)]
*  How come did I came from where I came from and get here? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3624.0s)]
*  Then I find all those reasons and then therefore I put my stuff together. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3629.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3634.0s)]
*  Maybe some people do. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3635.0s)]
*  Some people clearly need people to like help them to control their self. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3637.0s)]
*  I see that in a lot of fighters basically. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3645.0s)]
*  They need like a coach or something, somebody to tell them what to do like they don't know. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3648.0s)]
*  Like to tell them what time to train. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3653.0s)]
*  You know you have a fight. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3656.0s)]
*  You're going to schedule your training at this time. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3658.0s)]
*  You have this and this to work on. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3661.0s)]
*  You can schedule that and get there every day. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3663.0s)]
*  At the same time do your thing, go home, get ready for another day. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3667.0s)]
*  But some people do need somebody to get them that. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3672.0s)]
*  So do you schedule all your training? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3676.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3678.0s)]
*  Everything? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3679.0s)]
*  I schedule everything. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3680.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3681.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3682.0s)]
*  I organize all my team. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3683.0s)]
*  You know mostly about people that I feel the good energy about. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3685.0s)]
*  Because again I don't believe in so many things. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3690.0s)]
*  I don't believe in like oh this guy is the great, he's a great trainer, he can do this. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3694.0s)]
*  No, I believe that everything comes from a fighter and the energy that people around him can bring, can help him win. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3699.0s)]
*  So when I, in my team, I favor people energy. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3707.0s)]
*  People like how the energy that they bring around, you know, I favor them and that's how I judge if somebody is best or not is by his energy. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3712.0s)]
*  And that's how I get along with pretty much everybody of my team. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3722.0s)]
*  We, I judge everybody based on his energy. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3728.0s)]
*  If I feel like this is, I rather have a good person next to me and then not to say my team, my team is great. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3733.0s)]
*  They are all great. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3741.0s)]
*  Everybody is very professional, commit. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3742.0s)]
*  But if I feel like somebody has this energy and not even great as great, I prefer that person than somebody that is a great trainer and don't bring that energy because the energy is very important. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3746.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3765.0s)]
*  When you start to get tired, when you're in the tough situation, the voice that you can listen and trust is more important than the technique that you can learn. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3766.0s)]
*  You can't know all the techniques in the world and if you get there, your mind is not right. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3775.0s)]
*  You are not doing shit. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3779.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3781.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3783.0s)]
*  So the energy of the people you got, that's all down. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3784.0s)]
*  You got a great trainer, Dewey Cooper. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3786.0s)]
*  He's fantastic. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3788.0s)]
*  I get, I still get, I get Dewey Cooper, even Eric. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3789.0s)]
*  Eric Nixic. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3793.0s)]
*  Eric Nixic. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3794.0s)]
*  We're still here because I remember even how we get together, he wasn't most like a coach. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3795.0s)]
*  I was in a fighting junior dos Santos and I have only Dewey Cooper with Markel on my team and I reached out, I asked Markel, like, we should bring somebody in the corner or something and he talked about Eric. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3804.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I always meet Eric around and he's nice. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3819.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yes, let's try him. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3822.0s)]
*  And then we get to the locker. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3825.0s)]
*  Suddenly, I feel the energy was great. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3827.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, man, this is good. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3830.0s)]
*  I like this vibe in my team. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3833.0s)]
*  That's for me is enough. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3836.0s)]
*  You know, that's why I like sometimes I understand. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3838.0s)]
*  Once I saw Mike Perry, he went to a fight with only his wife in his corner. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3841.0s)]
*  And then people was criticizing him. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3846.0s)]
*  I'm like, I understand him. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3848.0s)]
*  He's doing the right thing. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3851.0s)]
*  He understand how the games work. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3852.0s)]
*  He just want a voice that can speak to him when he's tired. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3854.0s)]
*  Somebody that he trusts and all those stuff and everything. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3857.0s)]
*  He already knows how to fight. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3861.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3862.0s)]
*  He knows how to fight. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3863.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3864.0s)]
*  Because nobody is going to raise your hand and punch on somebody. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3865.0s)]
*  Oh, like nobody is going to dodge a punch for you. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3868.0s)]
*  Nobody going to say, oh, knock him out now. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3872.0s)]
*  For now, you know, it's just it's fighting game is mental, more mental and improvisation. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3874.0s)]
*  So you schedule everything. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3882.0s)]
*  You schedule your strength and conditioning. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3884.0s)]
*  You schedule your sparring. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3886.0s)]
*  You schedule everything. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3887.0s)]
*  You just do it all based on how you feel and what you need to get done. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3888.0s)]
*  No, like I schedule. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3894.0s)]
*  I mean, I get a strain and conditioning, for example, for this camp. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3895.0s)]
*  I get the trip out. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3900.0s)]
*  It's out here with me. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3902.0s)]
*  So we talk about the goal. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3903.0s)]
*  What is the goal? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3906.0s)]
*  What is the deficiency? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3907.0s)]
*  What do we want? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3908.0s)]
*  Where do we want to get by the fight? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3909.0s)]
*  We are 12 weeks out. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3912.0s)]
*  OK, what is what we want to work on and what would be the good space? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3915.0s)]
*  Then we get that schedule. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3920.0s)]
*  Then with the boxing team, we speak around. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3923.0s)]
*  But I always try to get my team together. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3926.0s)]
*  So sometimes they can just work together. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3929.0s)]
*  They don't always need to come to me on staff. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3932.0s)]
*  You know, they can. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3935.0s)]
*  My team can communicate together on the also on my schedule. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3936.0s)]
*  But yes. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3941.0s)]
*  So when you train, you do strength conditioning, are you using a heart rate monitor? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3942.0s)]
*  Are you paying attention to your resting heart rate? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3948.0s)]
*  What it's like when you wake up, your heart rate variability? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3951.0s)]
*  Do you get involved in any of those things? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3954.0s)]
*  Sometimes, not always. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3956.0s)]
*  Sometimes I even do the test to see where I am at. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3958.0s)]
*  Yeah, even the VO2 max. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3963.0s)]
*  But we focus on I think like the most important thing for me right now. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3967.0s)]
*  My injuries. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3977.0s)]
*  It's all about my injuries. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3979.0s)]
*  Do you have other injuries other than your knee? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3981.0s)]
*  Injury? No. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3984.0s)]
*  I mean, you get sore. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3986.0s)]
*  If you get to a training camp to the end without pain somewhere, then you better worry. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3989.0s)]
*  You probably didn't do enough. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3997.0s)]
*  Yeah, you probably didn't do it right. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=3999.0s)]
*  So that's the thing. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4001.0s)]
*  That's the reality of the sport. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4003.0s)]
*  That's the reality of the sport. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4005.0s)]
*  You can like train hard for three months and feel great every day and don't feel like something's wrong. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4006.0s)]
*  No, that means you're not doing something right. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4013.0s)]
*  Is it easier to train for boxing because you don't have to do the wrestling, you don't have to do the kicking? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4017.0s)]
*  Is it like less likely that you get injured? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4023.0s)]
*  Sometimes you think so, but when you get there, it's different. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4026.0s)]
*  You know, like in the first two weeks in the, he wasn't even a training camp. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4031.0s)]
*  He was a pre-camp. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4036.0s)]
*  My first two weeks in boxing, straight boxing, I felt that I felt the difference. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4038.0s)]
*  Of course, you get excited, excited because, oh, you're not going to kick or kick down or this is just boxing. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4044.0s)]
*  Oh, you're not going to you don't risk injury for your knee and that because now I always think about my knee. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4052.0s)]
*  Then you get there, you start a kid, mid-hit part, do all those stuff. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4059.0s)]
*  You always your hands up and then your shoulders start to hurt. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4065.0s)]
*  Then you throw more punch in two weeks than you have ever thrown in the training camp in the two month, two, three month training camp. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4069.0s)]
*  Then you're like, ah, there is a difference. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4076.0s)]
*  You know, your shoulder feels different. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4079.0s)]
*  Like it's not the same thing in MMA. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4082.0s)]
*  You throw one, two, kick one, two, three, kick one, take down. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4084.0s)]
*  Dairy boxing, wrestling, cage wrestling, all those stuff. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4088.0s)]
*  Now in boxing, your hands has to go all the time and when he's not going, he has to be on your face, protecting your face. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4092.0s)]
*  Otherwise, you're going to eat that punch clearly. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4101.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4104.0s)]
*  So when you prepare for a fight like this, you've never had a big professional boxing fight before. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4106.0s)]
*  And this is the biggest of all time. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4113.0s)]
*  I mean, you're literally fighting the greatest heavyweight of all time. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4115.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4118.0s)]
*  How do you know when to peak? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4119.0s)]
*  How do you know like when you're ready? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4121.0s)]
*  Because you haven't done this kind of training before. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4123.0s)]
*  You will never be ready. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4128.0s)]
*  Even at a fight night, you will always think like, oh, if I have this, maybe I should have done this instead. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4130.0s)]
*  Maybe I just would have hurt me. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4137.0s)]
*  You know, when is the good time you have to go? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4139.0s)]
*  So you just have to make sure to get there in your best, you know, the best you can do, the best you can do. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4142.0s)]
*  The best you can do without burn out because there's also a balance in between because if you overdo, then you burn out by the time you get to a fight. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4148.0s)]
*  That's why I was asking about heart rate monitors and checking your resting heart rate and heart rate variability. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4157.0s)]
*  Because one of the best ways to find out if you are over trained is to check your resting heart rate when you wake up first thing in the morning. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4163.0s)]
*  And if it's up eight beats a minute, 10 beats a minute, most likely you went too hard. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4169.0s)]
*  And then they suggest like an active recovery day, a lighter training day where you're still moving, you're still working on technique, but you're not pushing. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4174.0s)]
*  You're not really pushing. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4183.0s)]
*  And you even when your heart rate monitor indicate that I used to use the Overwatch and when he indicate almost indicate how you feel, you feel it. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4185.0s)]
*  And then when you have a good team, they can also measure the mass of your training and they can also work around it. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4198.0s)]
*  They know, OK, Monday and Tuesday, we went hard on this. Wednesday has to be slow and this, you know, maybe work on technique or like on the strain on this and that all those aspects. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4209.0s)]
*  And that's why a team is very good about because you can like by yourself think about everything. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4223.0s)]
*  No, no, you need other people. Yeah. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4231.0s)]
*  You need other people to help you because things get so big. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4233.0s)]
*  You need other people to help you and everybody is kind of like he have his own department to worry about. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4238.0s)]
*  And so when you're training, how much sparring are you doing? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4247.0s)]
*  How many days a week? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4251.0s)]
*  Um, three or two. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4253.0s)]
*  Sometimes it depends again how you feel and how the recovery been. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4255.0s)]
*  How was the sparring? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4261.0s)]
*  You know, sometimes you get sparring and you feel like, yeah, even though you did the amount of run around that you are supposed to do, but you wasn't that intense. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4262.0s)]
*  And then the next day, no, maybe you keep you push again, you know, and sometimes you just go to a sparring and that's when it's hard. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4275.0s)]
*  The guy gives you a hard time. You push the pace is high and is then next day. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4286.0s)]
*  Maybe need to recovery, not like recovery, but slow it down. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4291.0s)]
*  Give your shoulder some rest because you always end up on maybe heavy backs like it's all about that balance. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4296.0s)]
*  But it's like two trees, two trees. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4304.0s)]
*  And are you sparring with any world class heavyweights? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4307.0s)]
*  Um, world class so far, no, the only guy that I used to spar with, which is a world class heavyweight, it's Carlos Tacam. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4310.0s)]
*  And he's now just coming in the training camp because he's also going to fight in a on the on the card. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4322.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is a world class. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4330.0s)]
*  And we're going to get the we were talking about some guy that we were bringing like experienced fighters, boxer to spar. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4332.0s)]
*  What is it like for you to spar boxers and not be able to kick, not be able to take them down? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4342.0s)]
*  Does it create any adjustment for you? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4349.0s)]
*  I wasn't an expert of kicking either way. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4352.0s)]
*  So you kick hard. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4355.0s)]
*  Again, I wasn't an expert of kicking. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4357.0s)]
*  I was an expert of taking down. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4360.0s)]
*  But you did defend your heavyweight title. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4363.0s)]
*  A lot of it with wrestling because of your knee. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4365.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I couldn't do that was the only option that I had. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4368.0s)]
*  You know, I couldn't I wasn't comfortable moving. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4371.0s)]
*  I was we should tell people you went into that fight to defend your heavyweight title with torn knee ligaments. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4375.0s)]
*  Yeah, your knee was fucked up going. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4383.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4385.0s)]
*  Meniscus. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4387.0s)]
*  And you're fighting Cyril Ghan, who's the most agile, light footed heavyweight. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4389.0s)]
*  He moves everywhere. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4394.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, you need I need to figure a way. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4396.0s)]
*  Nobody moves like that guy. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4399.0s)]
*  Yeah. But one thing that helped me into that fight a lot, I believe in myself. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4400.0s)]
*  I know that I'm going to get him. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4406.0s)]
*  I wasn't looking for knockout. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4408.0s)]
*  Once again, I wasn't looking for knockout, but I know that I'm going to have my opportunity at some moment in the fight. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4411.0s)]
*  That's where like the first two rounds, I was little like worried about how to move on this and that like on my knee or this, you know. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4417.0s)]
*  But I was confident. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4428.0s)]
*  And after the first two rounds, I'm like, man, I'm losing. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4431.0s)]
*  You can't end like this. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4435.0s)]
*  No, not like this. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4437.0s)]
*  We need to do something. Switch it up. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4439.0s)]
*  To switch it up. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4442.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4444.0s)]
*  Was that a satisfying victory for you, though, knowing that you could beat one of the best heavyweights in the world with only one leg? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4445.0s)]
*  He was the most satisfying. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4453.0s)]
*  Yes, by far the best because there was I was he wasn't one fight at that night. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4456.0s)]
*  That night I was fighting like four. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4462.0s)]
*  I was fighting my demons, my knee, this, everything. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4465.0s)]
*  The contract. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4471.0s)]
*  I was fighting the contract. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4472.0s)]
*  I was fighting the narrative. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4474.0s)]
*  I was fighting everything that can go wrong. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4476.0s)]
*  And I couldn't strip this fight better than this. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4479.0s)]
*  If you ask me, like, how would you like to win? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4482.0s)]
*  I would say knockout, obviously, which is the easiest way. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4485.0s)]
*  But everybody predicted me to be like, OK, he has a chance in the two first rounds to knock Siri out. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4488.0s)]
*  After that, his power is going down. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4495.0s)]
*  Then his cardio is going down. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4497.0s)]
*  He has nothing. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4499.0s)]
*  He was the completely opposite way. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4500.0s)]
*  They say, oh, Siri has a cardio after two rounds, after a fight. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4503.0s)]
*  He can fight two fights a night. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4507.0s)]
*  I'm like, bro, come on, depend. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4509.0s)]
*  You know, at the end of the fight, I'm like, I'm not sure that he's ready to fight another fight, to take another fight on. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4511.0s)]
*  Tonight, you know, and unlike what they predicted, I lost the two first round and I started to win from the third round, which is like the contrary of what they predicted. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4517.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4530.0s)]
*  So but nobody knew that your knee was that fucked up either, though. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4531.0s)]
*  The UFC, the UFC knew it was injured. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4535.0s)]
*  They let you ride. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4538.0s)]
*  No, no, they know everything. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4539.0s)]
*  They knew everything. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4540.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4541.0s)]
*  When I did the MRI, he went to Dr. Davidson. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4542.0s)]
*  And then when he was explaining it to me, he said only four people know about this by now. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4547.0s)]
*  Dana Hunter, you and I. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4554.0s)]
*  That's when he was how he was. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4557.0s)]
*  Did you consider pulling out of the fight? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4559.0s)]
*  I thought, yeah. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4564.0s)]
*  You know, in the perfect scenario, I would have pulled out a fight, you know, but I didn't want to give them an opportunity. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4566.0s)]
*  Another extension. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4574.0s)]
*  It wasn't about the extension. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4575.0s)]
*  It was just to bury me. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4578.0s)]
*  I don't want to give the opportunity to bury me. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4580.0s)]
*  You know how you know how in this world they say, OK, I'm going to die with my soul in my hand. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4583.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4590.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4591.0s)]
*  But when I heard about when they explained to me what was going on in my knee, I was very, I was very worried. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4592.0s)]
*  Then for somehow I call, I call, I call Kamaru or he called me anyway. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4603.0s)]
*  We were in the phone and we were talking and he would explain me like, you know, I'm going to die with my soul in my hand. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4609.0s)]
*  We were in the phone and we were talking and he would explain me like what he had and this. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4618.0s)]
*  And I remember once I saw him in Vegas when he fought. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4625.0s)]
*  I think was Kobe Carvington the first time. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4629.0s)]
*  And the guy was messed up, man. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4632.0s)]
*  He was working like this in the fire week, getting caught. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4634.0s)]
*  He's on shot here and there. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4638.0s)]
*  I'm like, damn, this guy is going to fight. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4640.0s)]
*  Maybe was Tyron Woodland said, so this guy is going to fight on Saturday. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4643.0s)]
*  I was so worried. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4650.0s)]
*  I feel bad about it. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4652.0s)]
*  Man, at that night, he was sharp. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4654.0s)]
*  This is the guy that I saw him on Wednesday. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4658.0s)]
*  He was barely able to work. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4662.0s)]
*  He was sharp and I know exactly what was wrong with him. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4664.0s)]
*  So that kind of like hurt me to believe that man, when comes the moment, you know, fighting your fighting is then we take off. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4669.0s)]
*  Kamaru is so strong mentally. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4678.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4680.0s)]
*  People knew how bad his knees are. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4681.0s)]
*  His knees are so bad. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4683.0s)]
*  He has to go backwards downstairs sometimes. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4685.0s)]
*  Sometimes. Yeah. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4688.0s)]
*  And then you'll be like, oh, his hips, his this. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4689.0s)]
*  I'm like, bro, you can't pull out the fight now. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4693.0s)]
*  He's going to fight and then he show up to the fight. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4697.0s)]
*  Looks perfect. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4700.0s)]
*  Looks perfect. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4701.0s)]
*  There is no way that is, you know, so I kind of like that's kind of like inspiring me feel better about myself. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4702.0s)]
*  I'm like, man, I can't do this. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4710.0s)]
*  You know, like it's not over yet. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4712.0s)]
*  Right. I have something left. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4714.0s)]
*  So I keep even though I couldn't train anymore, I couldn't rest. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4717.0s)]
*  So I couldn't do anything. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4721.0s)]
*  And I was three weeks away from three weeks and a half away from the fight. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4723.0s)]
*  So I started to focus on my air bike, you know, cardio, cardio, up work, you know, body work. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4727.0s)]
*  But wasn't as it easy. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4735.0s)]
*  But I think my air bike helped me a lot because from not be trained for over three weeks before the fight and get there like that wasn't too bad. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4738.0s)]

*  Take them. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4911.0s)]
*  Don't take them. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4912.0s)]

*  I have to take them. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4916.0s)]
*  And then Glenn, they will always like get those back ready for me. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4917.0s)]
*  And with all the vitamins and how to take it every day. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4921.0s)]
*  And I would take it like two, three, four days. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4927.0s)]
*  And after. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4930.0s)]
*  Just quit. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4931.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4932.0s)]
*  Did you notice a difference? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4933.0s)]
*  Taking or not taking it? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4934.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4935.0s)]
*  It's all hard, right? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4936.0s)]
*  I know these are is really hard. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4937.0s)]
*  One thing that you don't have to think about with this fight is your weight. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4940.0s)]
*  you don't have to make the 265 pound weight limit. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4944.0s)]
*  Well. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4947.3s)]
*  What are you walking around at? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4948.14s)]
*  It's still different because the weight limit, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4950.1s)]
*  even when I fight MMA, sometimes I get there at 260, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4953.58s)]
*  below 260. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4957.3s)]
*  I don't, it's not because I'm cutting weight. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4959.58s)]
*  You're not thinking about it. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4961.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not thinking about it. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4962.7s)]
*  I mean, I do work in order to get my weight down, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4964.46s)]
*  but I don't cut weight. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4967.62s)]
*  I don't have a big process of diet, you know, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4968.82s)]
*  or to cut weight. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4973.160000000001s)]
*  I just train properly and eat properly with the chef. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4974.400000000001s)]
*  And sometimes I myself to get there. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4977.84s)]
*  But even now I still have to think about it [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4980.8s)]
*  because I've got based to the game plan, you know, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4984.160000000001s)]
*  I don't want to have a extra 10 pound, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4987.8s)]
*  unnecessary 10 pound on me. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4990.52s)]
*  But at the same time, I don't also want to lose a strain [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4992.76s)]
*  because as I said, this guy is a big dude. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=4996.88s)]
*  And he has skills to like to lean on people, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5000.2s)]
*  weigh them down, stuff like that, you know. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5005.62s)]
*  I think they're going to be a little bit of a wrestling there. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5009.58s)]
*  I need to get my strength right. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5013.22s)]
*  So he has to be a balance. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5014.7s)]
*  And I walk around like 275, 280, my normal weight, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5016.98s)]
*  walk around weight. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5024.82s)]
*  But I think my getting the fight at 265, I don't know, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5026.54s)]
*  it depends on how we decide this to go. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5032.22s)]
*  So without giving away too much of your strategy, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5037.66s)]
*  how do you envision this fight taking place? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5040.78s)]
*  Like what you've never boxed a heavyweight like him before, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5043.72s)]
*  you obviously have tremendous skills and power. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5048.92s)]
*  What, how do you envision this fight taking place? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5051.86s)]
*  Well, it's very hard to envision, you know. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5055.7s)]
*  Sometime I just visualize the fight, me there in the ring. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5060.38s)]
*  Suppose I'm going to be the blue corner, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5065.0599999999995s)]
*  being there waiting for him to get in the ring. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5067.42s)]
*  He knows all the sides of the ring. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5070.58s)]
*  He's been there. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5073.62s)]
*  He know all the corner, how to move, how to cut everything. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5075.26s)]
*  And I'm going to be there, figure out how to cut [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5079.099999999999s)]
*  the ring, you know. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5082.74s)]
*  It's really hard. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5087.66s)]
*  I think I just got to focus on like being composed, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5088.7s)]
*  you know, don't think about too much stuff. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5093.94s)]
*  And again, I would like the knockout, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5096.679999999999s)]
*  but you know, Tyson is very slick and you can go, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5099.92s)]
*  like you want to knock him out. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5105.7s)]
*  So I'm preparing in the way that this fight can go [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5107.46s)]
*  all the way to 10 rounds. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5112.74s)]
*  Yeah, which is a disadvantage for me. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5114.7s)]
*  I never fight boxing at that level, you know. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5119.54s)]
*  So managing my energy, how I going to be feeling [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5122.9s)]
*  with all the pressure and the adrenaline, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5127.219999999999s)]
*  how are they going to be like in the 10 rounds, you know. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5130.0199999999995s)]
*  So how can I maximize it the most? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5135.179999999999s)]
*  It's about that. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5139.74s)]
*  I visualize it a lot. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5143.48s)]
*  I think about it trying to be there that night, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5144.799999999999s)]
*  waiting for him, see him come, do his show, you know, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5148.16s)]
*  get there, trying to do his slick stuff, you know, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5152.16s)]
*  weigh me down, slick, dirty boxing, come close, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5157.28s)]
*  trying to lean on my head because he's taller than me. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5162.639999999999s)]
*  But I think, yeah, but I think I can handle that dirty boxing [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5167.64s)]
*  properly because usually like boxing guy, [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5177.84s)]
*  I have seen a lot inspiring and since everybody want to do [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5181.08s)]
*  the same thing like Tyson, like trying to prepare you [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5184.740000000001s)]
*  for that, there's still those wrestling trick [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5188.08s)]
*  that you can get into. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5191.860000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I like, I'm like go under the shoulder [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5193.88s)]
*  and step in your back. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5197.32s)]
*  Yeah, which is something that boxer they don't do, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5199.32s)]
*  they don't know. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5202.0s)]
*  So yeah, I don't have to worry about that still. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5202.84s)]
*  Are you going to have, like, I know that when Sugar Ray Leonard [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5209.08s)]
*  made his comeback, one of the things that he did was [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5212.0s)]
*  he had actual fights, like to prepare himself [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5214.400000000001s)]
*  so he didn't have any ring rust, he would have actual fights [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5218.24s)]
*  in the gym with like regulation size gloves, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5221.0s)]
*  no head gear, 10 rounds, 12 rounds, whatever it was, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5224.56s)]
*  he would have actual fights. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5228.32s)]
*  I think we had that a lot of time. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5230.68s)]
*  I mean, we fight MMA with four ounce gloves, right? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5232.34s)]
*  And we don't fight with head gear, with kicks and everything. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5236.52s)]
*  So I'm not worried about that. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5242.68s)]
*  And we used to spar when you're an MMA fighter, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5245.98s)]
*  they don't spar boxing with the protection, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5249.04s)]
*  the head gear and stuff, they just go in the gym, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5252.2s)]
*  they don't worry the size of their gloves. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5255.46s)]
*  But boxing guys, they come to the gym, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5258.24s)]
*  everything is checked, like what's the size of the gloves, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5260.88s)]
*  to check the head gears, the this, the cup, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5264.56s)]
*  and all the stuff. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5268.92s)]
*  I mean, now I do that to protect myself. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5270.24s)]
*  I have a fight in less than six weeks, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5272.44s)]
*  so I take all those precautions, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5275.44s)]
*  but I don't think I'm gonna do that by now. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5279.04s)]
*  If I was six months out, yes, I can do something like that. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5282.5199999999995s)]
*  But now I have no interest of doing that. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5286.639999999999s)]
*  I know I can deal with that. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5289.04s)]
*  I have got hit with four ounce gloves in the fight, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5290.719999999999s)]
*  I have been there. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5296.0s)]
*  I haven't done boxing yet, but I have been in a fight [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5297.5599999999995s)]
*  more than once, so I'm gonna be okay. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5300.799999999999s)]
*  And one thing that, and we are going to talk about is [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5303.72s)]
*  Tyson gloves. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5310.6s)]
*  He's very tricky with his gloves. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5313.92s)]
*  I think he's cheating. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5316.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard a lot of complain about his gloves, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5317.08s)]
*  which is like his glove has no protection. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5321.2s)]
*  Where have you heard this from? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5325.280000000001s)]
*  Even when he fought Deontay Walder, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5326.6s)]
*  he complained about that. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5329.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but did you ever look into that though? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5330.88s)]
*  The rectus, right? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5332.4s)]
*  Complained about that. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5333.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's what we are talking about the team. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5334.92s)]
*  And then I'm like, oh, there's the UK commission, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5337.679999999999s)]
*  the gloves. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5340.08s)]
*  I'm like, bro, we're gonna get there. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5340.9s)]
*  We need every gloves to be checked. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5343.719999999999s)]
*  You don't tell me about this commission, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5346.36s)]
*  all the gloves had get to be checked. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5348.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't want, if you want us to fight bare hands, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5351.28s)]
*  bare knuckles, let's go bare knuckles. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5355.16s)]
*  But don't give me a 10 ounce gloves [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5357.599999999999s)]
*  and wear eight ounce or six ounce gloves [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5359.56s)]
*  because he has no protection. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5363.360000000001s)]
*  Now. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5364.76s)]
*  You really think he's doing that? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5365.6s)]
*  I think so. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5366.72s)]
*  I mean, I have heard. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5367.68s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen the Deontay Walder videos, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5369.0s)]
*  but they're not convincing. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5372.080000000001s)]
*  Here's why. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5373.96s)]
*  They're showing those videos in slow motion. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5374.92s)]
*  And in slow motion, it looks like his glove [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5377.56s)]
*  is flopping all over the place. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5379.88s)]
*  But that's just because it's in slow motion. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5381.92s)]
*  When you watch him boxing, he's doing this. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5383.92s)]
*  He flicks, flicks, flicks. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5386.68s)]
*  He shows you it, pop, and then he drops a big punch in. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5388.42s)]
*  So in slow motion, it looks like it's all floppy, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5391.5s)]
*  like it's not connected. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5395.02s)]
*  And you think that the gloves are really [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5396.22s)]
*  like just flopping around and where his knuckles are [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5398.54s)]
*  is where the wrap is. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5401.02s)]
*  But that's not the case, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5401.9400000000005s)]
*  because if you look at the length of his arm, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5402.82s)]
*  none of that makes sense. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5404.34s)]
*  Yeah, but his opponent complains about his gloves. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5405.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if they're right. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5408.14s)]
*  I mean, they might not be. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5409.38s)]
*  I don't know if they're right. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5411.54s)]
*  We have to check that. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5413.14s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm sure. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5414.86s)]
*  I think it's legit. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5416.5s)]
*  I think he's legit. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5417.74s)]
*  I just think he's that good. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5418.82s)]
*  No, he's good, he's good. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5420.0199999999995s)]
*  And his style of keeping that hand loose and flicking. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5421.54s)]
*  So sometimes that wrist opens way up. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5425.179999999999s)]
*  If you look at it in slow motion, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5427.74s)]
*  people are like, look, his glove's not even attached. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5429.74s)]
*  His glove's attached. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5432.3s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5433.34s)]
*  because after he does this, he does this. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5434.78s)]
*  There's no way he's doing this if his glove's not attached. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5437.62s)]
*  It's attached. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5440.5s)]
*  He just loosens his hands, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5441.5s)]
*  because a lot of his punches, he's just showing you things. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5443.219999999999s)]
*  He's showing you things. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5446.62s)]
*  He's showing you this, and then he's doing all this. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5447.9s)]
*  So a lot of it is loose, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5450.14s)]
*  and he's just popping you with that, like a whip. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5451.54s)]
*  You know? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5454.1s)]
*  I think we have nothing to lose by double check. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5455.42s)]
*  Nothing to lose by double check. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5458.06s)]
*  Yeah, because there's been more than once [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5459.34s)]
*  that people talk about his gloves. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5462.38s)]
*  Right, but nobody needs them. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5463.94s)]
*  And even his opening. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5464.78s)]
*  Even his opening. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5465.62s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure they talk about it. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5466.78s)]
*  It kicks their ass. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5468.22s)]
*  People looking for reasons. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5470.0199999999995s)]
*  Deontay Wilder thought he got poisoned. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5471.62s)]
*  You know, he thought, right? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5473.94s)]
*  He thought a lot of things. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5475.5s)]
*  But you know, that's because the guy's that good. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5477.22s)]
*  He's fucking good, man, you know? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5479.78s)]
*  And I just think that style, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5481.82s)]
*  when you look at it in slow motion, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5483.78s)]
*  it might look like his gloves are not attached, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5485.38s)]
*  but they are most certainly attached. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5487.3s)]
*  But in the boxing world, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5488.54s)]
*  you have to worry about everything. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5489.78s)]
*  It's a dirty world. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5490.62s)]
*  You're right. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5491.58s)]
*  It's a dirty world. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5492.42s)]
*  You have to worry about everything. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5493.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's a dirty world. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5494.78s)]
*  I mean, if somebody says something in the boxing, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5495.62s)]
*  you better just double check. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5498.06s)]
*  Double check. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5499.34s)]
*  Double check. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5500.18s)]
*  What has Tyson brought to the table? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5501.02s)]
*  Like training with Mike Tyson. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5503.38s)]
*  What did he help you with? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5505.379999999999s)]
*  And what kind of strategies did he give you? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5507.379999999999s)]
*  And what kind of thought process? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5509.339999999999s)]
*  What is his approach to you fighting Tyson Fury? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5511.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, asking that question [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5515.78s)]
*  makes me feel like you don't really understand. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5519.46s)]
*  Like, I grew up idolizing Mike Tyson. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5522.259999999999s)]
*  Yes. Right? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5525.82s)]
*  Everybody did. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5526.78s)]
*  And then, as having a dream to become a world-class boxer, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5528.339999999999s)]
*  my first boxing match, Mike Tyson is in the gym. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5533.5s)]
*  Like, oh, nowadays, that, that. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5536.66s)]
*  I'm like, come on a moment. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5539.58s)]
*  Like, this is real. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5541.7s)]
*  This is how, this is where I get. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5543.5s)]
*  So it's real. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5545.3s)]
*  This is legit. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5546.14s)]
*  Your first boxing match. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5546.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, this is legit. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5547.9400000000005s)]
*  Mike Tyson's in your corner. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5548.78s)]
*  I can't make Tyson cheer. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5549.7s)]
*  Like, even mentally, like just thinking like that. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5551.54s)]
*  Like hearing him cheer you on. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5554.54s)]
*  Sometimes I'm like, yes, it's him, right? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5556.3s)]
*  Like, I'm not tripping. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5559.02s)]
*  I'm not tripping. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5560.94s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, Jack, because it's really Mike Tyson. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5563.78s)]
*  I'm like, okay, this thing is serious. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5565.58s)]
*  And not only he's there and he believes [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5567.379999999999s)]
*  that you can beat this guy. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5570.58s)]
*  That's how it is. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5573.339999999999s)]
*  So like, he put his faith on you. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5575.0599999999995s)]
*  A guy that have done everything in boxing that is there. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5578.7s)]
*  You're like, so he see me as somebody that can do this. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5582.379999999999s)]
*  Mm. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5587.26s)]
*  We were talking about like mental stuff. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5589.42s)]
*  These some mental stuff that are heavy, right? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5592.26s)]
*  Not to mention his technique. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5596.660000000001s)]
*  Mike Tyson has a unique style that I'm not, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5598.34s)]
*  I wish I had his style, but I'm not going to expect [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5602.700000000001s)]
*  to copy his style because it's unique to him. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5607.22s)]
*  Well, he's also built very differently. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5611.18s)]
*  His build different. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5612.660000000001s)]
*  He was always short, the shortest guy in the room. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5613.660000000001s)]
*  So with his opening, which is the case in this fight, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5617.74s)]
*  I'm the shortest, his technique, if I can get. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5620.339999999999s)]
*  And then one thing that people always see [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5623.98s)]
*  is how strong he was. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5626.82s)]
*  He was knocking people out. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5628.54s)]
*  And nobody was impressed of how he was able to move [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5630.219999999999s)]
*  from left to right and this, how this footwork [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5634.339999999999s)]
*  and all those stuff, how he was that short [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5638.299999999999s)]
*  and was able to get into the distance [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5641.0199999999995s)]
*  when he wanted to hit and all the stuff, right? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5644.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5647.22s)]
*  Which is something that very interesting. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5648.06s)]
*  With Mike Tyson, one best thing that you can get [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5650.3s)]
*  from Mike Tyson is the footwork. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5654.02s)]
*  Footwork. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5656.62s)]
*  Footwork. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5657.46s)]
*  Change from left to right. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5658.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5659.820000000001s)]
*  Because in boxing, everything is about your foot. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5660.860000000001s)]
*  And his footwork, his power was based on his base [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5663.9400000000005s)]
*  on his footwork. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5668.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5669.7s)]
*  Like when you have a good base, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5670.54s)]
*  your punch is definitely stronger [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5672.22s)]
*  when you don't have a good base. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5674.18s)]
*  How to have that good base to send your punch [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5677.02s)]
*  when you're base, right? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5681.54s)]
*  And if you look at Mike Tyson or his fight in his career, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5684.22s)]
*  he was all about the base, the footwork. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5688.1s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5690.900000000001s)]
*  I watched his training sometime on YouTube still. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5691.9800000000005s)]
*  And then you see how he's flipping. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5695.740000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5697.34s)]
*  And I'm like, it's not possible that he can do this. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5698.18s)]
*  I know, for a heavyweight, that's the case. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5700.58s)]
*  So here's you guys working together. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5703.14s)]
*  Yeah, look. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5703.9800000000005s)]
*  And this was four years ago. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5704.820000000001s)]
*  This was the first time that I met Mike Tyson. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5706.5s)]
*  This was in 2019 on his podcast. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5708.700000000001s)]
*  And he was always about his footwork. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5714.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he was so well-trained. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5719.26s)]
*  And when he was young, the way he would move in [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5721.62s)]
*  and bob and weave. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5723.900000000001s)]
*  Look, look, look. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5724.740000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5725.58s)]
*  And he gets you go on that knee. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5726.42s)]
*  I'm like, okay, everything is in the leg. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5728.02s)]
*  In the thigh. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5732.9s)]
*  You do that like twice. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5733.74s)]
*  You know, I'm like, okay, I think I need [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5735.379999999999s)]
*  some low-body workout. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5737.139999999999s)]
*  I'm not struggling now. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5739.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he had a lot of footwork and movement. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5740.259999999999s)]
*  That's why his leg is like this big, like a tree trunk. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5744.259999999999s)]
*  Right, a lot of bobbing and weaving too. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5747.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5750.179999999999s)]
*  People forget, they just think he was a hard puncher. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5751.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, no, people forget. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5753.0199999999995s)]
*  He showed me how he was training for his leg, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5755.139999999999s)]
*  how he would go all the way down [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5759.7s)]
*  and do like this duck work and stuff. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5760.86s)]
*  I'm like, man, come on. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5764.34s)]
*  And that's what he did all his career. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5767.54s)]
*  And people don't see that. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5769.38s)]
*  They just see like, oh, he hit hard, he's strong. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5771.0599999999995s)]
*  No, he's technical and he's hard worker. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5774.94s)]
*  Technical, hard worker, tremendous speed, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5777.5s)]
*  perfect technique, everything. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5780.0199999999995s)]
*  All the above. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5782.179999999999s)]
*  And he hits hard. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5783.26s)]
*  He hits hard. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5784.7s)]
*  Everything. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5785.54s)]
*  I mean, when you put all those, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5786.38s)]
*  when you combine all those stuff, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5787.94s)]
*  there's no way you don't hit hard. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5789.299999999999s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5791.0599999999995s)]
*  So does he have an idea, like looking at your frame [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5792.54s)]
*  and Tyson Fury's frame, does he have an idea [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5797.7s)]
*  of the way you should approach the fight? [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5800.0599999999995s)]
*  Does he give you pointers, like what he thinks [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5802.62s)]
*  that you would do that would be successful [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5805.339999999999s)]
*  against Tyson Fury? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5807.379999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5808.5s)]
*  Because his entire career, he almost fight people [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5809.82s)]
*  that was like Tyson Fury. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5813.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5815.54s)]
*  And that's why I explicitly went to him about this fight. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5816.38s)]
*  Because I feel like, again, if I was able to have like, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5823.46s)]
*  let's say a quarter of what Mike Tyson have, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5827.82s)]
*  this fight would be an easy fight. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5832.54s)]
*  Do you think so, really? [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5834.18s)]
*  I mean, there's not an easy fight, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5838.14s)]
*  but he will be an easier fight. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5839.46s)]
*  Wow. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5844.02s)]
*  I mean, out of all your day, 24 hours a day, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5845.62s)]
*  how often do you think about the fight? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5848.9s)]
*  Every minute? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5851.54s)]
*  Not every minute, but... [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5853.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, now that you're talking about it, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5860.46s)]
*  I don't even know that I'm thinking about a fight [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5862.74s)]
*  when I think about the fight. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5864.74s)]
*  Right, it's just natural. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5865.98s)]
*  It's just natural, it's my life. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5867.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5868.9s)]
*  You know, like the most important thing is what I do. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5869.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5872.98s)]
*  Even when I don't fight, even when I don't have a fight, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5874.34s)]
*  I think about fight. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5877.5s)]
*  It's just like my thing. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5879.099999999999s)]
*  So I can't tell exactly how often I think about a fight, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5881.86s)]
*  but I know sometime I'll go to sleep, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5886.179999999999s)]
*  and then he will just come in my mind, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5888.82s)]
*  and then you start think, you know, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5890.7s)]
*  start exploring those stuff. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5892.9s)]
*  And sometime it's exciting. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5895.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, most of the time it's exciting. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5897.259999999999s)]
*  Sometimes it's also nervous. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5900.46s)]
*  Yes, you're also nervous about the thought that you have. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5902.74s)]
*  You know, like, I'm like, amen. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5907.099999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'm missing this. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5909.66s)]
*  Maybe I'm not taking this serious. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5910.86s)]
*  Maybe this, maybe that, maybe that. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5912.5s)]
*  So, which is good, because after you have those feeling, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5915.34s)]
*  those moment that you are not too confident, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5920.54s)]
*  sometime you wake up like, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5925.94s)]
*  oh, I think I shouldn't go to bed. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5927.34s)]
*  I didn't do enough today. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5929.3s)]
*  I'm like, no, I shouldn't do enough today. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5930.7s)]
*  Like, I need to do more. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=5934.7s)]

*  Regardless of the promotion, I have a fight coming up. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6028.94s)]
*  I have to keep my training schedule. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6032.86s)]
*  And then they bring all my entire team with me. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6035.099999999999s)]

*  Do you have a prediction for this fight? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6046.02s)]
*  Aye, man. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6049.06s)]
*  Prediction for this fight. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6051.740000000001s)]
*  Knock him in the house. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6054.02s)]
*  No, no, I don't wanna have a prediction [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6058.3s)]
*  because I will wanna follow [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6060.580000000001s)]
*  that might stick in my mind [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6066.700000000001s)]
*  and I wanna execute my prediction. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6068.18s)]
*  Maybe just train properly, let it flow, get there. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6070.9400000000005s)]
*  And let what happened happen. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6076.7s)]
*  Just fight, focus on fighting. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6077.54s)]
*  Make sure you fight. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6079.66s)]
*  Make sure you're ready to give everything in there. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6080.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6084.54s)]
*  And some moment, boom. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6085.38s)]
*  It must be so exciting for you to have made that deal though [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6090.099999999999s)]
*  because everybody said that wasn't gonna happen. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6094.139999999999s)]
*  I read so many commentators saying [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6096.98s)]
*  Francis is wasting his time. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6099.0199999999995s)]
*  They're never gonna give him a fight. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6100.7s)]
*  And then? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6102.66s)]
*  That was one, that was, you were asking me like [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6104.06s)]
*  if this is a money. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6109.62s)]
*  That was a money too. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6110.98s)]
*  Once again, to prove people wrong. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6113.46s)]
*  Hey, you motherfucker, you were wrong. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6117.14s)]
*  I'm right again. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6119.86s)]
*  Well, for people who don't know your story, [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6121.9s)]
*  how you went from Cameroon and went to Morocco [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6124.34s)]
*  and got sent back, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6128.86s)]
*  we tried to make it across to Europe, what, seven times? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6130.1s)]
*  Seven times. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6133.860000000001s)]
*  Seven times. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6134.700000000001s)]
*  And you were homeless at the time? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6135.54s)]
*  I mean, I failed six times. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6136.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6138.38s)]
*  Succeeded seven times. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6139.22s)]
*  But that kind of resolve and that kind of discipline [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6140.66s)]
*  and that kind of drive, that's very special. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6144.42s)]
*  And I think you got something from that experience [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6147.780000000001s)]
*  and to prove what you're capable of. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6150.18s)]
*  No, I don't think. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6151.5s)]
*  You have to know. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6152.34s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6153.18s)]
*  You have to know. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6154.02s)]
*  Like sometime, you know, sometime I think about my life, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6154.860000000001s)]
*  why I was going to, my upcoming, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6159.1s)]
*  going through all this process, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6162.06s)]
*  I was always pissed, upset, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6163.780000000001s)]
*  like why all those things happened to me? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6165.54s)]
*  Am I cursed? [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6167.780000000001s)]
*  Like what it is that nothing can go right for me. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6168.740000000001s)]
*  But when I think about it today, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6173.580000000001s)]
*  even though I can go back to that path, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6175.820000000001s)]
*  I think it was a blessing. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6178.9400000000005s)]
*  Because like the life lesson that I have learned [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6181.740000000001s)]
*  from my journey seems like my journey was just preparing me [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6185.740000000001s)]
*  for this moment, for the life that I'm having now. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6191.099999999999s)]
*  Like you get to the point that, [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6194.34s)]
*  you know the moment that I kind of like [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6197.38s)]
*  find out that I'm rich, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6201.82s)]
*  it's not the moment that I check my bank account [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6203.94s)]
*  and see money, it's not the moment that I own a house, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6206.0599999999995s)]
*  it's not the moment that I had a house, a car, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6209.0199999999995s)]
*  it's the moment that I look, I check myself, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6212.78s)]
*  I'm like, okay, what can possibly happen to me [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6216.42s)]
*  that I can't handle, that I haven't seen? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6219.38s)]
*  And I say nothing. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6223.18s)]
*  I can't handle everything, I can't overcome everything. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6224.5s)]
*  So therefore I wasn't afraid of anything. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6227.78s)]
*  I can go ahead and let what happened happen. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6230.74s)]
*  I'm not afraid of falling because I know [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6234.26s)]
*  that I have the ability to stand up. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6237.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's what my life taught me. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6242.14s)]
*  Again, even though I didn't choose that path, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6245.38s)]
*  it did taught me that way. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6249.9s)]
*  And I think it's like one thing that carries me [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6252.259999999999s)]
*  where I am now. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6257.139999999999s)]
*  So let's talk about your PFL deal. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6259.82s)]
*  So where are they gonna get opponents for you? [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6262.419999999999s)]
*  Like who's in the heavyweight division right now on the PFL? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6266.62s)]
*  They're gonna figure that out. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6273.74s)]
*  So they'll probably have to hire people, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6275.339999999999s)]
*  just try to contract people that are. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6277.66s)]
*  Yeah, and they are looking for an option [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6280.099999999999s)]
*  because my fight's supposed to be, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6282.86s)]
*  I supposed to fight in the PFL [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6286.46s)]
*  beginning of next year, February or March. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6288.26s)]
*  So after this fight in October, you'll take some time off [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6292.099999999999s)]
*  and then go to MMA training. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6295.5s)]
*  Yeah. And then get ready for the PFL. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6297.34s)]
*  I have, there is some legit people in the division. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6299.46s)]
*  I have this, there's this guy, Reina Ferrara. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6305.1s)]
*  I think this guy is legit. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6312.22s)]
*  Nobody is saying him. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6313.5s)]
*  Nobody is like really talking about him. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6315.06s)]
*  I'm like keep eyes on this guy. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6317.9800000000005s)]
*  You're gonna see, he's like six, five, six, six guys, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6320.54s)]
*  Brazilian guy, but the way he moves, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6325.3s)]
*  I'm like the way he barks, the way he does things. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6328.78s)]
*  If you check that guy, you can tell me about it. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6332.74s)]
*  So there's, other than that, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6337.099999999999s)]
*  who can they be who is in the roster right now? [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6343.46s)]
*  Auntie Deliah, it's Auntie Deliah I think. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6346.42s)]
*  So they're probably gonna have to recruit, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6351.5s)]
*  they're gonna have to recruit some top tier heavyweights. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6354.099999999999s)]
*  They want you to fight them. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6356.58s)]
*  I wish. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6357.86s)]
*  So yeah, otherwise they have to make a tournament [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6359.0199999999995s)]
*  to get a winner that are gonna fight, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6365.46s)]
*  but I think they need some recruiting. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6368.66s)]
*  And how many fights is your contract with the PFL? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6373.0199999999995s)]
*  Multiple. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6377.9s)]
*  Multiple? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6379.42s)]
*  Multiple. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6380.34s)]
*  Five, six? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6381.74s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6382.58s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6383.54s)]
*  I can't get those. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6385.86s)]
*  You don't wanna give up the details. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6387.06s)]
*  But you're happy with everything though? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6389.34s)]
*  No, I'm happy. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6391.3s)]
*  I'm happy the way that it goes, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6392.46s)]
*  the way that it's structured, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6394.1s)]
*  how the freedom that I have inside the contract, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6395.900000000001s)]
*  and I'm also more happy and excited about the PFL Africa, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6402.18s)]
*  because in the deal we have this PFL Africa [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6407.46s)]
*  that we have to launch in the beginning of 2025, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6410.14s)]
*  and that's how we're gonna expand MMA in Africa. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6414.74s)]
*  It's something that I've been working on, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6420.099999999999s)]
*  trying how to get this there, and it was hard. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6422.42s)]
*  And now I get a whole operation [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6427.46s)]
*  that's gonna be dedicated for that. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6429.98s)]
*  I mean, the work is in the process already, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6433.42s)]
*  but the first event gonna be beginning of 2025. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6435.86s)]
*  So I'm quite excited about that. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6441.38s)]
*  I wanna see some of those monsters that are in Africa [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6444.42s)]
*  get there, come over, and knock people out, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6449.58s)]
*  chop their heads off in the octagon. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6453.0199999999995s)]
*  One of the things you've done that's very nice [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6457.0199999999995s)]
*  is that you've negotiated a minimum purse [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6459.0599999999995s)]
*  for your opponents too, right? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6462.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6464.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6465.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6466.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6467.5s)]
*  Which is, I mean, I don't want just to feel like a guy [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6469.54s)]
*  that goes there and grab the money. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6472.9400000000005s)]
*  Okay, give me the money. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6474.7s)]
*  I want this, I want that, right? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6475.900000000001s)]
*  And then I'm fighting this guy [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6478.1s)]
*  that probably doesn't have a chance, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6479.58s)]
*  because he's struggling, he can have a proper training. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6482.3s)]
*  I'm here having my fancy life, my organized training. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6486.38s)]
*  I can have all the doctor that I want. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6490.66s)]
*  I can have the team that I want, nutrition, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6493.22s)]
*  nutritionist, this coach, that, that, that. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6496.3s)]
*  And then I fight a guy that didn't have a chance, [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6499.46s)]
*  and he's in this big fight, because without him, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6502.780000000001s)]
*  the fight, without the opponent, the fight is not happening. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6506.22s)]
*  So he's a part of it. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6509.900000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, don't just make me look like [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6511.58s)]
*  the come, the grab and go guy. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6515.860000000001s)]
*  What is my opponent is having? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6518.3s)]
*  It's gonna be a big moment. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6519.9800000000005s)]
*  He's gonna be in the big fight, right? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6521.26s)]
*  What is it gonna be for him? [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6524.34s)]
*  So we set a minimum of two million for him. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6527.1s)]
*  Wow. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6531.9800000000005s)]
*  And again, that's a minimum. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6533.58s)]
*  If they get somebody that have a leverage [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6535.42s)]
*  to negotiate for more, then you can negotiate for more. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6539.18s)]
*  But if the guy is the guy that doesn't have a leverage, [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6543.26s)]
*  they don't just have to pressure him like, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6547.66s)]
*  oh no, you have to fight, this is an opportunity. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6549.58s)]
*  We are doing this for you. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6551.78s)]
*  No, you are doing this for money. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6552.78s)]
*  He better have his, has his own money. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6555.0199999999995s)]
*  So can we at least guarantee that for this magnitude [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6557.94s)]
*  of a fight, he will have at least two million as a person? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6562.14s)]
*  And that was something that wasn't even difficult to have [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6567.46s)]
*  because again, PFL was very open about that. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6570.22s)]
*  He was like, that's our vision for the sport. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6574.14s)]
*  Granted, we didn't have to go back and forth for that. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6578.3s)]
*  Yeah. That's amazing. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6581.74s)]
*  We didn't, that didn't take three minutes to get done. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6583.02s)]
*  Cause how much do you think an average UFC fighter's paying [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6586.78s)]
*  getting paid in the heavyweight division for a fight? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6590.74s)]
*  I don't know, I don't check their contract, bro. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6593.3s)]
*  I know how much I was making and sometimes it wasn't fun. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6595.94s)]
*  I know what I could have made, but I know that he was, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6600.5s)]
*  I have to pay another price for that. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6604.34s)]
*  What other price? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6607.38s)]
*  Contract, freedom. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6609.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6610.78s)]
*  I mean, to... [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6612.26s)]
*  So how good was the money that they were offering you [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6613.42s)]
*  to sign for the UFC? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6615.78s)]
*  He was good. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6618.74s)]
*  He was good enough, but... [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6620.62s)]
*  It's just the other parts of it. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6623.9800000000005s)]
*  The terms. Yeah. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6625.22s)]
*  A lot of... [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6626.46s)]
*  Where's the PFL getting all this money? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6627.3s)]
*  Cause they don't have a pay-per-view model. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6630.3s)]
*  So how are they getting all this money? [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6631.9s)]
*  They are setting a pay-per-view super fight, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6633.34s)]
*  super pay-per-view fight. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6635.54s)]
*  So how are you gonna be fighting? [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6636.54s)]
*  Yeah, when I fight. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6637.62s)]
*  And there's also Jake Paul that will potentially fight. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6640.14s)]
*  Yeah, in the super fight. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6643.54s)]
*  Who is he gonna fight? [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6644.86s)]
*  Cause I heard they're talking about him fighting Nate Diaz. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6646.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6649.34s)]
*  If they did that on an undercard with you, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6650.18s)]
*  that would be a big draw. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6651.38s)]
*  You know, because the boxing match was pretty close. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6653.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6656.22s)]
*  That would be massive, massive card. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6657.26s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6660.62s)]
*  I like... [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6662.42s)]
*  And I do like the PFL business model. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6664.02s)]
*  That structure as a business. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6668.22s)]
*  So... Yeah. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6671.06s)]
*  Well, my hope is that they... [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6672.26s)]
*  Well, it looks like they're buying Bellator, right? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6674.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6677.42s)]
*  I heard that. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6678.46s)]
*  Nothing has been confirmed. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6679.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know why he's taking so long. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6681.58s)]
*  We should have been hearing some news. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6684.62s)]
*  If that happens, that changes a lot. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6686.900000000001s)]
*  Cause then you get some real legit heavyweights, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6688.74s)]
*  you get some real legit lightweights, welterweights. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6690.62s)]
*  Real legit fighters. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6694.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6695.34s)]
*  Imagine the roster merge, the merging of the roster. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6696.18s)]
*  That would be very good. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6700.700000000001s)]
*  Very interesting. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6701.900000000001s)]
*  Guys like Johnny Elbin, who's high level, middleweight, [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6702.740000000001s)]
*  one of the best in the world. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6706.700000000001s)]
*  You get some really good fighters over there. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6707.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6709.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6710.58s)]
*  I like that. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6711.42s)]
*  But importantly for the fighters, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6712.26s)]
*  there needs to be competition. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6715.5s)]
*  There has to be options. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6716.860000000001s)]
*  There have to be options. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6718.38s)]
*  There has to be competition. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6719.22s)]
*  And at the end of the day, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6720.06s)]
*  the heavyweight champion of the UFC, leaving the UFC [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6721.38s)]
*  and going to the PFL is good for everybody. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6724.02s)]
*  I believe. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6726.38s)]
*  Because I believe it strengthens that organization, [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6727.3s)]
*  which strengthens the opportunities for fighters. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6729.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6733.780000000001s)]
*  And maybe open a lot of fighter eyes. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6734.62s)]
*  Because until some fighters, most fighters, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6740.42s)]
*  they have like a one sided vision. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6744.860000000001s)]
*  They don't see it. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6747.22s)]
*  They don't even know that they have other opportunities. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6748.22s)]
*  Which is like something that makes things [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6751.9400000000005s)]
*  very complicated for them. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6755.18s)]
*  Then they're just like, okay, whatever. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6756.780000000001s)]
*  What else can I do? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6759.820000000001s)]
*  I have seen people that get caught by the UFC [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6761.62s)]
*  and then they go somewhere else, whether it's in PFL. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6765.26s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, I have a, wow, I have a new life. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6768.14s)]
*  I didn't know that I could make that much money on my career. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6773.54s)]
*  I remember once I saw a tweet [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6776.94s)]
*  and that tweet stick in my mind. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6779.0199999999995s)]
*  He was from Corey Anderson. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6781.86s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6783.7s)]
*  After he left, I think he get caught or he left the UFC [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6784.54s)]
*  and then had a deal with Bellator. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6787.78s)]
*  And then he went there, he said, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6790.42s)]
*  he make a tweet like, UFC gives me a career, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6792.259999999999s)]
*  but Bellator gives me a life. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6796.0599999999995s)]
*  I love that tweet. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6797.94s)]
*  Yeah, he said he made way more money in Bellator. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6800.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6802.139999999999s)]
*  I wonder why. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6804.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, like, after this fight, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6805.34s)]
*  I'm gonna go out there, fight in the PFL [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6810.38s)]
*  and for one fight in the PFL, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6814.06s)]
*  I'm gonna be making maybe two eyes or three time [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6818.22s)]
*  what I have made in my entire career or in my entire life. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6823.34s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6827.9800000000005s)]
*  So you understand the difference between career and life. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6829.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6833.42s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6834.26s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6839.3s)]
*  Good for you, man. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6840.54s)]
*  Good for you and good for the whole sport. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6841.54s)]
*  I really believe that. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6845.3s)]
*  I really believe that all that competition [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6846.22s)]
*  is good for the sport. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6848.14s)]
*  I believe that too. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6849.18s)]
*  And I think the sport is really changing. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6850.38s)]
*  Now we get all those different organization [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6854.22s)]
*  and soon we're gonna have something in Africa, massive. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6859.3s)]
*  There's already some organization in Africa, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6865.22s)]
*  but we need to get pushed. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6867.14s)]
*  Kamaru Osman has his own organization [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6868.780000000001s)]
*  named I think African Knockout. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6871.62s)]
*  There is like some organization in South Africa, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6874.34s)]
*  somewhere else too. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6877.860000000001s)]
*  And then, yeah, but with the PFL, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6879.62s)]
*  the way that they're gonna structure, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6883.46s)]
*  the fund that they're gonna, how they're gonna fund it, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6884.9800000000005s)]
*  this is gonna be massive [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6888.26s)]
*  because we are structuring the PFL Africa [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6889.58s)]
*  as same as the PFL Europe [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6893.62s)]
*  because the PFL is having a regional PFL. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6896.42s)]
*  So every fighter from Europe, PFL fighter from Europe, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6902.14s)]
*  is fighting in the one pool to get a champion, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6907.0199999999995s)]
*  then we can fight in the PFL global. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6910.38s)]
*  In Africa, they have the same, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6913.14s)]
*  we're gonna have the same thing. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6914.7s)]
*  Whoosh, they're gonna have basically almost the same pay. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6916.46s)]
*  And when you think about the currency, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6921.58s)]
*  it's make this in Africa like massive, massive economy, [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6923.98s)]
*  investment in the economy [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6929.38s)]
*  because those guy gonna have money [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6931.219999999999s)]
*  and they're gonna start think about [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6933.66s)]
*  how they train properly, where would they train with, [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6935.26s)]
*  they're gonna finance, they're gonna pay people around them [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6938.5s)]
*  and business gonna grow around it [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6941.46s)]
*  and help infrastructure taking off and those things. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6943.98s)]
*  I'm very excited about it. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6949.38s)]
*  And the reason why is because like sometimes [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6951.62s)]
*  I wanna train whom and then I realize [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6954.34s)]
*  I can't have even a sparring partner, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6958.54s)]
*  a legit sparring partner [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6962.34s)]
*  because they don't even have where to train. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6963.82s)]
*  They haven't been training properly. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6966.179999999999s)]
*  They don't have a high competition. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6968.34s)]
*  They don't have staff like that. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6970.38s)]
*  So they can dedicate their time that much for training [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6971.58s)]
*  rather than go working to provide for their family. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6976.34s)]
*  But if they were able to dedicate all their time [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6980.74s)]
*  for training, how would that look like? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6984.34s)]
*  I might just as well move home in a couple years [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6988.06s)]
*  and just chill and have my set my training camp here. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6991.46s)]
*  Set something like what you did here in Africa. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6996.62s)]
*  Yeah, and just sit there, have my camp, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=6999.46s)]
*  have my training partners at home, enjoying it from there. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7002.66s)]
*  And what an inspiration that would be for them. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7007.7s)]
*  So young fighters that don't know, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7009.9s)]
*  am I ever gonna have a future? [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7012.3s)]
*  And then someone comes from Cameroon, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7013.9s)]
*  goes to the UFC, becomes a champ, goes to the PFL, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7015.9s)]
*  fights Tyson Fury and then comes back to Africa [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7019.14s)]
*  and trains with everybody. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7022.099999999999s)]
*  I'm back already. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7023.34s)]
*  It's not like after fight Tyson Fury, I'm back. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7024.5s)]
*  I have a foundation, I have a gym there. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7027.38s)]
*  We just opened the second location. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7029.94s)]
*  In Douala, and this is a massive facility. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7032.9800000000005s)]
*  That's awesome. That's beautiful. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7036.42s)]
*  Yes, we were helped by a betting company [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7038.38s)]
*  named Premier Bet that helped us build this massive, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1VAZy7eLLc&t=7041.66s)]
