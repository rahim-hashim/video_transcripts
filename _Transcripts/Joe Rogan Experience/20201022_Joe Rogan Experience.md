# Joe Rogan Experience #1552 - Matthew McConaughey
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 22, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBCl9A9NlRw)
*  Hello Matthew.
*  Hello Joe.
*  What's going on man?
*  Got a book out?
*  Got a book out.
*  Got green lights.
*  Trying to catch them.
*  What makes a guy who is successful as you as an actor, what makes you want to expose
*  more of yourself?
*  Because that's kind of what you're doing by writing a memoir, right?
*  You're exposing your thought process, your life, your lessons.
*  Another way of communicating.
*  What I do, my day job as an actor, it's got four filters from the raw expression.
*  There's my raw expression, there is what's being recorded, there's what's being edited
*  and there's what's being put on the screen.
*  I wanted to do something where I got rid of the filters.
*  Writing a book, there is one filter because it's the written word.
*  What you do, what we're doing now, when you do stand up, that's no filters.
*  That's the direct, it's live.
*  The big show is always recording, sort of ultimate goal.
*  But I wanted to put it down and say, hey, I'm part of these movies.
*  They're usually written by somebody else, directed by somebody else, edited by someone
*  else, financed by someone else.
*  I was like, no, I want to go direct my own movie.
*  I want to produce my own movie.
*  How do I do that?
*  I want to put the words on a page.
*  I'd been writing for 36 years, so I had a lot of content to go through and see if it
*  was something worthy of sharing.
*  You've been keeping a journal for 36 years?
*  What made you start doing that?
*  I think probably in the beginning, the usual reason someone writes in a journal.
*  My heart's broken, Gretchen Donnelly broke up with me.
*  Why do I have all these pimples on my face?
*  Why do I only have peach fuzz over my pecker and everyone else has peckers?
*  And then in my early 20s, I remember I was kind of rolling.
*  I was in college, I had a job, I had money in my pocket, I had a nice girlfriend, I'm
*  making my grades, my relationships were good.
*  And I remember going, oh, you hadn't been writing in your journal in years much.
*  Notice you don't do that so much, Donnelly, when things are going well.
*  I said, I think you better start writing down things when things are going well.
*  My idea was that, hey, you're going to get in a rut again, you'll lose your frequency
*  again in life.
*  You might want this to go back and look at to help you recalibrate.
*  And that proved to be true.
*  So many times we dissect failure and hardships, but we don't dissect success.
*  And going back in those journals, I found that there were times when I got in a rut
*  later and I was able to go back to those journals and go, what were your habits when you were
*  rolling, man?
*  Who were you hanging out with?
*  Where were you going?
*  What were you eating?
*  What were you drinking?
*  How much sleep were you getting?
*  How are you looking at life?
*  And they helped me recalibrate in the times when I was off frequency and get back on the
*  rails again and find my frequency again.
*  What were the things that when things were going great, what were the common factors?
*  Common factors were one, check in with yourself before checking in with the world when you
*  wake up in the morning.
*  Really just sit there and take a little time.
*  Read a little something that's between me and me.
*  Write a little something that's between me and me before picking up the damn phone and
*  saying, hey, what emails came in or hopping out in the kitchen and going, and everyone
*  else is already up going, hey, hey, what's up?
*  Take take take take 10 minutes to check in with me before checking in with the world.
*  What were the other things?
*  Sense of humor.
*  Sense of humor.
*  I found that I was laughing more.
*  Happiest time of my life when I got my wink back, man, when I got my wink, if I lose my
*  wink, it's like, oh, I'm taking things too seriously.
*  So I had more of a sense of humor.
*  Didn't take things as personal in many ways and wasn't asking permission as much when
*  I was rolling.
*  Asking permission.
*  Like, what do you mean by that?
*  Well, just ask permission about having the confidence to believe in something I want
*  to do and just doing it and saying, hey, if you ask permission, you're already creating
*  one of those filters away from the raw expression.
*  Just do it.
*  It's live.
*  Don't.
*  You can.
*  What you're saying, what it sounds like is like you almost like self medicated with a
*  type of medication or a type of meditation that you invented yourself.
*  You almost like figured out a meditation.
*  Because that's what people who meditate, that's what they say to do.
*  Take an X amount of time, 10, 20, whatever it is, minutes out of the day, focus on your
*  breathing, clean the mind out of anxiety and stress.
*  And if you do that on a regular basis, you'll have a happier life.
*  And you seem to have figured that out on your own?
*  Or did you read books about doing this?
*  I think I figured it out on my own.
*  I mean, the other thing that I didn't tell you was to book in the day before I say my
*  prayers at night to go through the day, which I don't know about you, but it can be hard
*  to remember what you had for breakfast after dinner when you're going to bed.
*  It can be hard to remember what those first things we did in the day.
*  So I'll go back through my day when I'm happiest.
*  I go back to my day.
*  And I like to write a mental note of what is tomorrow.
*  What are my plans for tomorrow?
*  That's a big stress reliever for me.
*  I think I learned it on my own.
*  I've always been a list keeper.
*  I love making long list of things to do during the day.
*  And I add everything.
*  I add the simple things that you know you're going to do anyway in the list.
*  You know, like kiss your wife.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Drop a deuce, whatever it is.
*  I write things that I'm going to do just so it's more to mark off the list.
*  You write down you have to take a shit?
*  Really?
*  Just remember.
*  You know, enjoy that or read something funny or have a listen to that favorite tune of
*  yours.
*  Something that I know because the longer the list, the more things I can mark off that
*  day, the more I feel like I accomplished and the more it makes it kind of easy to do the
*  hard stuff.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, I do that with some things that I have to do like exercise and writing.
*  I do that with some things.
*  But it seems like you're very meticulous with this.
*  Yeah, I go through hot streaks and cold streaks on it.
*  I do it more times than others.
*  But I've found that those are the common denominators, some of the things I do when I am the most
*  happy.
*  I'm not a big meditator, but my exercise I call breaking a sweat once a day.
*  Exercising, I find for me that is necessary because it puts a demarcation between all
*  of my responsibilities.
*  And I can sometimes look up.
*  You know how it is.
*  Sometimes you go through the day or days and you're so busy.
*  I'm good on autopilot at getting stuff done, but everything you have to do, stress comes
*  when those responsibilities feel like they're stacked vertically on our shoulders.
*  And there's a proverbial weight on our shoulders.
*  When I go break a sweat, all of a sudden all those things that were stacked vertically
*  on my shoulders, my responsibilities lay down and they're laterally out in front of me.
*  So there's no more weight on my shoulder.
*  And I find that I get those things done better and with more enjoyment.
*  If I just go, oh, there they are in front of you.
*  If I just handle one, then hop to the next one and handle that.
*  Then hop to the next one and handle that.
*  Handle it much more better.
*  But I need those, I see demarcations between my responsibilities if I go break a sweat.
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more with that.
*  I think there's a biological need for that when human beings are under pressure.
*  Because I think the way our bodies are set up, pressure historically, genetically meant
*  your life was in danger and you had to exert energy and your body stored up this energy.
*  You had adrenaline rushes, you had anxiety, you had all these different physical needs
*  that you had to take care of.
*  And if you don't exert energy, those physical needs are not met and your body's confused.
*  It stores up a lot of this and you just get anxious, you yell at red lights and people
*  just freak out.
*  Generally, your tolerance for bullshit is way lower.
*  But if you can just get that physical need taken care of, you're way better at handling
*  life.
*  Way better.
*  Yeah, I couldn't tell people that enough.
*  I'm a broken record with it.
*  I say it too much.
*  And I love hearing people like yourself, successful people that have thought about a lot of the
*  various aspects of what's good and bad about their life express that.
*  Because I think everyone needs to hear it.
*  We need to hear it from enough people so that it just becomes ingrained in everyone's head.
*  Every day, brush your teeth, every day, break a sweat.
*  It's good to do it.
*  I mean, it's good for so many things.
*  People talk about, oh, no stress.
*  I'm like, well, bullshit.
*  Stress is part of life.
*  It means you give a damn.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You're going to have stress.
*  You're supposed to have stress.
*  But I know I handle things better and more thoroughly and more like myself, like I want
*  to.
*  The outcome is always better and I enjoy doing it more if I do go break that sweat and get
*  those endorphins going.
*  That presses reset for me and shows me a little it separates all the events, like I said,
*  laterally and they don't feel like they're stacked up on top of me.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, sleep for me.
*  How much do you get a night?
*  Nine and a half.
*  Woo.
*  I love it.
*  That's great.
*  I wish I could do that.
*  God damn.
*  When I get a nine and a half hour night.
*  Oh my God, I feel so good the next day.
*  I feel amazing.
*  I feel like a newer person.
*  Well, I'm lucky I have a wife that says, no, no, no, you get your nine and a half.
*  I'll get my seven because I'd rather handle the stuff I handle that you don't while you're
*  sleeping than be around you when you hadn't had enough sleep.
*  Well you said it up right.
*  Yeah, I can't stress that enough to sleep is everything.
*  Sleep exercise, health, keep the body functioning correctly.
*  All those things.
*  It's not a vanity thing and it's not a laziness thing.
*  It's literally like it improves the quality of the way the mind functions and you get
*  better things done.
*  The quality of your work will be better.
*  Definitely.
*  Think more clearly.
*  You don't waste your time chasing down bullshit.
*  You do the right kind of work.
*  We all know that.
*  I love hard work, but I've got many times in my life where I'm doing the wrong kind
*  of work.
*  I love the kind of work where I've accomplished what I needed to do during the day and I lay
*  my head on the pillow and I'm exhausted because I got done what I needed to get done as best
*  I could.
*  I do not like the exhaustion at the end of the day where I'm like, man, I feel like I
*  was just going to revolutions, man.
*  I don't know if today had any ascension to it.
*  I didn't build anything.
*  Today was a, I don't know if I, maybe I went backwards.
*  I don't like that kind of exhaustion.
*  And that's the kind of exhaustion that actually I don't go to sleep well.
*  It actually keeps me up.
*  The only thing I get good out of those shitty days is a desire to never have those shitty
*  days again.
*  I think that the good aspects of negative feelings is recognizing how good positive
*  feelings are, how good the feelings of accomplishment are by failing.
*  And that's why we're talking about, you know, like no stress, just live in peace.
*  That's a crock of shit.
*  That's like never feel bad.
*  Well, then you're never going to appreciate feeling good.
*  Like we need hills and valleys.
*  I'm with you 100% on that.
*  I mean, I write my book, you know, and I get asked a lot, do you believe in fear?
*  I'm like, well, hell yeah.
*  I believe in fear.
*  Who the fuck doesn't believe in fear?
*  We know you see those like no fear.
*  Oh, those people are so silly.
*  Like, no, no, no, no, no.
*  I do. And they're like, do you fear?
*  I said, I fear every single day.
*  It's the overcoming of the fear or I know being raised.
*  You know, we were a physical discipline family.
*  We got that we got the belt.
*  We didn't get grounded.
*  My parents motto was we're not going to ground you because that takes away your time.
*  And your time is your most valuable thing.
*  Now, we never got injured.
*  We just get hurt at the time you cried and it was over with.
*  But there were things that I did not do growing up and still do not do for fear of the
*  consequences that works for me going.
*  I wrote time things I did not do growing up going like, no, that'd be a lot of fun, but
*  not so much, not more fun than how much it's going to suck if I get caught.
*  Physical consequences are it's a very controversial subject because a lot of people think I
*  don't hit my kids, but a lot of people that I know who are my age were hit when they were
*  young and they look back on it and they say, you know what I learned from that.
*  And my parents didn't they didn't beat me.
*  They physically punished me for something that I did wrong.
*  And they didn't do it to be sadistic.
*  They did it because they cared about me and that's how they were raised.
*  It's a very controversial subject because people get up in arms with the idea of hitting
*  children. You know, so you bring it up that it was beneficial to you is going to have
*  a lot of people's hackles raised.
*  Sure. And I get asked all the time and I've shared it openly how I was raised and what
*  kind of corporal punishment we got.
*  I don't choose to discipline my children the same way my parents did.
*  But I've said this before, I wouldn't trade one single of those ass whoppers I got for
*  the values that were instilled in me from getting them.
*  And I'm very clear and was at the time that I earned every one I got.
*  I earned every one.
*  And we were a family, you know, my parents were like, we get it over with and over take
*  it and it's over and we don't hold grudges.
*  No one's going to speak of it again.
*  And if you got in trouble, that was the night dad would take us across town to our favorite
*  burger joint and let us stay as late as we wanted.
*  It was and it was over.
*  You got in more trouble if you brought something back up to somebody in the family.
*  Yeah. But what about when you do that?
*  No, no, no. They already got in trouble for that.
*  You don't bring it back up. You could not go to sleep in our family holding a grudge.
*  My parents would stay up all night and let you miss school to sit there and keep hashing
*  out until we could hug it out, cry it out and say I love you and move on.
*  Sounds like you had a wise family.
*  I mean, it's a controversial thing to say if they hit you.
*  A lot of people would say there's other ways to do it.
*  But the way they made you hug it out and stay up all night and communicate, it sounds
*  very wise.
*  I think it was, you know, I don't, you know, like I said, I don't choose to discipline
*  my kids the way my parents discipline me, but I damn sure don't judge them or say what
*  they did was wrong.
*  Well, they came from a different era as well, right?
*  Yeah, they did come from a different era.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the thing that is very difficult for people to come to grips with is that, you
*  know, human beings that were raised 30, 40, 50, 60 years ago, they it was a different
*  world. It just was different.
*  And we know more now.
*  And like you're saying, you do not choose to discipline your children that way.
*  But it was so common back then.
*  It was, yeah, I mean, it was, you know, my parents were probably thought they were taking
*  it easy on their boys more than their parents treated them.
*  Yeah, they probably had it much more harsh.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and it's like I said, there are things I did not do that I should not have
*  done for fear, getting my backside.
*  So there's value in that in that fear and consequences and consequences go both ways.
*  You know, there's going to the back of the head.
*  There's a consequence for everything we do.
*  But there were definitely things I didn't do that I should not have done for the fear,
*  the consequences that were useful to me.
*  Is this the writing of this book?
*  Is some of it almost like.
*  Like letters to your younger self, like a lesson to people who are like you coming up?
*  Because one of the things that's so beneficial to young people with reading autobiographies
*  and memoirs of successful people that lived extraordinary lives is you get to see all
*  the thought process.
*  You get to see the warts, the failures, the whole thing, the fears, the anxiety.
*  You get to see it all.
*  So you go, oh, that Matthew McConaughey guy, he's a normal dude.
*  He's not just the guy from Dallas Buyers Club and all these movies.
*  He's a normal human being.
*  He's a normal human being.
*  And maybe I can one day achieve heights like him as well.
*  Or maybe I read this book and I'm someone who feels like, you know, as we often do when
*  we're going through a crisis, that we're the only ones and it's only happened to me.
*  I'm the center of the universe.
*  No one else will understand.
*  And you can read and go, well, here's a guy who's successful, who, shoot, I even maybe
*  thought he just kind of rolls out of bed and makes everything look easy, which you find
*  I try to work to get to that point.
*  But maybe you look and you hear it and you go, oh, he went through some similar things.
*  I share some stories in here that are very subjective to me.
*  But the more subjective and personal I got, the more I found that, oh, these are more
*  relatable to the more amount of people out there.
*  So you may read a story and go, I have that story, a similar story in my life.
*  Well, here's how McConaughey handled it or wished he would have handled it.
*  Or here's some help he got along the way.
*  Here's somewhere where he he took a walk about with himself and found out some things
*  about himself. Maybe that's something I could do for myself.
*  So there are some tools in the book for someone to see themselves in and help navigate
*  our way out of crisis.
*  Red and yellow lights. But also how to navigate things when we are catching green lights,
*  because I have a chapter here called The Art of Running Downhill.
*  You know, I self-sabotage myself and things were going too well before
*  until I learned that that really wasn't my right to put a roof over my expectations
*  for myself and who the hell did I think I was?
*  Well, that's more common than not, isn't it?
*  There's the people get what they call imposter syndrome.
*  You know, it's you don't feel like you deserve all the good things that are happening
*  to you. And it just seems odd.
*  You see it happen to other people.
*  It almost makes sense. You see other people being very successful.
*  You're detached. But when it's happening to you, it's almost like this.
*  This is uncomfortable because this is not normal.
*  And so I'm going to fuck this up so that I feel like I used to feel before,
*  which at least even if it was failure, it's comfortable.
*  I'm accustomed to it.
*  I need some resistance.
*  Yes.
*  You know, and look, and I think there's very healthy ways to create resistance
*  in our lives when we are on so-called easy street.
*  Yeah.
*  That may be challenging ourselves in the right way, you know, that we need to create
*  resistance to overcome it, to feel most alive.
*  But there's also foolish times to create resistance.
*  And the fact of that is things are going so well, you think that's how it's going to be
*  for the rest of your life. No, trust me, the uphill is coming.
*  The drama, the real drama is coming.
*  Don't create any false drama in front of you right now because you're kind of patronizing
*  yourself. The real drama is going to come.
*  Someone is going to get sick.
*  You are going to get hurt.
*  Something will happen in your life.
*  The world will do unto you or you'll do it unto yourself.
*  So don't trip yourself running downhill and face plant and break your frickin nose just
*  because you needed some resistance running downhill.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that uphill is coming.
*  You know what I mean? But to go like the first part of that, I'm a big fan of creating
*  resistance to keep myself in check and to make sure that I'm feeling most alive to
*  overcome the right things in my life.
*  Yeah, me as well.
*  I find physical resistance is the best thing to calm my mind and to provide physical
*  challenges that allow me to it allows me to deal with success easier because there's
*  bullshit that I have to deal with.
*  But the bullshit is physical.
*  And it sometimes is challenging mentally to do very physically exerting exercises or
*  particularly jujitsu or martial arts because it just breaks you down.
*  And so then the other stuff that's sort of it seems like it should be complicated, but
*  it's not. You don't know why.
*  You don't sweat it as much.
*  But it sobers you up.
*  Yes.
*  In a very literal way.
*  And in the same way, it's a daily routine to sober yourself up, to throw off the
*  mendacious bullshit in your life that you were so concerned about and get down to what
*  really needs to happen.
*  Mountains become molehills.
*  You know, it's big moments in our life sober us up, too.
*  I know my father moving on and passing on from this life sobered me up in a way that
*  I then stepped up and said, oh, you don't have your dad to rely on anymore to catch
*  you when you fall.
*  All these things he's been teaching you that you've been kind of making B minuses in
*  life. Now you better start making A's at him because he's not there.
*  So you better take some ownership.
*  And I remember when he moved on, I carved this in a tree, be less impressed, more
*  involved. And what it was as soon as he passed away, I noticed that all the things that
*  I was revering in life mortally, like the fame, people that success money, they
*  lowered down to eye level things that I was looking up at and all the things that I was
*  patronizing and condescending and going, oh, sloughing off, that's not worthy of me.
*  They rose up to eye level.
*  And I remember saying, boy, the world is flat.
*  I'm looking at it in the eye.
*  I see further. I see wider.
*  I see clearer.
*  I've got to take ownership of myself.
*  And I stood with my heart higher.
*  I stood with my head higher and I walked forward and started doing things in that way
*  that I was saying, without asking so much permission all the time and got a lot more
*  done and became a lot more myself and found more satisfaction.
*  Yeah, sometimes people do need some wake up call to let you know that this is a
*  temporary existence and make the best out of it and enjoy it.
*  And sometimes it doesn't happen unless something tragic happens like they are in a
*  terrible way, but also a beautiful way.
*  There's a lot of power in tragedy because you get something on the other end of it
*  and you get clarity.
*  We will get some clarity out of this tragic and awkward time of covid.
*  Yes, there are lessons we're learning that we don't even know what they are right
*  now, that when we get out of it, we'll inherently be part of our being that we'll
*  go forward. I sure as hell hope so.
*  But you know, us humans were quick to snap right back to how we were before.
*  Yeah, my concern is that it's happening so fast, but it's going to take a long time
*  to sort of even out and for us to reach equilibrium.
*  That's what I'm worried about with this.
*  Wait, that what's happening?
*  So the deterioration that, you know, the financial deterioration, the fear, the
*  changes with the masks and the social distancing and everything is happening so
*  fast, I'm worried it's just going to take a long time for people feel comfortable
*  again.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, look, I think for millions of people, this is the new normal.
*  I think I don't think we're ever really going back to how it was.
*  I mean, this is a year that agree or disagree with how we've gone about it and
*  how things have been politicized here and there.
*  This is a year that have shaken our floor.
*  I don't believe this is ever this year is going to be on page 14 of the news for
*  quite some time.
*  I think we've got a lot of rebuilding to do in the long term.
*  It may be a 20 year build.
*  Yeah, no, I agree.
*  It's it's just strange.
*  It just feels strange.
*  You go outside, the world just feels different than it felt a year ago.
*  And that's that phrase, the new normal that people like to bring up.
*  And this is this is where we find ourselves.
*  But I, along with you, I'm I'm almost always optimistic and I have a lot of
*  faith in human beings.
*  And I think that we can get through this and have a very valuable lesson about
*  when things do happen that are positive and good, maybe we won't take it for
*  granted as much as we did before, because we never thought that something like
*  this was ever going to come along where the whole world was going to shut down
*  for seven, eight, nine, ten, who knows how many months.
*  Yeah, forced winter.
*  Yeah, we had first upon us in something that we don't take enough time to force
*  upon ourselves and choose upon ourselves to do.
*  You know, you talked about optimism, which I'd love to open that up with you
*  and faith in mankind.
*  And I was asked the other day about how do I trust?
*  And this is a time in the world where there's great distrust and people don't
*  believe you don't just trust it.
*  You don't you don't trust others.
*  You end up not trusting yourself, etc.
*  That reciprocity goes back and forth and then everyone's walking in circles.
*  But my answer, and I never thought about it until this guy asked me, so I was like,
*  well, like I'm talking to you right now, Joe, I give you you have 100 percent
*  of my trust until you don't.
*  I'm not coming in hedging my bet with you or anyone that I meet for the first time.
*  I'm not coming in like, well, you're going to have to really earn your trust with me.
*  I'm looking out for you.
*  No, you have 100 percent.
*  You may ask me some questions right now that I'm like, oh, and I think he's getting
*  at something else that's not really in my best interest.
*  And maybe then you start losing some of my trust.
*  But as of right now, we meet you have 100 percent until it starts to decrease.
*  And that's all that's up to you.
*  I try to go towards everybody like that first.
*  So how is that?
*  And let's talk about optimism because there's foolish optimism.
*  There's like and I don't think what you and I are saying is, hey.
*  Class half full, always see it half full.
*  No, let's recognize that it's half empty.
*  That's the inevitable part.
*  It's half empty or it's half full.
*  Now, what's the constructive way forward?
*  What can you do something with the half the glass?
*  Got nothing in it or half that's got something in it?
*  Well, I think what I can do is with the half that's got something in it, make something
*  here, irrigate something, create more water so I can fill it up.
*  I mean, it's choosing where can we be constructive and in the after
*  choose the affirmative.
*  And that's not a foolish optimism because a lot of times I think certain optimisms,
*  Hallmark card optimisms can almost deny that there was the other half of glass
*  that was empty or deny it's a problem.
*  And I'm not into I'm not really a purchaser of denying where there's a problem.
*  You've got you've got what I call whiskey philosopher wisdom.
*  Like if you and I were having a couple of drinks at the bar, I have a feeling you
*  would say some cool shit that I would remember and I would take home and I'd go,
*  hmm, I'd be like lying in bed going, I'm going to remember that.
*  That makes a lot of sense.
*  Where'd you get that from?
*  Ah, I think I mean, I grew up and found the storytellers.
*  I love I love bumper stickers.
*  I love slogans.
*  I love to deconstruct a big conversation down to what's a one liner?
*  What's the title of that song we just sang?
*  What's the title of this, you know, this hour or whatever you and I talk?
*  What's the title of a relationship I have?
*  What's the and you get enough of those things.
*  Oh, what's the album title?
*  That's I think of things lyrically.
*  And I think that may be where it comes from, as I think in a musical in a musical
*  way.
*  Is this something you've acquired?
*  Is this something you always had or you just sort of slowly developed it?
*  I think I'm guessing it was slowly developed.
*  I mean, again, I come from a from a family of storytellers where we sat around the
*  table and told stories.
*  And if you didn't tell your story, good somebody else at the table took it over
*  and speak up.
*  You better be telling a good story and not dragging on or losing your train of
*  thought, because somebody else will step in and roll over you.
*  So when you wanted to get a word in, you better be a good storyteller.
*  Is that how you got into acting?
*  Like this, the ability to entertain because the storyteller is essentially an
*  entertainer.
*  Sure.
*  Well, I went to film school first because when I look back at the diaries, I
*  really couldn't admit that I wanted to be in front of the camera as an actor.
*  But that's what I really wanted to do.
*  But I went to film school because I felt like being the storyteller behind the
*  camera was something that my dad, one could digest as a possible route forward
*  for his son.
*  And it was all that I could digest at the time.
*  So when I made the leap to film school, I immediately would direct actors by
*  performing myself in front of the camera.
*  So I really liked the first person subjective performance.
*  And then I got that job in that summer of 92 on days confused where I ended up
*  three lines turned into three weeks work.
*  I'm getting paid 320 bucks a day.
*  People tell me I'm good at it.
*  I keep getting invited back to set.
*  I'm like, is this fucking legal?
*  And so I went back, graduated, picked up my packed up my U-haul and drove West
*  Young man, you know, two weeks out of out of graduating college.
*  And, um, you know, I didn't have that story of roughing it when I first got out
*  there. First two auditions I went on, I got the job.
*  That's pretty fucking amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you, when you, when you say that you didn't want to admit that you wanted to
*  be in front of the camera, like what do you think was holding you back?
*  I think it was the idea.
*  Look, I was raised in a blue collar family where you get a job, you work your way
*  up the ladder company ladder to be in the arts, to be in front of the camera.
*  The actor sounded so vain.
*  Sounded so avant-garde, sounded so European, sounded so, so, so nothing stable
*  about it.
*  And so to bring that up to my dad, even bring it up, like I said, I could, it
*  was not even in the vernacular of my dreams.
*  I did not even dream about it.
*  The only place that I admitted it was in my diaries.
*  And I found those where I wrote to myself before I even consciously admit it, that
*  I did want to be an actor all the way back since 1988, but I never admitted it
*  until I started doing it.
*  And it was turned into about 1993 that I was like, okay, I think I can do this.
*  I'm giving it a shot and I love this.
*  Um, it's totally understandable that you would fall into some form of self
*  sabotage if it came that easy.
*  If all of a sudden you're on Daze and Confused, all of a sudden you do your
*  first two auditions, you get the gig.
*  Everything's rolling.
*  You're young and handsome.
*  Whoa.
*  Come on.
*  Dream nights.
*  I mean, how did you self-correct?
*  Tell you what I did.
*  I, uh, I got, it really happened around 96 after I did a film with Time to Kill.
*  I remember the Friday before Time to Kill opened.
*  That's the movie that, that, that I was the lead in a big budget John Grisha movie.
*  That was the one that made me famous.
*  All right.
*  So the Friday before that movie opened, I, you know, there's a
*  hundred scripts I wanted to do.
*  I would have done anything to do any of these scripts.
*  99, no, you can't.
*  One, yes, you can.
*  I'm walking down the third street promenade in Santa Monica, 400 people
*  on the promenade, 396 minding their own business, four of them checking me out.
*  Two girls that thought I was cute and a couple other people maybe like my shoes.
*  The Monday following that weekend, Time to Kill opens that night.
*  The Monday following, all of a sudden out of those hundred scripts, 99 yeses.
*  You can do any of these, Matthew.
*  One no.
*  All of a sudden that same promenade walk I took 400 people.
*  Now 396 were staring at me and four people weren't, one of them was blind.
*  All right.
*  They, it was, it inverted.
*  The world became a mirror.
*  I noticed, Oh shit.
*  I don't need any strangers anymore.
*  People are coming up to me going like, I'm so sorry about Ms.
*  Hud and I'm going, wait a minute.
*  Number one, what's your name?
*  I've never met you.
*  How'd you know I had a dog whose name is Ms.
*  Hud and has cancer.
*  You just skipped five filters of howdy.
*  You know what I mean?
*  And I remember feeling unbalanced about it.
*  How old?
*  I'm 23 at that time.
*  I'm being told, I love you.
*  I love you.
*  And in my mind, I'm going, man, we don't throw that word around.
*  I've said that to four people in my life.
*  Uh, so I wanted to know what the heck was real, what really mattered.
*  And I was looking for a place to go.
*  I needed to get out.
*  I needed to go those demarcations.
*  We talked about earlier.
*  I needed to go break a long sweat.
*  I needed to go out and let memory catch up and see what the hell was real.
*  What was not.
*  So I packed up my stuff.
*  Um, I went to a monastery for about a week and then I got back and I went off.
*  I had this certain dream, a repeating dream that came to me.
*  And I went to Peru and flooded the Amazon for 22 days.
*  And it was a forced solitude.
*  Nobody there knew my name.
*  They didn't speak English.
*  I was forced to be with myself and my thoughts in my own company, which I was not enjoying.
*  So after about 12 days of shaking the monkeys off my back, figuring out what the
*  hell I was going to forgive myself for and what I was going to lay down the hammer
*  and say, enough's enough about.
*  Um, I came out of it, woke up one morning light as a feather and shook hands with
*  myself and said, we're going to be all right, man.
*  Uh, you're the one person I can't get rid of McConaughey.
*  So we might as well get along and reentered.
*  And that recalibration helped a lot to disseminate through all the bullshit and
*  all the excess of affluence that was coming at me at the time.
*  And I found some discernment, you know, I found some discrimination in my choices again.
*  Um, and moved on from there, but I've had to do that.
*  I've had to take off on my own many times to go recalibrate.
*  That sounds like a story of a man running and the rocks fall right behind him.
*  Like you just missed it.
*  Like also 23 years old, you weren't a child star, but it was damn close.
*  Like we all know what happens when your personality develops in the spotlight and
*  then you're famous, almost no one gets out alive.
*  I mean, and I understand it.
*  I, I, I wasn't ready to go out to Hollywood before I did.
*  Hollywood's not a place to go find yourself.
*  Hollywood's a place where you can be anything you want.
*  It's infinite.
*  Yeses.
*  Well, in the infinite yeses, as you know, the infinite options can
*  make a tyrant of any of us.
*  What is that noise that keeps going off?
*  Is that on your end?
*  That's on my end.
*  What is that?
*  I think it's emails coming in.
*  It's a crazy ding.
*  Ding.
*  Sign it.
*  Is that what you get when you get emails?
*  That would annoy the fuck out of me.
*  What yours do?
*  Nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  I don't, I checked them once a day.
*  Oh, see, I don't text.
*  You know, I don't tell, I like to email more than text because I can press, I
*  can flag an email, I can't flag a text.
*  I wish texts would allow me to flag it.
*  Oh, I'm going to save that to answer it later.
*  And if I would just do text, I may forget you wrote.
*  And then two weeks later go, I never wrote him back.
*  Right.
*  I do that.
*  Where's my deal?
*  At least it doesn't go ding.
*  There's, I don't know.
*  Maybe Jodie Foster made it out alive.
*  She might be the only, I mean, you worked with her.
*  Did she, did she make it out alive of being a child fame?
*  She made it out alive.
*  You know, she was, yeah, she was, when she, the Coppertone girl on the beach.
*  She was a bunch of things.
*  She, she wasn't in, she in taxi driver.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, man, she did.
*  You know, who else did Ron Howard?
*  Yes, he did.
*  He's a very nice guy.
*  I ran into him at a doctor's office.
*  He couldn't have been nicer and more normal and really enjoyed talking to him.
*  Yeah.
*  Solid.
*  Um, you know, but I don't know, I've never talked to them about how they
*  navigated in their youth.
*  They obviously had some support because, you know, I see the, I see parents with
*  their, with their children and they want them to be in front of the camera.
*  And I've even seen some set that we worked with and the mothers behind the
*  camera, like Olin Mills photography going cheese, say cheese and the director.
*  You go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is not Olin Mills.
*  We just want the child to be himself or herself.
*  If they have the confidence to be themselves in front of camera, don't be
*  acting like in the thing.
*  This is not a Olin Mills photo shoot.
*  Um, and so a lot of times I've seen the parents, they're the ones that actually
*  need the recalibration to go, whoa, don't be, you're making your child doesn't
*  know who he or she is yet.
*  And yet you're forcing them to try and be someone else and that's their reality.
*  There's danger in that.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  No, there really is.
*  It's, it's very unfortunate when you see that.
*  Um, you've worked with kids that have had to play your kid.
*  Like, is that, is that feel conflicted to you when that happens?
*  Like you almost like don't want them to do it.
*  No, I, I, that's been some of my most comfortable roles as playing a father
*  or a father figure, and I think that's because the one thing I always knew I
*  wanted to be in life was a father.
*  I knew that since I was eight years old.
*  What I mean is for the children themselves.
*  Like, do you feel weird for them?
*  No, no.
*  The kids that are playing your child, like knowing that they're going to be in a
*  film at a really young age and they're going to experience all this.
*  Um, I mean, I'll check in with, you know, again, what I've noticed is it's the
*  parent that may need the recalibration.
*  The kids should, but then you see the, the mother or the father loving it more
*  than they're loving it or loving that child.
*  Is it from the camera?
*  We could be famous.
*  Well, you know, when I can, I'm trying to talk about.
*  Are your values in line here?
*  Because you're your son or daughter's future and who they are is
*  depending on how you deal with it.
*  I've also seen parents handle it really, really well.
*  Um, you're going, you're going to work.
*  You have a job to do.
*  Um, if you have a talent to do that, but you still come home and you still do the
*  chores and you're still my son or my daughter who acts just like you do.
*  And we don't do any of that other, that BS, you're not, things aren't
*  hanging around here and you don't want to steal.
*  I wouldn't want, uh, I wouldn't want my child to be raised in Hollywood by Hollywood.
*  I now, you know, early in my career, I was like, no, I would never want my kids.
*  If I have them doing what I do, I've completely turned to 180 on that.
*  Um, I would love if my kids got into the industry that I'm in.
*  It's been great to me.
*  I've met some of the most creative, awesome people in my life, but there's a time.
*  I wouldn't want them to go find out who they are in a Hollywood, in the
*  Hollywood game by being an actor or that kind of story.
*  Tell your own, I want them to know their own story first before they're going
*  to go tell someone else's story.
*  Yeah.
*  I've likened it to like almost like a chemical process.
*  Like if you want to make epoxy, you have to add a bunch of different ingredients.
*  And if you don't add the ingredients while you're mixing it up, it'll never be
*  sure it'll never really firm up.
*  It'll never be complete.
*  And I feel like that's one of the things that happens to a lot of child actors.
*  Like the experience of people not knowing who you are, you have to earn their
*  respect, you have to earn their love, earn their friendship, prove yourself,
*  not have people love you before you even meet them.
*  That's just, that seems toxic for children.
*  It just seems crazy.
*  I think it is highly toxic.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, we started off the conversation on this topic, two minutes ago,
*  not many have recovered.
*  No, not many.
*  From that, the insecurity, the lack of knowing who they are, the lack of,
*  talk about resistance, you know, Hollywood's a place of yes.
*  Yes, of course you can be whatever you want.
*  It's Halloween every day.
*  Now, wait a minute.
*  If you're playing dress up every day and you have the option to be
*  whoever the heck you want and you know, you want to go to the club all night.
*  Uh, you can do that too.
*  Everything's a yes in those infinite.
*  Yeses.
*  You can get lost and not found.
*  Um, yeah, I think they, you know, you gotta have some
*  structure.
*  And like I said, I went out at 22, 23.
*  I don't think I was ready to go out there before I went out there.
*  Cause I had a sense if I didn't as much as I had a sense of who I was, I had a
*  very clear sense of who I was not.
*  Um, and that helped me because I was able to see some things and be invited to
*  some things and be around some place.
*  So I was like, you know what, this is a stop, not a stay for me.
*  This isn't really going to feed me and really turn me on.
*  This is a short term.
*  Uh, um, you know, something I'm getting that's feeding me in the short term,
*  this isn't going to last.
*  Isn't it really who I am?
*  Yeah.
*  I've, I've talked to a few child stars that sort of got like Miley Cyrus is one
*  that I talked to recently and you know, you see it in the conversation when she's
*  describing what it was like to grow up famous and it's, it's a very difficult
*  path and I don't, you know, I think Jodie Foster, Ron Howard is a few that have
*  gotten through it.
*  Someone should actually sit down with those folks and try to figure out what's
*  the common denominator.
*  Like how did they do it?
*  Science.
*  That'd be some great times of how they did it.
*  You know, I, a story about, I had a teaching tool that had to do with something
*  I, I pulled off in Hollywood from, for my kids and I'm big on delayed
*  gratification.
*  Um, and you know, after I won the Oscar for best actor, my kids are like, well,
*  what'd you get the trophy for?
*  And I said, well, you remember a year and a half ago, we were in New Orleans,
*  Popeye would go away.
*  You wake up in the morning.
*  I was already at work and I'd come home and have dinner with y'all and tuck you
*  in and you wake up the next morning.
*  I was gone again.
*  And remember you said I look like a giraffe cause I was so skinny and like,
*  yeah.
*  And I go, well, what I was doing for those 30 days when I was gone all day,
*  a year and a half later, somebody said, deemed that excellent work.
*  And they gave me a trophy for that work.
*  What I did a year and a half ago.
*  And I remember I saw him click.
*  They were like, Oh, Oh, our future is a compounding interest.
*  You know what I mean?
*  We had an aspect, Oh, there you can build.
*  You can do something today and get rewarded tomorrow.
*  Um, and it was, it was an example that worked for them.
*  Um, of understanding, you know, that you can, that you can get, you can invest
*  and make choices to engineer more ROI.
*  You know, I know that was a milestone for you and obviously you won the Oscar for
*  it, but there's something about these physical transformation roles when, when
*  an actor does something where you realize like they're, they're literally
*  torturing themselves.
*  I mean, when you, how would it, how would you get down to how much did you weigh?
*  I weighed 135 and look, you know this, I was not torturing myself.
*  I was militant.
*  The hardest part was making the damn choice.
*  It was my responsibility.
*  If I looked like I do now playing Ron Woodruff in Dallas Buyers Club, you are
*  out of the movie, the first frame.
*  Oh, bullshit.
*  He doesn't, he's not stage four HIV.
*  Come out.
*  What's my job?
*  I had to lose the weight.
*  Once I made my mind up, I did the smart thing.
*  I gave myself five months.
*  I got on a diet where I'd have metapioca pudding or whatever, three eggs in the
*  egg whites in the morning, five ounce of fish, cup of vegetables for lunch, five
*  ounce fish, cup of vegetables for dinner, as much wine as I wanted to drink.
*  And I lost 2.5 pounds a week like clockwork, no exercise.
*  As much wine as you wanted to drink?
*  Much as I wanted.
*  How does it, what kind of diet is this?
*  It worked.
*  2.5 pounds.
*  And it didn't matter if I was going to the treadmill and burning 2000
*  calories a day or not.
*  2.5 pounds a week, clockwork.
*  And what happened during that time, and this is another reason that I really
*  didn't torture myself and people say, oh my gosh, it's been so hard.
*  I was like, no, what did I learn from it?
*  That the body is more resilient than we give it credit for.
*  I, the power I lost from the neck down equally or more so sublimated to the
*  neck up, I was so, my mental game was so acute and so on point, I was clinically
*  smart, it didn't matter if I drank my wine till one of the morning at 4.30
*  AM, no alarm clock, bang, I was up.
*  Every morning had incredible amount of mental energy.
*  I had no leverage from a neck down.
*  I mean, my knees, I had no insulation anywhere.
*  You know, my body would hurt when I try to run 10 feet, but from here up, there's
*  some things I actually miss about it.
*  What do you think, what was the process?
*  Like, why did your brain work better when you were starving yourself?
*  I think because it wasn't relying on it.
*  I think on a cellular level, I felt my body going, hey, to use a baseball term,
*  you got people over there on the bench and the dugout, then you got people out
*  in the field that are, you know, sitting in the bullpen, not working out.
*  On a cellular level, cellularly, my cells that were in the dugout and over there
*  in the bullpen had to get up and go, whoa, we're not getting fed what we used to get
*  fed, we got to exercise here, we got to come to, hut hut, because my body's not
*  getting, we're not getting what we used to get.
*  We're not placated by what we used to get.
*  Our insulation's gone.
*  Our, our, our, what we rely on is gone.
*  What we used to rely on is gone.
*  So I think my whole body woke up and my brain got really super, super sharp on that as well.
*  So I think it was the going without the, there was a bit of a, it was what I went
*  without that sharpened up and made my brain on a cellular level, much more hungry.
*  What do you weigh normally?
*  188.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So you lost 50 pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  There's roles where guys do this, where it defines their career in some way.
*  Robert De Niro, when he gained weight for Raging Bull.
*  Christian Bale, when he did the Machinist.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's these, these roles where a guy or a woman just transformed, Charlize Theron,
*  when she played monster, they, they transformed their body and it's, it's like,
*  it's a different level of commitment.
*  And when you entered into that film, was this the first time that you'd ever had
*  to do that?
*  Yeah.
*  First time I ever had to do it.
*  I mean, you, you got jacked for that.
*  Uh, well, I don't know how jacked you were before for that dragon movie.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I forget the name Rain of Fire, Rain of Fire.
*  I fucking love that movie.
*  That was my favorite.
*  Van Zandt.
*  God, I miss Van Zandt.
*  It was a great movie.
*  Talk about a guy who was about no bullshit.
*  Boy, that was a sobering character.
*  I miss that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  It was a fun character, but you were jacked in that movie.
*  Were you jacked normally or did you have to get jacked for that movie?
*  I got more jacked for that.
*  Look at our family.
*  My dad, we, we come from a, um, our anatomy and the McConaughey's have big tricep.
*  My dad, you see, you'll love this.
*  I'd be sitting there as a kid.
*  Um, and my dad was a big guy, six, four, two 65, you know, played Kentucky
*  and a Bear Bryant got drafted by the Green Bay Packers.
*  He was a big bear of a man.
*  And he comes into the living room one night and I'm in front of the TV watching
*  my favorite show, Incredible Hulk.
*  And there's Luke Rick.
*  And I'm like standing there, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
*  I'm like standing in front of the TV doing all this.
*  He goes, boy, what you doing?
*  I was like, dad, look at it, man.
*  I mean, he's got these baseball sized biceps.
*  Look at him.
*  Wow.
*  And he goes, uh, he takes off his shirt.
*  He goes, let me tell you something, son.
*  He goes that right there and pulled the bus up.
*  He goes, that's nice.
*  Makes the girls scream.
*  You know, it's for show.
*  He goes, that right there.
*  He goes, that's the work muscle.
*  That's the one that puts the roof over our head.
*  That's for dough.
*  Show and dough, the triceps for, for dough.
*  So I had big triceps.
*  So when I went and worked out and if I take a little bit of creatine,
*  my triceps go bananas.
*  So that was a minor transformation.
*  It wasn't that difficult to do.
*  No, it was, it was minor.
*  There was a lot of, a lot of boxing and, uh, um, and, and, and, and just some nice,
*  you know, throwing some weight around.
*  You just got fit.
*  But for Dallas buyers club.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I tried to stay within 10 pounds of striking weight of whatever
*  I need to do for the role.
*  Was it hard to make the decision to do that for Dallas buyers club though?
*  Because that was a giant transformation.
*  I mean,
*  it wasn't hard.
*  I was looking for something to be all consumed with something to be
*  obsessed with a singular obsession.
*  You know, this is my job.
*  So my life revolved around that.
*  My wife made me meals.
*  Trust me.
*  I didn't go to pizza hut and say, no, thank you.
*  The pizza, I'll have a salad.
*  I did not even put myself in front of temptations.
*  I, I was a hermit.
*  I stayed in my, my wife made me the meals and I studied and wrote and
*  created the character all day long.
*  And I'd never got tired of that.
*  So my world, I was in a bubble.
*  I just put myself in a bubble for five and a half months and that commitment to
*  put myself on that Island, to know that this is, it's good to have the singular
*  obsession.
*  You, you cannot go far enough.
*  McConaughey that was, there's a freedom in that.
*  There's a freedom.
*  I've always found it being having to having a character that I can commit that much
*  to.
*  You cannot go far enough though.
*  That was your thought process.
*  Yeah.
*  I knew when I got down to 135, I was like, Oh, okay.
*  That's good.
*  And mind you, we'll tell you this.
*  When I started to eat more at 135 to say, let's slow this train down and quit
*  losing weight, my body had already got the message and had its blinders on that
*  we're going South and it kept going South.
*  So that was a bit scary because I kept losing the weight because my body had
*  gotten, it already gotten in the, in the rhythm of losing weight.
*  And like I said, it turned a blind eye on getting any more food.
*  So there was a tough transition there for about two weeks to get my weight to
*  balance out again and say, let's just hold at 135.
*  So you dropped below 135 at one point in time.
*  Just went below 135, got down about 132 and then brought it back up.
*  Now, how long did it take for you to physically recover from something like
*  that?
*  Were you back to normal?
*  Man, I'm still recovering.
*  Really?
*  Cause I thought that I thought that when I saw you in that film, I told my wife,
*  I remember saying this like, this is going to take a long time for him to bounce
*  back.
*  Cause I know how hard it is for guys to cut weight for fights.
*  And I know, I know a lot of guys that have really depleted their body doing that.
*  And when I saw you that gaunt and skinny, I was like, he's eating his body.
*  Your body ate itself.
*  It was eating itself.
*  It's the only way.
*  Yeah.
*  I look, I came back and I did true detective after that.
*  And I got on true detective.
*  I got to about 167 and held and I loved that weight as well.
*  Cause I had a little more leverage, had a little more athletic ability, had a
*  little more insulation around my joints, but I was still pretty stripped and
*  ripped.
*  Um, slowly coming back from that, I did learn this.
*  I had to come back very slowly because I'd heard stories about people that go,
*  well, now I'm back.
*  Now I'm going to gain weight.
*  I can eat as much as I want and that you can, you can grow back and look deformed.
*  You can, your features can come back.
*  If you rush it, they can come back in odd ways.
*  So I very slowly put the weight back on.
*  I then did a role a few years ago.
*  I guess it was about four, three, three years after Dallas, where I put on 47
*  pounds.
*  So I was two 20.
*  What was that?
*  Which is a hell of a lot more gold.
*  It's called gold.
*  It's a hell of a lot more fun to put that weight on than to take it off where I
*  was just cheeseburger King.
*  And my family loved me in that role.
*  Cause I was captain fun.
*  I was yes to everything milkshakes for breakfast.
*  You got it.
*  Let's go.
*  Now that was, I've never talked about at that time, I was still mentally sharp,
*  not as sharp as I was when I was down at one 35, but at two 20 libido was through
*  the roof.
*  I couldn't get, I couldn't catch a cold.
*  If I swam in the damn canals of Amsterdam, man, I was like the abominable
*  snowman, I was insulated and had great energy during that time.
*  Now, coming back from that, I still got a couple of things on my back here around
*  the waist.
*  I'm like, where'd that come?
*  That came up with that rolling gold and what's that still doing hanging around?
*  You know, so I did have to come back slowly.
*  Um, but I will say this, you know, one 88 since then that's my fighting weight
*  before I look a little different than the one 88 before then, before Dallas
*  spires club, it's a different one 88.
*  So it did take a physical toll.
*  Sure.
*  I would say, you know, even, you know, neck and things like that, you know,
*  neck and, and, and, you know, bone structure is the same, but where, and now,
*  but then how much of this is just getting older too, and having less fat
*  cells, I'm not sure.
*  Um, but yeah, it, it, it didn't hurt.
*  Like I said, I think I stretched my body.
*  I noticed when, you know, when I got down to that weight at one 35, if I
*  you know, tried to sprint 10, 10 yards and I just, my knees would buckle.
*  I had no insulation.
*  I mean, he's hurt.
*  Yeah.
*  I watched it again recently just to kind of get it into my head.
*  And that's when I was thinking like, this is going to take a
*  while to bounce back from.
*  Like I almost forgot how gaunt you got.
*  And it was, it was striking, you know, and that's a fucking crazy commitment, man.
*  You drinking moonshine?
*  What are you doing there?
*  What is that?
*  Some kombucha.
*  Oh,
*  it was neither that or whiskey.
*  If you are.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  You're kombucha guy.
*  I love that stuff.
*  Daily.
*  And it too.
*  Yeah.
*  That'll that's great for the immune system.
*  Um, when you look at a role, like a role like Dallas buyers club or something
*  like that, like what makes you choose a role, does it just have to resonate with
*  you?
*  Is it who's involved, who the directors are, the producers, the other actors that
*  are committed to it?
*  Like what, what makes you decide this is interstellar?
*  Let's do it.
*  All right.
*  Well, first, what's the pedigree of the people around me, the director, the
*  script, uh, the producers are, are, are they excellent?
*  Are they the right for this story?
*  Um, I do look at that, but the main thing I look at is like this character.
*  Um, the last 12 years I've been able to choose characters that's, that made me
*  shaking my boots the right way.
*  You know, that good kind of scared where you're like, Ooh, I don't know what the
*  hell I'm going to do with this, but I can't wait to find out.
*  Um, I like characters where the decisions are really going to cost them, where
*  there's consequences with every single scene that they're in and the, the, the
*  favorite consequences to have or something like a Ron Woodruff, it's life
*  or death consequences, something like a van's end.
*  How can I remain from getting, becoming extinct?
*  You know, those are great.
*  Okay.
*  We brought it down to the bare necessities, um, how to survive or how to stay alive.
*  Um, from that place, then I can, then I can give my all that choosing roles where.
*  I'm not going to have any compression from the ceiling to the basement of the
*  emotions I want to give.
*  And no one's going to tell me, Oh, you can't be that angry.
*  Oh, no one's going to tell me you can't be that sad.
*  You can't cry that hard.
*  No one's going to tell me you can't laugh that hard.
*  No one's going to tell me you can't hurt that bad.
*  I don't like to be, I've been enjoying choosing roles that have a really high
*  ceiling and a limitless ceiling and a limitless basement to where I'm at, you
*  can, can go as deep or as high as I want to with them.
*  There's a lot of roles that I've done in my career, for instance, like with
*  romantic comedies where those emotions are compressed for a reason, the ceiling.
*  You can't laugh that loud.
*  You can't love that hard.
*  You can't get that pissed off.
*  You'll sink the ship of those movies.
*  They die built for buoyancy.
*  I've been enjoying the dramatic roles.
*  And that's what I love about drama is that.
*  No, it's to the individual actor, your ceiling of how much you want to love or
*  your basement, how much you want to hate.
*  Go for it.
*  Um, there is no, there is no limit on either one of those.
*  That's the kind of role that really has been turning me on.
*  And that makes me feel like I'm having an experience in the making of the movie
*  in the architecture of the character, um, rather than just going and doing a
*  job and getting a paycheck.
*  During the quarantine, the lockdown, my family and I had movie night, basically
*  every night, especially when the kids were doing zoom classes, because, you know,
*  it just, it was, we had to do something different.
*  So we, we mix it up and we watch contact again.
*  And I haven't seen contact in forever.
*  And, uh, first of all, God damn, what a good movie that was.
*  That's a good movie.
*  That's a good movie.
*  And a great movie about aliens.
*  Like, like, uh, um, a movie that it gives you a different perspective on the
*  possibilities of contact and, and just the fact that it was a Carl Sagan book
*  and there's just so much good to it.
*  That character that you played was, uh, as a fascinating guy.
*  And I kind of feel like there's some of you in that guy.
*  Sure.
*  I mean, you are, you, you are, am I wrong here?
*  You are religious in some way.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And I want to, I want to bring this up in this day and age when people go, no, I'm
*  not religious, I'm only spiritual.
*  You know what the Latin root of religion is?
*  Relegare and legare means to bind together.
*  Re means again.
*  Well, in a world that's saying I'm only spiritual because I want unity.
*  That's exactly what religion means.
*  We bastardized the meaning of it over time and we've excluded people and we've
*  corporatized it and such, but yes, I am religious.
*  Um, that character, you know, I had written stories, I'd written a college
*  paper called John Wayne goes West.
*  And it was about how do you, how do you, how can you be a believer in a world of
*  science?
*  And I remember writing things like during the make of that movie, like science is
*  the practical pursuit of God.
*  Um, the two are not exclusive.
*  Uh, they, they, they, they dance together there.
*  They, they, they go together, um, belief in science.
*  And I never saw those as contradictions.
*  And that's part of what the reason I attacked that role and became part of that,
*  that movie.
*  I wanted to play a person that had that point of view of a believer in a world of
*  science, not at the exclusion of science and not at the exclusion of belief.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a confusing role for a lot of people.
*  If someone is a believer and also a proponent of science, um, because they
*  want to know what are your literal beliefs?
*  Like, are you taking the Bible at its literal word or do you use it as some
*  sort of a guidebook of the experiences of these people that live thousands of
*  years ago that have been translated from multiple different languages back to
*  English?
*  And is there wisdom in those translations?
*  Is there wisdom in those original thoughts, these thousands of years of
*  people contemplating and, and mulling on these things and that so many have used
*  these as a scaffolding for morals and ethics and for societies.
*  Yep.
*  It's, it's, it's, it's, I mean, you know, for people that go, Oh, it's, it's, it's,
*  it's, it's a, it's a circus book or people that, the non-believers.
*  I'm like, well, it's still the best one going.
*  Um, there's a lot of great truths that, that, that, that come out of the Bible.
*  And it is open for a lot of people that has been interpreted and reinterpreted.
*  It has been translated.
*  It's been handed down.
*  Um, I, for myself, I don't know what to do in my daily life with the burning
*  push.
*  I don't know what to do with that.
*  Um, I do know what to do with love your neighbor like yourself.
*  I do know what to do with Matthew six 22.
*  If they, I be single, that whole body will be full of light.
*  I do know what to do with some proverbs that I can take into daily practice and
*  go, Oh, I felt my life.
*  I felt improvement.
*  I felt success in my relationships and my relationship with the day with my
*  career by following that, um, by treating others, how I wanted to be treated, the
*  golden rule.
*  So I take the practical stuff myself, um, and try to, try to utilize it and, and
*  pick out what can work for me.
*  When you say, when you say you don't know what to do with the burning bush, like
*  what do you, what do you mean by that?
*  I don't know what to do on a daily basis with the teaching of, um, and, and then
*  he, you know, and then he, he, he showed up as a, as a, as a burning bush or the
*  magic tricks.
*  And I don't know what to do with.
*  And Jesus healed everyone that he, and then he couldn't walk and now he touched
*  me and he can walk.
*  I don't know what to do with that.
*  Um, I don't, I don't know how to take that into my life and go, Oh, there's
*  something useful and practical and healthy for you, Matthew, that you can practice
*  there.
*  So the magic, um, that leans in towards, you know, what we would call now more
*  fantasy, I don't know what to do with that.
*  I, there's philosophies and there's proverbs and there's teachings that I
*  think are very valid and very helpful, um, that we could all be reminded of that
*  are in the Bible that I do find quite useful.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's almost impossible to figure out what they were trying to say with a
*  lot of the things.
*  It's why it's so it's open to interpretation, but also open to
*  manipulation.
*  And that's where people have a real problem with it when it's used for, to,
*  to separate people, to, uh, exclude people, to marginalize people, to judge
*  people, but it's, it's hard for people that understand that those aspects and
*  that those things happen to actually parse out that there's good about it too.
*  And that there's a lot of really valuable lessons in these books.
*  A hundred percent.
*  Um, you're like, I, I get it.
*  I mean, you, you know, it's like a, what are our, what are our fathers teach us?
*  How is your father still alive?
*  Well, I don't really know him.
*  I have a complicated, uh, family history.
*  Okay.
*  Well, fathers are father figures.
*  I have a stepfather.
*  He's still alive and I'm close to him.
*  Well, stepfather, when he goes, you'll find that's
*  some things where the messenger and the message weren't exactly in simpatico.
*  Sure.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Does that mean that you throw the messenger out and you're like, oh,
*  bullshit, you weren't following all that stuff.
*  No, you take the message.
*  The, this is the stuff that you can, that could work for you, that maybe they wanted
*  it for you, they couldn't follow through on it themselves.
*  There's certain parts of the Bible that have that too.
*  You don't throw out the whole, you can't, I don't think it's, it makes
*  any sense to throw out the whole book.
*  It's what we're doing in society now.
*  I mean, we're, we're, we're, we're making people persona non grata, uh, because
*  of something they, they, they do, or, you know, in, in, in, and that is, that
*  is right now deemed wrong, or it's the hot point on a hot topic right now.
*  You can erase someone's entire existence.
*  Where the heck does some forgiveness go?
*  And again, that like optimism, it's not erasing the crisis.
*  It's not saying there wasn't a problem first.
*  It's not saying that there's version parts of the Bible that have been, people
*  have bastardized and used in the wrong way.
*  Um, but you don't throw the whole book out and say, well, it's all, it's all bad
*  then it's all these because that's, it's false.
*  Have you encountered difficulty expressing this, uh, in Hollywood?
*  You know, Hollywood is predominantly left wing and very secular or
*  Jewish in some circles, but it's not like a place where Christian fundamental
*  values are espoused openly, you know, a lot of, a lot of Jewish folks are in
*  Hollywood and that seems to be okay with a lot of people, but some other religions,
*  particularly if you're a fundamentalist Christian, or if you have Christian values,
*  a lot of people frown upon that.
*  Why, why, why do you think that is?
*  And have you, have you had difficulties with that?
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't had difficulties.
*  I have had, and I won't throw any people into the bus, but I have had, um,
*  moments where I was on stage receiving an award in front of my peers in Hollywood.
*  And there were people in the crowd that I have prayed with before dinners many times.
*  And when I thank God, I saw some of those people go to clap, but then notice that,
*  well, well, it's a bad thing on my resume and then sit back on their hands.
*  And I've seen people read the room and go, Whoa, that wouldn't bode well for me in
*  the future if forgetting a job or you're getting votes or what have you.
*  Um, I have seen that I've witnessed that.
*  Um, I don't, I don't judge them for it.
*  I just wish, you know, that, that, that, that it seems like a silly argument.
*  There's, it's a, you know, one of the things that are, are, are people, some
*  people in our industry, not all of them, but this, there's some that go to the
*  left so far as, uh, our friend Jordan Peterson, who's back, um, saw his video
*  of him back that go to the illiberal left side so far that is so condescending
*  and patronizing to 50% of the world that need the empathy that the liberal side
*  gives and should give, um, to, to, to, to throw some what he's illegitimize them
*  because they say they are a believer.
*  It's just so arrogant.
*  Uh, and in some ways hypocritical to me.
*  Um, yeah, so I haven't run into, you know, I haven't headbutted trouble on that,
*  but I've always, you look my, my career, I've pretty much gone my own, my own
*  path and by hook or by crook, just trying to figure a way out into, into what I was
*  doing and I haven't, I haven't measured or noticed where it has harmed or gotten
*  my way of what I wanted to achieve in Hollywood.
*  I think you slipped through the net.
*  You got far enough down the river where it's not going to be a problem.
*  Well, kind of like when I, you know, like my mom, when I first got famous, you
*  know, it's just a great story in the book.
*  Um, right when I got famous, I'm trying to figure my own shit out.
*  Right.
*  And then, uh, next night I got a call.
*  My buddy says, Hey, you watching this?
*  I'm like, what?
*  He goes, turn on hard copy.
*  And there's my mom with the cameraman taking a guy through our house.
*  And this is where I caught him in bed with Melissa.
*  No, they caught him doing in there.
*  Oh, don't worry about it.
*  It's no big deal.
*  I've seen it a thousand times and I'm going, I call her up.
*  I'm like, mom, what did you do?
*  And she's like, what?
*  I go, don't say what I can hear it in your, on the other end of the line.
*  You're watching it too.
*  It's hard copy.
*  She's like, Oh, I didn't think you'd find out.
*  So I had eight years where my mom and I's relationship was strained.
*  I couldn't, I didn't have a mother to talk to, to share things with.
*  Cause hell it show up on a hard copy the next night.
*  My career got solidified enough.
*  You know, I slipped through the net.
*  I was, I was stable enough.
*  I went in and let go of the reins and said, mom, you can go for it.
*  You, you can take the mic anytime.
*  You can hit that red carpet, wear your short leather dress and talk, whatever,
*  sell whatever stores you want to.
*  But again, it took a while for me to feel stable enough to slip through the
*  net and let her go be herself as well.
*  This thing you're talking about with, uh, people disparaging people for their
*  opinions and their beliefs and their, the way they live in their life.
*  I think a lot of this is coming from this condensed way of impersonal communication
*  that we're getting from social media.
*  I think it's, is this is so much of the way people are judging people and the
*  way people are communicating with people.
*  One-on-one is how human beings are supposed to talk.
*  That's how we're supposed to work things out.
*  And when you look at a person's eyes and you experience their, their feelings
*  and you read their social cues, that's how we communicate.
*  And that's how we work things out and hash things out and, and figure each other
*  out and maybe someone has a different set of beliefs in you, but they happen
*  to be your neighbor and you like them.
*  And you're like, Hey man, tell me what's it like to be a Sikh?
*  What, what, what is it like to be a Muslim?
*  What is it?
*  What are your beliefs as a Quaker?
*  Like, what do you, what, what's going on in your life?
*  Tell me.
*  I've, I had a neighbor who was one of my favorite neighbors I've ever had.
*  He was a Scientologist and he was a weird dude, man, but he was always friendly as
*  hell and I would go outside and we'd have weird conversations about these things
*  that he was doing and I just try to figure him out and he'd try to figure me out.
*  And we, you know, we always wave to each other.
*  We're always friendly.
*  I miss that guy, but he, uh, he and I, if we were talking online,
*  I'd be like, you know, if, if I was a younger man and I was dumber and he said
*  something about his belief and I thought that was stupid, I'd probably say,
*  what kind of dumb shit is that?
*  You believe that nonsense written by a science fiction author, but talking to
*  the guy that that was never the way I talked to him when he and I were looking
*  at each other, we were just two neighbors trying to figure each other out and just
*  trying to be friendly and have a harmonious neighborhood.
*  Well, it's one of the, one of the things I think you're going to like, uh, about
*  your new home, the city.
*  I think I mentioned this to you when I, when I, when I called you to say welcome,
*  you know, one of the great things about Austin, Texas is even though it's the
*  blueberry and tomato soup, the, the, the more liberal city in the conservative
*  state, you can see neighbors next door to each other, talking to each other.
*  And one has a Trump sign in the yard.
*  The other one has a Biden sign in the yard.
*  They're still having a conversation.
*  They're still having a conversation.
*  No one's going sneaking out in the middle of the night to go rip
*  that other person's sign out.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, it's when Austin is at its best.
*  It has, it has that, you know, I think that the, the, you know, and I've got
*  young children and they're starting to get, we don't, wow, I'm on social media
*  yet, but you see these people who are living in a time where you put out
*  something of yourself and your own value of yourself is reliant on what the world
*  out there, strangers, you don't know comment about that.
*  And if I put out a picture that I'm really having excited about on Instagram
*  tonight, and if I'm going to look what the reaction is and the majority says,
*  Oh F you McConnally this all of a sudden I have a bad night.
*  I'm having a bad time.
*  But if you go same picture and you go awesome and the consensus awesome, all
*  of a sudden you've controlled how I feel and I'm having a great night.
*  I'm in a great mood.
*  So we're at the, we're sort of at the behest people of we're reacting.
*  That's, that's kind of what we're doing more in the social.
*  We were reacting and you look at, you know, things that, things that go on
*  on issues right now, it, it, it, everyone's reacting to, to, to things
*  instead of, it's instead of creating the story or having an opinion coming out
*  of the gate and Hey, I understand it to some extent because people are getting,
*  you get hired and fired on those things these days, you know, hired and fired
*  about you hired and fired or not hired because you don't have as many people
*  following your whatever it is.
*  Um, that's a measure now of, of, of what we call success in this life, you know,
*  or what's at the top in America, money and fame, baby, you got that.
*  You've made it in America.
*  You are successful.
*  We pat you on the back.
*  We give you respect.
*  I got nothing against money and fame.
*  I got money and I'm famous, but that's not where my value system lies or what
*  I'm, what is most important to me and what I'm trying to teach my kids is a
*  way to get that.
*  And if you can do it in a way to have your value system, let's, let's
*  pray, let's praise that.
*  Um, but it's tough because that's not what the world right now, especially
*  America rewards people for.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there's a real issue with social media, uh, in particular with children
*  in that we're just not designed for that.
*  We're not designed for that kind of communication.
*  And it's so easy to dismiss someone who's just text on a screen.
*  It's so easy to, to, to, to shut people down.
*  And it's, you see people getting praised because they're famous and because
*  they're wealthy.
*  I mean, how much of what social media is for a lot of young kids is seeing
*  famous people in front of Lamborghini's with a million dollar watch on it's a
*  bizarre posing ritual that people are doing.
*  It's very strange.
*  Funny story about that.
*  I'm in Miami, Southeast.
*  Now mind you, I really like Miami because it's so obvious.
*  I mean, in LA people get like a boob job or lip job or a calf job.
*  And they try to say, no, it's all natural in Miami.
*  They go, I just got my calf job.
*  I just got a boob job.
*  Hold up, hold up, hold up calf jobs.
*  How many people are getting calf jobs?
*  Oh, guys will go get a calf implant.
*  Is that real?
*  That's still happening.
*  And in Miami, they're proud.
*  They're showing you like they're out there.
*  There's no shame in that.
*  There's no embarrassment.
*  Not getting that.
*  All right.
*  I'm in Miami making a film and it was the beach bum and I'm walking along the
*  beach and there's this guy unbuttoned silk shirt, got his gold chains on.
*  He's all greased up and he's leaning against his purple Lamborghini and he's
*  got somebody taking pictures of him.
*  And I'm just saying like, what's going on?
*  He's got the palm trees in the back of the ocean.
*  So I asked him, I said, what are you doing?
*  And he goes, oh man, I'm getting this picture taken for my Tinder page, man.
*  In the next 20 minutes, two other guys came by and I asked him, I go, is that
*  your Lamborghini?
*  He goes, no, no, no.
*  I just rented it for the day for my Tinder page pic.
*  Two guys walked by in the next 20 minutes and paid him 50 bucks to lean
*  against his purple rented Lamborghini to get their Tinder page pic.
*  Oh my God.
*  I wonder if it works.
*  It's got to work.
*  It's got to work on someone.
*  And he got his rent paid for, for his purple Lamborghini.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, Miami, you should have a passport to go there.
*  It's barely America.
*  It's a lot of fun.
*  It's a great place.
*  It's a lovely city.
*  I love visiting there, but I don't think I could ever live there.
*  I go to Miami and I just go, you guys are fucking out of control.
*  It's the only place before I was doing my last Netflix special, I was using these
*  yonder bags and what a yonder bag is, is you have to put your cell phone in the
*  bag when you go in there so you can't film the show or you can't talk on it.
*  And the idea is that the people won't be distracted because their cell phone will
*  be in this magnetic pouch.
*  You have it, you have possession of your phone.
*  Nobody's taking your phone.
*  But when you want to leave or use the phone, like someone's going to call you,
*  maybe you got a babysitter, you can go outside.
*  They'll open the pouch up and then you can use your phone.
*  Most shows I did this, I did shows all over the country.
*  The shows, people were more attentive.
*  They sat down.
*  They didn't get distracted by their phone and they just listened.
*  In Miami, all they did was get up and go outside.
*  So the whole show, the fucking shows like an hour and 45 minutes, it's just people
*  getting up and going out and coming back and getting up and coming back and
*  getting up and coming back.
*  It was like people were constantly going back and forth.
*  I don't know if they're doing Coke or if they're just part, but they were the idea
*  of not having their phone with them.
*  They're like, what?
*  What the fuck?
*  I need my phone.
*  They're so distracted.
*  So chaotic.
*  It was a lot of fun though.
*  I'm not complaining.
*  Where the mannequins, even the mannequins have fake boobs.
*  It's true.
*  It's true.
*  It is true.
*  If you go to a department store, the mannequins have giant fake boobs.
*  Yeah.
*  Because look, the girls that want to buy those clothes also have fake boobs.
*  They don't want some weird natural body.
*  Like, how am I going to know what it's going to look like on me?
*  And again, I'm not shitting on Miami.
*  I love it here.
*  I love it there rather.
*  But I always said, if you want to starve to death, open up a bookstore in Miami.
*  Ain't nobody buying books there.
*  Nobody's buying green lights.
*  They might get the audio book and listen to it when they're on the treadmill.
*  But it's a wild place.
*  And that show that I did, the shows that I did down there, they were fun.
*  I had a great time.
*  The audiences were great.
*  They laugh hard, but they were just all over the place.
*  They're just up and down and back and up and back and coming back and sitting down.
*  Excuse me.
*  Pardon me.
*  Up more people.
*  I'm like, you guys are out of fucking control.
*  Yeah, it's an obvious place.
*  Have you ever seen the documentaries, Cocaine Cowboys?
*  Yes.
*  Well, that's all the whole cult, like how it all got started down there.
*  The craziness.
*  Cocaine Cowboys, one and two of my all time favorite documentaries.
*  Miami's got a wild fucking history.
*  Yep, it does.
*  And stories like that make great films, though, because there's some...
*  There's real live stories about this country in particular, but this world in general,
*  that, you know, like Scarface or something like that, where it's just like,
*  this is kind of based on reality.
*  It's one of the beautiful things about a film is that a film like Scarface will make you
*  look into that, like, well, how much of this is real?
*  Did they really do that?
*  Oh, yeah, they really did send over prisoners and release prisoners and send them to America.
*  And they really did have hundreds and thousands of murders and gun violence
*  all over the streets and cocaine everywhere.
*  And that's real.
*  That was real.
*  Yep.
*  And it was happening.
*  That's the best it's always said, you know, truth changer is stranger than fiction.
*  But yeah, I mean, one of the words I have a page in the book about my least favorite word
*  in English language being unbelievable.
*  No, it's all pretty dog on believable.
*  And you see it happen.
*  You're like, yep, wow, I didn't think that was possible.
*  Well, it damn sure was.
*  And it's usually stranger than any Hollywood script could make it or more exciting.
*  Yeah, I say unbelievable too often.
*  And it's sort of a placeholder word for holy shit.
*  Right.
*  You know, unbelievable.
*  But it is believable.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I mean, you have to be pretty odd in this day and age to be unbelievable.
*  I don't remember the last thing I saw that was unbelievable, whether it was
*  something or whether it's like, are you fucking kidding me?
*  I'm like, you know, boy, it's one thing you can depend on people being its people.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, so in your life right now, when you know, you've had this incredibly successful career,
*  and I assume you're still writing down these lists of things to do.
*  When you when you look at like, what you would like to accomplish, I mean,
*  you've accomplished so much in the world of acting and filmmaking.
*  Is there something out there that really is a goal or a thought that's sticking in your mind
*  or something you haven't done yet?
*  Yeah.
*  One of the things I got to do that's at the top of the list is do my best to
*  shepherd three young children through this life so they can go off and be independent
*  and autonomous and hopefully competent young individuals.
*  That's priority number one.
*  But personally, there's a role that I've created and assumed for myself called
*  Minister of Culture. And it's about finding a shared and competent value system.
*  And it's something that I'm going to initialize it, hopefully right there in Austin.
*  Values, as far as I can tell, are the common denominator that they've always been cool.
*  There's ones that we can agree on. They work then, they work now, they will not go out of style.
*  We're in such a time right now where our social contracts are so broken,
*  and they're broken with ourselves as well. We don't have expectations of each other or of
*  ourselves. It's kind of anarchy, a nation divided. And in Austin in particular, as a very popular
*  and fast growing city, it's changing a lot. And, you know, if Austin is a city,
*  it starts to consume more than it creates, starts to not be conscious with its money,
*  starts not to invest in itself. If too many people come to Austin from California,
*  wherever they come from, and try to turn Austin into why they left, where they were coming from,
*  we're going to look up in 10 years and go, what the hell happened, man? And Austin's got a lot of
*  soul, got a lot of soul. And I think it lies in its values. So this sort of campaign movement that
*  I want to push is reminding those of us from Austin why we love it there. Austin's a place
*  where nobody's too good, everybody's good enough. And initiating and educating newcomers and saying,
*  hey, here's who we are, who is who we're not. If you don't really want to abide by who we are and
*  what we believe in, make it a stop, not a stay, keep on moving. But I think Austinites have earned
*  that. And I think newcomers will appreciate that. I want to look up in 10 years and be in Austin,
*  be a city that's an example of a place that became a metropolis that held on to its soul.
*  The things you look at around town, crime rate, employment, et cetera, are still at numbers that
*  are incredibly respectable. But we don't get loose. It's a very creative town. And like I said,
*  it's the blueberry in the red state. But it's not an anarchic town. It's not a dirty town. It's not
*  a sloppy town. It's an innovative town. It's a creative town. And it's a young town. And I think
*  we all know progress is not saying yes to every new thing. Progress is more about innovation,
*  but it's also relying on tried and true things that work, have worked, and will continue to work.
*  And I just want to remind us all the certain values that we have as Austinites and as individuals.
*  Where that goes from there, if that goes outside of Austin and through the United States,
*  it's a scalable idea that I dream of that could go outside of the United States. It could go
*  worldwide in success. I like looking at cities and people, looking at cities as individuals that have
*  personalities and reminding the people, let's sell a city to the people that live in it. Sell
*  Austin to Austinites and to people who are coming to it. That's my goal. That's what I'm into right
*  now. That's the character that I'm inhabiting right now in my life that's not on the screen.
*  I'm wanting to say, hey, the big show's live. Life. The recorder's always on. And what's the
*  story we're telling in life? That's the character I want to play right now in my life outside of my
*  family that's not on any kind of screen or any kind of capsule that's going to be on your television
*  screen. If I pull it off, it's going to be something that I'm just living and doing and becoming.
*  There's something about this town that's very unique. I knew it for years. I've been coming
*  here doing stand-up since the 90s. But when the pandemic hit and I decided to move here,
*  well, I did have that feeling like, boy, a lot of Californians are going to move here.
*  How do we not fuck it up? And you and I had this very conversation, like, don't turn this into the
*  place you left. So what specifically do you think people need to not do? To not do? Yeah. Well,
*  you're coming to Texas because you got no taxes. You're coming to Austin because it's affluent.
*  It's happening. You're coming for the people, the food, the swing. It's happening. It's a
*  creative town. It's alive. It's young. You got to pay a tithe. Ask what you can do for Austin.
*  Personalize the place, man. I mean, give your tithe to the city. It is a place, like I said,
*  that nobody's too good and everybody's good enough. We don't run over people to get where we're going.
*  Austin will open up their proverbial roller decks. And you tell me if you've felt this
*  with yourself quicker than any city I've ever been to as a newcomer. Oh, yeah. You want to
*  go on some contacts? Yeah. I mean, in some ways I'm like, Austin, boy, you know, you maybe could
*  take more ownership of that IP, but it gives it away. It's very free and we trust it. It's a very
*  trusting town and a town of second chances for people, but don't take advantage of that freedom.
*  Understand that there's responsibility to the freedoms that we have, that we do have to earn it
*  daily. And don't just over-leverage yourself and spin because, hey, we're the most popular person
*  in school right now. Don't get caught looking in the mirror at ourselves going, oh, aren't I great?
*  Look at us. We're number one. We're popular. Uh-uh. We still got boots on and we still pull them on
*  and strap them on and get work done. Even though we're young and innovative in Tech Town, we're
*  still a classic. And, you know, it's accountability, it's responsibility, it's fairness to other people.
*  It's understanding where is Austin idyllic and what is it really? Because in some ways I think
*  of Austin, I'm finding out it's not as ideal as I think it is in my mind. Well, I've got a listening
*  tour and I talk about the diversity in Austin and it is a international destination. And I talk about
*  the equality of Austin. You know, the rule in Austin has always been all you got to do is be
*  yourself. That's kind of the rule. That's what's cool about Austin. Not what you think you ought
*  to be, but just be yourself. Doesn't matter if you're blue-haired, short, lesbian, American Indian,
*  cowboy, sheriff, whatever. Everyone's sitting at the same bar having a drink and no one's yelling
*  about their place because if you're yelling about, hey, I want to let you know how I'm different in
*  Austin. Austin's like going, what were you yelling about? We didn't really care. That's one of the
*  great things about Austin at best. It celebrates differences when Austin is at its best. Austin's
*  not trying to homogenize people to say, hey, we're all the same. No, we're not. We're all very
*  different and that's cool. But we do have some social contracts amongst us. We're a clean place.
*  We don't lie, cheat, and steal to get where we're going. We look ahead, but we appreciate tradition
*  at the same time. We take care as much as we can of our natural beauties around here. At the same
*  time, we're metropolis. We're growing up. Now, how can we grow up and wide and still grow deep?
*  That's what I want to lean into is what are the roots so we're not just, again, looking up in
*  10 years and going, who do we become? Where did all these socialites come from?
*  You know?
*  Yeah. One thing that's plaguing Los Angeles that I'm starting to see here is the homelessness
*  intent form all over the city. Los Angeles is out of control. I mean, it's bizarre that it hasn't
*  been handled. I mean, I was just having a conversation with my friend Brian about it before
*  the show and he was telling me that in Burbank, they just shut that down. They won't let it happen.
*  You can't just put up a tent somewhere. I mean, I'm an empathetic person and I think that
*  all the people that are out there that are homeless, that are down their luck for whatever reason,
*  whether it's they've been abused or they're alcoholics or drug addicts or whatever it is,
*  they're all our brothers and sisters. I'm not a social engineer. I don't know what the solution
*  is to something like that, but I know that it gets out of hand. It's gotten out of—if you go to Venice,
*  my friend Bridget sent me a video of her driving down Venice and it's a mile of tents. I mean,
*  a straight mile. She got the phone out the window and it's just tents everywhere. It's crazy.
*  How do you put a stop to that without being an asshole? How do you maintain empathy and say,
*  hey, you can't put a fucking tent up on the sidewalk? Great question and I don't know the
*  answer. You said it earlier. Look, most of these people have a mental challenge or they've gotten
*  drugs. In Austin, we're putting some up in some vacated hotels. I don't know to what extent that's
*  working. I've got friends who have businesses downtown who they've got homeless people camping
*  out in front and if someone walks in, they're getting berated by this person that's homeless,
*  that has this mental—something mentally askew in their nugget. I don't know. You can't eliminate
*  the problem, but this question of how do we rehabilitate is an ongoing question, not just
*  with homeless people. It's with people that don't have mental problems. It's
*  we have the question of rehabilitation. I mean, and for those people, I'm like, well, you have to
*  be sincerely seeking retribution and understand what you did wrong to get the chance to be
*  forgiven and rehabilitate and get a second chance. For the homeless people, I think if you're going to
*  go to the—how do we get them more mentally stable and can we to what extent get them mental help?
*  Not just keep picking them up and saying, well, let's move them to this side of the curb.
*  Well, that curb got full. Let's move them to this side of the curb. Then you end up with a shanty
*  town or something. I think there are always going to be, to some extent, there's going to be
*  homeless. There's always going to be some socioeconomic imbalance. I don't think we're ever going to—that's
*  another thing that I think we have to, as a people, especially on the left, have to realize. This so
*  perfect equality amongst all of us and perfect justice, I don't think that's a possible
*  destination for anybody. I think it's great to keep—America is a constant chase to chasing a
*  jet. We never will get there. And that's the point. Just keep chasing it. Try to have a little
*  ascension in our journey going forward and a little bit of evolution. But we're never going
*  to arrive at this utopian state where, ta-da, we did it. It's the Garden of Eden before an apple
*  was eaten. It's not going to happen, I don't believe. I question how the best way to rehabilitate
*  situations and like the homeless one all the time. I don't know the answer. If we can get
*  them some mental help and then give somebody—if we can make jails not just a holding cell.
*  Think about it. If jails really worked, once you've done your time,
*  you ought to be even money, right? Yeah, you should be better. You're not even money. You're
*  coming out with the scarlet letter on you and you're going to have to work five times harder than the
*  next guy to get that job. If you're an offender of such, you're going to be found and located
*  and they're going to share your location through the city and you're going to find out from your
*  neighbor that you're moving in. You can understand the people going, I don't want that. Somebody's
*  living next door to me. Well, if rehabilitation worked, it would be like, well, no, it's okay
*  because they did their stint. It doesn't really work like that. It's a constant question I have
*  about how it's the best way to rehabilitate. No one seems to have an answer. Everyone throws
*  their hands up in the air and just keeps on moving. I don't know. One of the things you were
*  talking about before, Jordan Peterson talks about that equality of outcome is a terrible idea.
*  Equality of opportunity is a fantastic idea. Opportunity to succeed. But the problem with
*  equality of outcome is there's not equality of effort. It's one of the beautiful things about
*  society is that you, and this is what we were talking about before about reading your memoir
*  and reading an autobiography of a successful person is realizing that there's work to be done
*  there's things you have to do in order to be this person that people admire. And it doesn't come
*  easy. And some people aren't going to do that work. And if they're not going to do that work,
*  they're not going to achieve that outcome. And that's just life. And the equality of opportunity,
*  that's not even real because different people start off at different blocks in life. They start
*  off in different spots. They start off with different challenges and different physical
*  attributes and physical problems. Everyone has their own hand of cards that you're dealt.
*  But treating people equally and giving people the best possible chance that we can as a community
*  and as a culture. That's what we all strive for. And the problem with the homeless situation and
*  the problem with prisons, it's a similar problem is that the downtrodden, the people that have
*  hit a bad spot in the game of life. What is our responsibility to them? And if we are a community,
*  look, there's only three of us and one of us is fucked up. We go, hey, let's help Mike. He's
*  fucked up. Let's try to bring Mike into the fold and give him some life lessons and give him some
*  love and hope that we can bring him back up to a point where a couple years from now we're looking
*  back on this going, hey, look, you used to be over there and now you're here and everything's great.
*  That's what we'd ultimately love. But there's almost too many challenges and too many people
*  and everybody has their own problems. So people throw their arms up in the air and they keep
*  moving. And these things don't seem to get better. The prison population seems to increase,
*  homeless population, especially during this pandemic has increased. I don't have answers.
*  I really don't. So I'm spinning my wheels as much as the next guy.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's a question that's yet to be answered on many levels before this time and
*  after this time. You know, that equal opportunity, that would be the gig. That would be there.
*  Yeah.
*  Because then you could measure, because we are all born with different innate abilities.
*  And if we're fortunate enough to be in a position where we go, well, I'm going to do what I'm good
*  at and I'm going to work my backside off for it. And I'm going to get educated about, I'm willing
*  to put in the work. You should, America's a place that that's the American dream. You could use,
*  that's what they mean by the land of opportunity. If you should have the chance to pursue what you
*  want to do. And if you're willing to work for it and get educated on it, you have an opportunity
*  to make a life. I understand there's not complete equal opportunity across the board. I understand
*  that I personally was born with different innate abilities than you or someone else.
*  I was also born with more opportunities than a lot of people. I was born into a two parent family.
*  That's one of our biggest diseases. I think in the, in the, in the, in that we have in the States is
*  that the, the, the, the, the family unit breaks up sometimes too quickly, too easily, you know,
*  mom or dad jets, if the going gets tough too quickly. So, you know, I, you know, I was,
*  some would say symmetrically speaking, I'm a good looking guy. So that's got me in doors
*  that maybe it wouldn't have got other people into. I tried to do my best. Once I got in the door,
*  I'm not going to apologize for any opportunities I've had, but I do understand that I've had
*  opportunities that other people have not had. I've created many on my own, but I've also been
*  introduced and met people who open those doors for me that would not have been open for other
*  people. Yeah. What do we, what do we do with them? I think there's a place, and this is what I'm
*  striving to get to and understand more and more. None of us do a damn thing about anything unless
*  it's personal. Intellectually, we talk about it. It makes sense, but we really don't take action
*  until it's trespassing on our walls and it's going to affect me or you or my family. That's when we
*  go, okay, I'm going to take action. So I think whatever we do has got to be personal.
*  The choice that I'm making for my own self is choice for me. There's a place where there's a
*  choice where that also is what's best for the most amount of people. Where the personal choice
*  is also the best choice for the most amount of people. I call it the egotistical utilitarian.
*  That's where the I meets the we. That's where what we want is what we need. And what we need
*  is actually what we want. Where what's best for us is best for the most amount of people.
*  Where we're the most selfless, we're actually the most selfish. Where we're the most selfish,
*  we're actually the most selfless. That's the place where, when I talk about green lights,
*  there's a place to create green lights that are best for ourselves and others at the same time.
*  That's the honey hole. I don't know exactly what that place is all the time, but that's the place
*  I think we could all be a little more conscious of how we go about moving forward and making choices
*  based on that. Austin seems to be of a manageable size. As I was trying to describe this to one of
*  my friends in LA, he's like, what's so great about Austin? I was like, first of all, people aren't
*  devalued because there's not too many of them. There's a problem with when there's too many
*  people, then people become a nuisance. There's too many of them. Austin doesn't have that problem.
*  So when I look at the homelessness problem in Austin, you know what? This is not out of control
*  yet. This seems like you could still fix that. Someone's got to realize that this could get out
*  of hand. This is a thing that you can kind of, it's within the boundaries of resources to step in
*  and manage this. And manage it now. Yes, before it gets out. Yeah. Look up and 10 years ago,
*  shit is too late. It's out of control. Like Venice. Yeah. We wanted to just grow and turn our backs on
*  that and not look at it. Now all of a sudden it's out of hand and I don't know what to do with it.
*  And it happens quick. It happens quick. Venice two years ago was not this. There was a few tents,
*  every here and there you'd see tents. Now it's fucking bonkers. And I mean, obviously you're
*  dealing with a much larger population in California, but this place is special. I mean,
*  it really is. It's a great size and the people here are really exceptional. And it does have
*  a personality. It has a very unique, like a mixture of cowboys and hippies. It's a weird spot.
*  That melting, blending of all these different types of people here has made it very tolerant
*  and very unique. And the fact that there's the university here and there's a lot of
*  artistic people and musical people and creative people. It's a real good spot and I'm happy to
*  be here, but I don't want to fuck it up. I hear you. Well, there's a lot of, you know,
*  there is a community in Austin and Austin at its best does come together and realize that it has
*  an identity to move forward with, to protect. And you're right. It's not so big. And I believe that
*  it can grow and, but it can grow while still having a sense of itself and its own identity
*  and it can protect that identity and grow forward. Turn the page, progress. Yes, it's coming,
*  but also preserve the core DNA of who we are. We're no longer the little hippie town that's just had
*  some music in the Capitol and at university. No, we're .com tech town. We're banker town,
*  lawyer town, international destination, all those things. That's fine. But in that there's a,
*  Austin has, I want to help define by listening to a lot of Austinites as well,
*  what our constitution is in Austin that's separate from anywhere else.
*  So this is something you're actively trying to do. You said a minister of culture. Is this
*  something you have a thought in your head of how to do this? Yes. I have a shared values campaign
*  that I've put together. And I want to sort of advertise and sell Austin to Austin all around
*  Austin. And it's just sort of, sort of a value-based aspirational messages, just to remind us who we are
*  to keep the community as tight as possible, to form expectations and solidify expectations amongst
*  ourselves. So if someone acts outside of those, they're noticed and they're kind of nudged back.
*  There's another thing Austin does very well. Austin, I don't know how it is now since we've had
*  like the protests with Black Lives Matter and stuff, but Austin used to be, there was a great
*  relationship with the police force, not just with me, with seeing Matthew McConnally walk down the
*  street with John and Jane Doe. You went jaywalking across 6th Street. They caught you before and
*  nudged you over and said, Hey, don't do it before they gave you the ticket. There was a play of like,
*  they were part of the community. They felt like you give them a wave. You didn't see a cop in Austin
*  and go, Oh shit. You saw one, you waved. And if you were, they weren't looking, you never felt like
*  they were looking to get you. Crime was low. So we'll see how that relationship has to be
*  worked on in the city of Austin right now, you know, quite a bit. Yeah. What were your thoughts
*  when the whole idea to defund the police came to fruition? Well, let's break that down one,
*  defund the police that moniker. If you want it to say it, it's almost like it should have been
*  renamed because defund the police does not sound anything like there's been money reallocated to
*  different areas of handling some police exercise. It sounds like you got a million, we're taking
*  300,000. Good luck. Yeah. And it's not exactly what it is to be fair. The community and the police,
*  and not just in Austin, but all over, and I think they are doing this in Miami to bring up Miami,
*  need to get back together. And the community needs to say, here's what's unfair. Here's how,
*  I feel unfair as a black man or a person of color or whatever situation. Here's my problem
*  with my relationship with you as cops. Well, the police got to get clear to go,
*  okay, our whole force isn't screwed up. We have to have law and order. Do we all agree on that?
*  Yes, we can all agree on that. We've got a few bad apples that either need to be trained better.
*  So we don't have those kind of bad apples or cops choking under, and I mean the word as in
*  fumbling at the goal line. I don't mean literally choking. I mean that don't follow through on their
*  duty in the right way when they're under the gun, under the heat of the moment. That's what I mean.
*  There are cops that have done that. So few of these bad apples need to be removed, but they also,
*  we need to make sure we're training them better. Now, also the cops need to go to the community
*  and go, can y'all remember and understand our point of view that we're like the tow truck
*  driver. We're not called when there's good news. We're called when it's bad news. So we're coming
*  in going, looking for trouble. All right. So we're already under stress if we even get a call.
*  So can y'all help us in our way that we communicate? Can we get trust again that
*  if a cop says, hey, stand still, take your hands out, you probably hold them up. Yep.
*  I'm doing that, that we're not going to be, something's not going to happen to us.
*  That shouldn't. That there will be a, you know, because obviously the situations like that,
*  you're not being called. You're not in that situation when it's good news.
*  You know, so everyone's already tensions are high, but that's, you know, as far as the fund,
*  we're going to see, we're going to see if this reallocation of money like in Austin and other
*  places, how that works. I mean, my first gut instinct was I don't see how that repairs
*  the relationship between the community and the police force. I don't see how that's coming
*  together. I don't see how that's going to rehabilitate that relationship. And now you
*  have spite on both sides. And again, we're going to see, I don't know if we really had a bird in
*  hand when we made the change. Do we have, we practice these other, have we seen these other
*  forms where the reallocated money goes to for 911 calls and stuff? We've seen these other forms
*  work. Have we seen them be improvement? I don't know. So hopefully we'll see if this is just sort
*  of guinea pig in the idea. We'll see how it works. But I'm more for saying, okay, instead of taking
*  away your money and your funds, which you could use to train better and work on the relationship
*  of what your job is and what you expect and what communities expect from you. I'd rather have done
*  that than pull money from them. So we're going to see how this experiment goes.
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I think they need training. They need more training and more
*  understanding. I think we all need to understand that there's a tremendous amount of these people
*  that are under insane stress every day and they probably have massive PTSD. And if you're, every
*  time you're pulling somebody over, you're worried about getting shot. Every time you're visiting
*  someone's apartment for a domestic abuse case, you're worried you're going to get killed or
*  you're going to see someone killed. You've seen murders and deaths and the human mind is not
*  designed to deal with that kind of stress day in, day out. And a lot of these people are,
*  when you see these horrible reactions that cops have to situations where they do completely
*  overstep their boundaries and abuse people. I think a lot of those people are really
*  fucked up by the time they get to that point. And I don't...
*  Yeah, a lot of those people were fucked up before they got to that point. Before they even became
*  a cop or they became a cop for the right reason. They had personal problems before they got caught.
*  And we need to filter those people out. And that also comes through training, the same kind of
*  training that they filter people out through the military. You want to be a Navy SEAL,
*  you got to go through buds and good luck. If you have a lot of character flaws,
*  you're not going to make it. They will be exposed. And I think that counseling and training and then
*  communication with the community is what we need. We don't need to defund them. It seems like a
*  popular social sentiment that people are repeating because it puts you in this ideology of a person
*  who cares and is progressive. But I don't think it's ever been fleshed out. I don't think people
*  have thought it out in the long term. And if you're looking at the consequences of how this is
*  playing out in New York City, homicides are up by hundreds of percent, burglaries, armed robberies,
*  everything's up. It's not good. The defunding of the police has been horrible for New York City.
*  The consequences have been the exact opposite of what everybody hoped they'd be.
*  Right.
*  I'm worried about that here as well. But Governor Abbott has stepped in and said he's going to put
*  a stop to that, which is, you know, there's talk about not giving the towns that do this,
*  they're not going to have access to property taxes. And this is, you know, obviously there's no income
*  tax in Austin and in the state of Texas. So the governor has supposedly stepped in and going to
*  iron this out. So I'm hoping it works out and cooler heads will prevail.
*  Me too. I'm with the training and have more reverence for the job and understand
*  they're called in when they're not called in when it's good news. You know, my brother
*  Rooster has a real good, interesting take, I think, on like, you know, gun control.
*  And Texas is a big right to carry state and gun state. But
*  he brought up the samurai sword, how there was a reverence for it. And I remember how we were
*  brought up. You got your toy gun and then you got your daisy, one pump. And until you'd mastered
*  that, like not turning and ever if you turned and even though it wasn't cocked, if it was aimed
*  at someone, you got the gun taken away from you. You know what I mean? But you had to master the
*  daisy gun first. And then after years of that, you moved up to the 22 and you had to master that.
*  And you had to make sure it was always unloaded and put back in the case. You've got a reverence
*  for this tool. There's a long sort of initiation reverence before you could move up to a larger
*  gun. We've lost a reverence for that tool. And the samurai sword is a good example because there's
*  a reverence for that. There's an initiation period to get to where you could have that.
*  And I think that'd be, you know, that's kind of one of the places where I lie with the,
*  that it's too easy to get a gun sometimes. That there should be that background check,
*  which goes back into what we're talking about with police force. Background check, training,
*  have a reverence for the job, understand the expectations, understand it's a high stress job.
*  Can you handle it? Let's learn how to handle it. Because they have to call audibles in the moment
*  that our life is audibles. Yeah. And as we said, get rid of the ones who can't because it is a
*  hard job and hard jobs are not for everybody. And that's, that punishes the good cops.
*  When someone does a horrible thing like the George Floyd case, all those good cops who would never
*  think about doing that ever in their life ever are lumped into the same category as that guy.
*  And I think that's awful. Yep. Agreed. Yeah. Listen, man, I enjoy talking to you. This was
*  great. I really do. And I wish you luck with your book and I've loved your movies and I wish you
*  nothing but success and, and let's get together and break bread someday. I look forward to it,
*  Joe. Thanks, man. Enjoy talking to you and I look forward to doing it in person. Let's do it,
*  brother. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck with the book. Goodbye.
